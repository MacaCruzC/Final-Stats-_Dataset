Texto completo: President Trump reportedly urged the Australian prime minister to help Attorney General William Barr with an investigation that he hopes will discredit former special counsel Robert Mueller’s 18-month probe.
The conversation with Prime Minister Scott Morrison came during a recent phone call, a restricted transcript of which only a few close aides were privy to, according to the New York Times.
The phone call, which according to one source was at the behest of Barr, intended to ask for Australia’s help with the Justice Department’s inquiry into the Russian collusion investigation, which ended without any evidence that Trump conspired with Russia.
“The Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on matters under investigation," the Australian government said in a statement on Monday. "The PM confirmed this readiness once again in conversation with the President."
News of the phone call to Morrison comes amid scrutiny over another phone call that Trump had on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That phone call ended up being a central tenet of an August whistleblower complaint against Trump.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced an impeachment inquiry into Trump, after which the transcript of the phone call was released. The whistleblower complaint was also released last week. The call and complaint have prompted some Democrats who previously didn’t support impeachment to now support it, although Trump claims the call and complaint clear him of any wrongdoing.
Trump suggested in the call that Ukraine should investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who was on the board of a company owned by Ukrainian oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky. Zlochevsky was being investigated by top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, though it is in dispute how serious that investigation was. Trump also suggested that Ukraine should look into issues surrounding the alleged involvement of some Ukrainians in 2016 presidential election interference.
Biden boasted in 2018 that, as vice president, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine didn’t fire Shokin, which Trump's allies have said was because of the investigation. Democrats have said such was part of a U.S. and European effort to oust Shokin as ineffective and a hindrance to Ukraine’s anti-corruption investigations. Ukraine removed Shokin in 2016.
The DOJ has also made it clear that Trump never told Barr to contact Ukraine about any investigation of Biden, nor did Barr ever discuss these issues with Ukraine or with Trump's attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
Last week, the Justice Department revealed that U.S. Attorney John Durham, picked by Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, is investigating whether Ukraine and a variety of other countries were involved in any 2016 election efforts.
“A Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,” DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said last Wednesday. “While the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.”
The DOJ denied that Barr or Durham had been working with Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in any Ukraine-related efforts.
The Trump administration's interest in records potentially in Australia's possession likely stems from the fact that information from Australian diplomat Alexander Downer about Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos was used to justify the launch of the Trump-Russia investigation in the summer of 2016.
On May 10, 2016, while at Kensington Wine Rooms in London, Papadopolous allegedly told Downer that he'd been told by the mysterious Maltese academic Joseph Mifsud that Russia was in possession of damaging information on then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's, believed to be her emails. Downer passed this information along to the U.S. government a couple months later, and it is alleged that this meeting is what led to the launch of the FBI’s investigation into the Trump campaign in July 2016.
“To this day, I don't remember actually ever sharing that information with this person that I guess triggered this whole investigation," Papadopolous testified to Congress in October 2018. "But like I said, I remember many other facets of that meeting."
The Mueller report confirmed the important role that the information from Downer played in the official launching of the FBI’s Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation. The probe, dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane”, was launched on July 31, 2016, just after Wikileaks began releasing emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee. The impetus for the opening of the inquiry was when “a foreign government” — namely Australia — contacted the FBI about Downer’s interactions with Papadopoulos. Mueller wrote that Australia’s information prompted the FBI “to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities.” Mueller ultimately “did not establish” any criminal conspiracy between the Kremlin and anyone associated with Trump.
Mueller's report only went as far as to say Mifsud “had connections to Russia” and “maintained various Russian contacts," including a with a former employee of the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll farm that investigators said carried out a social media disinformation campaign to sow discord in the 2016 election. As part of Mueller’s Russia investigation, Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to making false statements to the FBI about his contacts with Mifsud and served 12 days in prison late last year.
Mifsud has denied that he told Papadopoulos the Russians had Clinton's emails, and Mifsud’s attorney, Stephan Roh, claims his client has cooperated with Western intelligence, not Russian intelligence, aligning with what some GOP investigators, such as Republican congressman Devin Nunes, have said. Roh also said Durham was seeking an interview with Mifsud.
Durham has been Barr's right hand as the two look into the complicated and classified issues surrounding how an investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties with Russia got its start, though the U.S. attorney from Connecticut has been virtually silent since his selection.
Trump gave Barr “full and complete authority to declassify information” related to the origins of the Trump-Russia probe in May after Barr had infuriated Democrats when he said “spying did occur” on the Trump campaign and refused to backtrack. Republicans have alleged that foreign intelligence agencies, like those in western Europe, may have played a role in eavesdropping on or otherwise monitoring Trump campaign associates in 2016.
Durham’s investigation is separate from the one that was just finished by DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The DOJ watchdog investigated allegations of abuses of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the DOJ and FBI, and Horowitz has spoken with Durham, who is handling any criminal referrals from Horowitz’s investigation.
The Washington Examiner reached out the White House, the Justice Department, and the Australian Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet but did not immediately receive a response.

Texto completo: Here's a take no one will like: I'm confident he did it. I'm confident it's impeachable. I'm just not so sure he should be impeached for it.
Let's start at the top. It's obvious to me that President Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to launch a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden in order to tarnish the image of the Democrat best positioned to defeat him in 2020.
In the rough transcript of his conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Trump says America has been very good to Ukraine, but he wants the relationship to be more "reciprocal." Zelenskiy agrees and asks for more anti-tank missiles to deter ongoing Russian military aggression. Trump responds by asking for a two-part "favor."
First, he asks Zelenskiy to look into the 2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers (a bat-guano-crazy request, but whatever). Then, Trump mentions "the other thing" he wants.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son, that Biden stopped the prosecution, and a lot of people want to find out about that, so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great," Trump says.
The context matters as much as the text. Trump had already blocked the transfer of congressionally approved military aid. Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had been hectoring the Ukrainians for months to go after Biden (and it remains his singular obsession even now). Giuliani even admitted it last May in an interview with the New York Times. He said he was lobbying the Ukrainians to investigate Biden because "that information will be very, very helpful to my client."
And that's why Trump asked Zelenskiy to work with Giuliani.
There's more context as well. There were reportedly other calls in which Trump importuned the Ukrainians this way. Trump's explanation for why he froze the military aid to Ukraine in the first place keeps changing. On Monday he said he blocked it out of concern over Ukrainian corruption (the only corruption in the world he's passionate about, apparently). On Tuesday he said the real reason was that he wanted our allies to pony up even more money for the government he claimed was too corrupt for our aid in the first place.
Normally you'd think an inadvertent confession would settle things. But when Trump said of his call with Ukraine, "There was no pressure put on them whatsoever. But there was pressure put on with respect to Joe Biden," the assumption was that he misspoke.
We also learned Thursday that the "whistleblower" alleges the White House took extraordinary measures to hide the transcript of the call, which, if true, suggests wiser heads understood that the conversation crossed a line.
Regardless, I think Trump did it. I think it's obvious he did it. I think as more facts come to light, it will become even more obvious he did it. I also think it's obvious that this is an impeachable offense.
However, that doesn't mean I'm persuaded he must be impeached over it.
Impeachment doesn't mean "removal from office." It's the political equivalent of a grand jury indictment, with the House fully empowered to impeach any action it deems impeachable. It's up to the Senate to decide whether a president should be removed.
The Federalist Papers are clear: Impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. Illegal acts are surely impeachable, but not all impeachable acts are illegal. If the president stood on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and shouted obscenities on national television while dancing in the nude, that would be impeachable but not illegal (FCC violations notwithstanding).
Impeachment is ultimately a question of whether a president violated the public trust. But there's nothing in the Constitution that says a president must be impeached for violating the public trust. I can list any number of occasions when presidents have done that and it never even occurred to anyone that they should be impeached for it.
It's a prudential question with good arguments on both sides. If I were Nancy Pelosi, I'd be even more torn than she's clearly been. In the modern era, we've never had the drama of an impeachment process in a president's first term or in the run-up to a re-election. We've never had a lot of things that we've had under Trump.
Absent new facts, the GOP-controlled Senate will not remove Trump. The president would claim "exoneration," and his behavior would become normalized for future presidents. So I'm not sure Democrats are right to pursue impeachment. I'm sure Republicans are wrong to pretend that what Trump did was totally fine.

Texto completo: BELFAST, Maine -- The Afari mobility device used by a Belfast man who suffered a traumatic brain injury is the product of two University of Maine professors with a mission.
For them, the Afari is not academic. It's personal. That's because Stephen Gilson and Elizabeth DePoy not only teach disability studies -- they are both persons with disabilities. And when Gilson convinced DePoy in 2008 that she should do a triathlon, she was game but ran into a major problem during training. She realized her "terrible balance" would prevent her from moving from her treadmill to the streets because she would be falling over.
"We looked around for a device, and we could only find stigmatized, ugly devices," DePoy said. "Stephen's background is in art. I said, 'Let's invent something that looks good and that functions, too.'"
Between the two of them and Vince Cacesse, a friend who is a professor of mechanical engineering at the university, they came up with a prototype for the Afari. A combination of details make it special, they said. The three-wheeled device allows users to stand up straight -- not hunched over -- as they walk or run with the balance and stability support they need. It has brakes and active steering, and just as they had intended, its functionality is matched by its sleek, contemporary appearance.

It even was selected in 2017 to be part of the "Access + Ability" exhibit at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York City.
"There's the Afari Mobility Aid which, when in use, just looks as if you're walking your bike instead of riding it," the New York Times wrote in an article about the exhibit.
That kind of response is just what DePoy and Gilson were hoping for.
"We wanted a design that would be functional, that somebody would be proud to use in public," Gilson said.
Many mobility devices do not have that goal. Things such as walkers, wheeled walkers and canes help people get around, but they often have another effect, the couple said.
"People are stooped over. You feel sorry for them. They look debilitated," DePoy said. "My dad, who is 93, uses a wheeled walker. He doesn't want to go out in it. It's embarrassing. Whereas, if you see the Afari, people walk over and say, 'Wow, isn't that cool.' You stand up straight. You look them in the eye. It's functional -- you can go anywhere."
The mobility device, which has been through seven design cycles, is now the flagship product for Mobility Tech in Brunswick, a new company that started as a partnership with the University of Maine. Its CEO, Ryan Beaumont, said Mobility Tech is now in "growth mode" and has so far sold 30 Afari devices to customers in New England, and even as far away as England and Hawaii. The cost for the devices starts at $1,875 and although at the moment, insurance companies see it as an exercise product and therefore not covered under policies, he hopes that will change.
"We've got people with brain tumors that are running again," he said, adding that the best part of his job is hearing stories from customers like Seekins. "I honestly didn't expect the overwhelming positive response. Now people can go outside their homes without being afraid of falling. It's more than physical health. The social aspect is amazing, too."

NBA NIXES DINWIDDIE'S BIG PLANS

Texto completo: Forward-thinking Nets point guard Spencer Dinwiddie, who has developed a plan to turn his three-year contract extension worth $34 million into a digital investment vehicle, was told by the NBA on Friday that it is not allowed because it violates the collective bargaining agreement. Dinwiddie disputed that notion following training camp practice on Saturday, described a statement by the league as "misleading" and said he hopes to resolve the situation and move forward with his plan.
In its statement for an article in The New York Times, the NBA said Dinwiddie plans to sell a "tokenized security" and added, "The described arrangement is prohibited by the CBA, which provides that 'no player shall assign or otherwise transfer to any third party his right to receive compensation from the team under his uniform player contract.'"
Under Dinwiddie's plan, investors would purchase digital tokens with a guaranteed rate of return rather than buying bonds from a broker. He hoped to raise a lump sum of $4.95 million to $13.5 million upfront. Dinwiddie said he and his lawyers previously discussed the matter with the NBA and the NBA Players Association.
"We constructed it in a way that doesn't violate the CBA," Dinwiddie said. "It's very simple. Once the Nets pay me, that's the end of it. If I wanted to shoot the money into deep space, technically, I could. It would be really dumb, it would be outrageously stupid. I wouldn't advise anybody to do something like that.
"I love the league and I look forward to talking to them. At the end of the day, it was like, 'I'm not doing what you're saying I'm doing.' So, publicly saying I can violate the CBA when I'm not . . . it's kind of misleading."
Dinwiddie said his idea of marketing himself to fans as an investment asset might help promote the NBA. Dinwiddie plans further discussions with the league, saying, "It could be as simple as a misunderstanding."

Texto completo: Writer Ann Hood will visit the public library in Kennebunk Wednesday to speak about, read from, sell and sign her new memoir "Kitchen Yarns: Notes on Life, Love and Food" (W.W. Norton & Co., $24.95). The book is a collection of touching essays (and recipes) about food and - through its lens - her first love, her parents' romance, raising children, the death of her daughter, the death of her marriage, the birth of new love, and more.
Hood, who lives in Rhode Island, wrote her first novel, "Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine," in 1987 while working as an airline stewardess, or, as she puts it in her author bio, "on international flights and on the Train to the Plane, which was the subway out to JFK." Since then, Hood has written nine other books and been published in The New York Times, The Paris Review, Bon Appetit and elsewhere. She has also won two Best American Food Writing Awards.
Here's an excerpt from chapter 2 of the bittersweet but ultimately optimistic "Kitchen Yarns" entitled "The Best Fried Chicken":
"I have massaged it with herbs. Bathed in it buttermilk. Immersed it in water, sugar, and salt. Rolled it in cornflakes, panko, seasoned crumbs. I have spent three days tending to it, double-dipping and double-dredging and double-bathing. Ham has been involved. Also, hot pepper flakes. But now I know that the finest way to make fried chicken is to dust it with heavily salted and peppered flour and fry it in lard until crisp. That's the way my father did it, and his mother before him. That's the way they still do it in his part of Indiana, which is to say the southeast corner, whose Hoosiers are more Kentucky than Midwest. But like all children when they grow up, I doubted and questioned him and his chicken."

Texto completo: As presidential candidates race to rack up money this weekend with multiple candidates flocking to the Bay Area for high-dollar fundraisers the debate over impeachment and President Donald Trump's dealings with Ukraine is becoming a top moneymaker.
And not just for the Democrats hoping to unseat him.
In the 24 hours after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the opening of an impeachment inquiry over allegations that Trump asked Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 rival Joe Biden, the president's reelection campaign raised $5 million in small-dollar donations, the campaign said. That came in part from merchandise like "Impeach this!" T-shirts and appeals to join an "impeachment defense task force."
"A BIG thank you to @SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats," Trump's son Eric tweeted, highlighting the fundraising numbers.
The Democratic online fundraising platform ActBlue which all of the party's 2020 presidential candidates use took in $4.6 million Tuesday, The New York Times reported, making it one of the service's biggest days in months.
On Facebook, candidates blanketed news feeds with ads about the Ukraine controversy, depicting it as either a national moment of crisis or a total hoax. And they filled supporters' inboxes with dozens of emails with all-capital subject lines.
"BREAKING: Trump memo bombshell," blared one Harris email that included a screenshot of the rough transcript of the Ukraine phone call released by the White House and urged supporters to "rush a contribution to Kamala's presidential campaign to elect a president who will fight for truth, justice and the rule of law."
The political hurricane came with good timing for the candidates Monday is the last day of the third fundraising quarter of the year, a milestone after which the totals campaigns raise will be heavily scrutinized.
The Bay Area will be a hive of fundraising activity this weekend and next week. Democrats Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker all have high-dollar fundraisers scheduled, and Biden will be in Palo Alto and San Francisco on Thursday. His wife, former second lady Jill Biden, had fundraisers in Los Altos Hills and San Francisco on Friday and is set to appear at events in Sonoma and Fremont today.
Trump's focus on Joe Biden raises questions for the former vice president's campaign, in part because it gives Trump plenty of opportunities to repeat unsubstantiated attacks about Joe Biden and his son Hunter's work in Ukraine. But for now, at least, the Biden campaign seems to be welcoming the attention from the White House.
"Biden can cast himself as the candidate that Trump is most afraid of," said Jack Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College. "In the short term, this is going to engender some sympathy for him on the Democratic side, and it's going to be a rallying point for his contributors."
At several events in Southern California on Thursday, Joe Biden bashed Trump over the scandal, saying the president was trying to "hijack an election," and read part of the whistleblower's complaint.
His wife was more circumspect Friday when she spoke to about 50 people at the airy, ultramodern home of tech investor Junaid Qurashi and architect Malika Junaid a house with a design inspired by the "Star Trek" Starship Enterprise, featuring a glass pedestal with a dining table that protrudes 10 feet above an indoor swimming pool, a solar-powered airplane hangar-style door and a glass suction elevator inspired by the line, "Beam me up, Scotty!"
Jill Biden, who wore a bright yellow dress and stood at a music stand in front of a panoramic window overlooking the San Francisco Bay, made no mention of the Ukraine controversy. But she said she was disappointed at the divisiveness and ugliness in today's politics.
"When we turn on the news today, we're all told that we've never been so divided," Jill Biden said. "We can barely sit through a segment of the news, right? I mean, aren't you all turning off your TVs?"
She told attendees, who snacked on pita bread, samosas and chicken tikka, that her husband would be "a president we can be proud of, a president who brings people together rather than tears families apart, a president who believes that our best days are ahead of us."
Dilawar Syed, a member of the Biden for President Finance Committee, alluded to the Ukraine controversy in brief remarks following Jill Biden's speech as he encouraged the attendees to open their checkbooks.
"The last few days of news should be a reminder, one more time, that what's happening in this country actually doesn't happen anywhere else in the world anymore," he said. "And if you have four more years of this, No. 45, we will cease to exist as we do today as a nation as a society."

Excompañeros del abogado de Trump, Rudy Giuliani, creen que cometió crímenes por trama ucraniana

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Donald Trump, es una de las personas que acabaron en el centro de una gran tormenta política que involucra actualmente al presidente de Estados Unidos. Un viaje que el letrado hizo a España este verano podría representar uno de sus encargos recientes que más dolores de cabeza podría costarle.
El nuevo escándalo que embistió a Trump estalló después de que un informante anónimo denunciara en una queja dirigida al Congreso que el presidente intentó presionar a su homólogo de Ucrania para que este lo ayudara con un plan para investigar a Joe Biden , político demócrata y actualmente destacado rival político. Giuliani, quien fue alcalde de Nueva York entre 1994 y 2001, tuvo un papel clave en esta maniobra política, según el denunciante.
Mientras que la Cámara de Representantes la mayoría demócrata abrió una investigación de juicio político contra el mandatario para averiguar si abusó de su poder, seis abogados que trabajaron con Giuliani en el Departamento de Justicia, donde el actual abogado personal del presidente cubrió distintos cargos, aseguraron a NBC News que creen que el letrado, una de las personas más cercanas a Trump, cometió crímenes en esas circunstancias.
En su viaje de finales de julio a la capital del país ibérico, Giuliani se reunió con un asesor de Volodymyr Zelenskiy, el presidente ucraniano, según el informante. El encuentro se produjo un día después de que Trump llamara a su homólogo para pedirle que investigara a Biden y su hijo Hunter, involucrado en negocios en el país eslavo, por posibles actos de corrupción. Y la misión servía supuestamente para afianzar ese plan.
“Ciertamente, este no es el Giuliani que conozco”, afirmó a NBC Jeffrey Harris, quien trabajó como asistente principal de Giuliani cuando estaba en el Departamento de Justicia durante la administración del presidente Ronald Reagan. “Creo que el Giuliani que conozco pondría bajo juicio al Giuliani de hoy”.
El excompañero del abogado de Trump , que ahora ejerce la profesión privadamente, agregó que el Gobierno de EEUU tiene “todo un aparato” que está configurado para tratar con funcionarios extranjeros. “Y Rudy Giuliani no es uno de ellos”, dijo.
La queja del informante anónimo asegura que el abogado también tuvo otros contactos con oficiales ucranianos. “Si esto se considerara como uso de recursos del Gobierno para beneficio propio, esta conducta estaría asociada a una serie de delitos.”.
NBC contactó en total a siete ex colegas de Giuliani. Uno no contestó, pero todos los demás coincidieron en no defender su conducta. E indicaron una serie de delitos que podría haber cometido, desde la violación de leyes electorales federales hasta el soborno y la extorsión.
Bruce Fein, quien trabajó en el Departamento de Justicia con Giuliani a principios de la década de 1980, dijo que cree que Giuliani podría ser procesado por violar las leyes federales de elecciones si se demuestra que intentó influir en la campaña de las presidenciales de 2020, en las que Biden quiere postularse como adversario a Trump.
“Las leyes electorales federales hacen que sea ilegal solicitar algo de valor de un Gobierno o ciudadanos extranjeros para influir en el resultado de una elección”, sostuvo. Fein dijo que Giuliani también podría exponerse a cargos por soborno ya que Trump supuestamente retuvo fondos militares para presionar a Ucrania. “Si Giuliani estuviera al tanto de eso, podría ser cómplice de Trump al conspirar para solicitar un soborno”, dijo.
Daniel Richman, quien trabajó con Giuliani en la Oficina del Fiscal de los Estados Unidos en Manhattan a fines de la década de 1980, dijo que necesitaba ver más evidencia antes de tomar una determinación concluyente. Pero estuvo de acuerdo en que un esfuerzo por ayudar en un complot para retener fondos de una potencia extranjera a cambio de un favor personal o político podría exponer al abogado de Trump a cargos criminales que podrían ir del fraude a la extorsión.
Otros ex fiscales que trabajaron con Giuliani plantearon la cuestión de que aparentemente influyó en la política exterior estadounidense, lo que podría suponer violación de la antigua Ley Logan, aprobada en 1799, que prohíbe a los ciudadanos privados negociar con un gobierno extranjero en nombre de los EEUU.
GIULIANI NIEGA
Giuliani calificó estas opiniones de “tonterías”. “No saben de qué están hablando. ¿Qué crímenes?”. También dijo que no pudo haber sobornado a nadie porque no ofreció nada de valor a los ucranianos. “¿Son estos tipos abogados o son imbéciles?”, preguntó en referencia a sus excompañeros, antes de negar que haya ejercido algún tipo de influencia en las elecciones.
El exfiscal federal John Flannery, que trabajó con él a mediados de la década de los setenta, dijo que estaba desconcertado por lo que describió como un flagrante abuso de la ley por su parte.
“Se ha puesto en una posición de ayudar e incitar, y tal vez dar comienzo, a un intercambio de favores con un gobierno extranjero para una campaña política estadounidense a instancias del propio candidato”, dijo Flannery. “Ninguno de los dos lo niega, y de hecho lo están profusamente, repetidamente y dolorosamente admitiendo”.
Flannery dijo que el Giuliani de hoy no se parece en nada al hombre con el que trabajó hace unos 40 años. “Es una sombra del que fue el mejor Rudy, y no el gran abogado que pensé que sería”.
La llamada de Trump a su homólogo ucraniano fue descalificada esta semana, y su contenido difundido en un resumen. También se difundió públicamente la queja del denunciante. Fuentes de la Casa Blanca aseguraron a algunos medios (CNN, The New York Times, The Associated Press) que la administración restringió la accesibilidad al contenido de las conversaciones entre Trump y los líderes de Rusia, Vladimir Putin, y la familia real de Arabia Saudí .

Texto completo: The accolades for the Finger Lakes wine region of New York to continue to accumulate.
The most recent example: "Wine & Spirits Magazine" has named Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery as one of the Top 100 Wineries of 2019.
Also on the worldwide list is such prestigious wineries as Champagne Krug in France; Penfolds in Australia; and Stags' Leap Winery and Tablas Creek in California. Dr. Frank was the only winery named from the Finger Lakes region of New York. The winery previously was named in the "Wine & Spirits Magazine" Top 100 in 2016.
Over the past few years, the winery has rolled out more personalized tasting experiences geared toward the varied interests of its visitors. It remodeled its tasting rooms and allowed each guest to choose wines to taste from the entire list including reserve and single vineyard wines. The Terrace at 1886 allows guests to enjoy flights of wine paired with local cheeses on the new outside terrace overlooking the vineyards on Keuka Lake. Now in its fourth year, the 1886 Food and Wine Experience offers guests a thorough educational tour and tasting paired with creative small bites.
Dr. Konstantin Frank Winery is at 9749 Middle Road, a few miles north of Hammondsport, Steuben County. The winery, which opened in 1962, was at the forefront of the post-Prohibition wine movement in the Finger Lakes. The vineyards on Keuka Lake are home to some of the oldest vines in the U.S.
More Finger Lakes accolades • For the second year in a row, the picturesque Finger Lakes wine region was named top wine region in the USA TODAY 10Best Reader's Choice poll. The Finger Lakes Wine Festival in Watkins Glen and F.L.X. Table in Geneva also finished in the Top 10 in their respective categories.
• Finger Lakes wines regularly have strong showings in the national wine press. The most recent example: New York Times wine writer Eric Asimov included Nathan K Finger Lakes Dry Riesling in a list of 20 wines under $20.

REVIEW --- The American Legacy Of Gandhi --- He never set foot in the U.S., but his life and ideas inspired millions and provoked social change.

Texto completo: On Oct. 2, the world will mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mohandas Karamchand "Mahatma" Gandhi. Gandhi never visited the U.S., but few non-Americans have had such a great impact on American life. His work as a freedom fighter and social reformer in India was closely followed in the U.S.
In the 1920s, when Gandhi launched a nonviolent mass movement against British colonial rule in India, his struggle was widely reported in the African-American press. Thinkers such as W.E.B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier wrote about him, and several influential African-Americans visited him to seek advice, including Howard Thurman, later a mentor to Martin Luther King Jr. Thurman wrote of how he had been subjected to an intense examination by the Indian leader: "persistent, pragmatic questions about American Negroes, about the course of slavery, and how we had survived it." As Thurman prepared to leave, Gandhi offered him this hopeful prediction: "It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world."
As a young man, King read Gandhi closely. In 1958, as he was making his name as a civil rights leader in the American South, King published a tribute to Gandhi in an Indian newspaper describing the deep influence the "Father of the Indian Nation" had on his thought: "I came to see at a very early stage that a synthesis of Gandhi's method of nonviolence and the Christian ethic of love is the best weapon available to Negroes in this struggle for freedom and human dignity. . . . His spirit is a continual reminder to oppressed people that it is possible to resist evil and yet not resort to violence."
During Gandhi's lifetime, however, his most fervent American admirer was another clergyman, the white New York pastor John Haynes Holmes, who in 1920 helped to found the American Civil Liberties Union. The following year, Holmes delivered a sermon titled "Who Is the Greatest Man in the World?" His answer was Gandhi, who reminded him of Jesus: "He lives his life; he speaks his word, he suffers, strives, and will some day nobly die, for his kingdom upon earth."
At the time, Gandhi was in the middle of the Non-Cooperation Movement, his first major campaign against British rule in India. This involved the burning of foreign cloth to promote indigenous Indian industry, the nonpayment of colonial taxes, and the withdrawal of Indian patriots from serving in colonial offices, universities and law courts. The struggle was widely covered in the American press. In a "cynical, materialistic and disillusioned" age, wrote the liberal journal the Nation, there had emerged a man "whose singular devotion, unselfishness and spiritual power have won him the almost superstitious reverence of his own people and the respect of the skeptical critics."
Gandhi appealed to American radicals because of his anti-colonialism, and to American Christians because of his simple life and message of brotherhood. While he opposed British imperialism, he often said that he had no hatred for individual Englishmen. Indeed, his closest friend was a British priest, C.F. Andrews, who wrote several books and many articles praising Gandhi for an American audience. The Chicago-based magazine the Christian Century repeatedly proposed Gandhi's name for a Nobel Peace Prize, though it failed to persuade the Anglophilic Norwegians to award him the honor.
In 1930, Gandhi launched another mass nonviolent struggle, known as the Salt March, since its principal target was an oppressive colonial law that prohibited Indians from making their own salt. Following the Salt March, Gandhi spent many months in prison. When he was released, he received a flood of letters conveying the admiration of Americans for his struggle. A particularly moving letter came from a Chicago resident named Arthur Sewell. The "Negroes of America," Sewell wrote, were "keenly and sympathetically" following Gandhi's movement. African-Americans "sympathize and suffer" with India and Indians, "for here, in America, they not only rob us of our possessions and hurdle us into the prisons unjustly, but they mob, lynch and burn us up with fire. . . . May God Bless you," Sewell declared, "and enable you to carry on the great battle for righteous adjustment until you win a glorious victory for the common cause of the lowly."
The Salt March made Gandhi immensely famous in America; Time Magazine named him Man of the Year. A certain James B. Pond of New York's Pond Bureau, self-professed "Managers of American Tours for World Celebrities," urged Gandhi to capitalize on this acclaim by making a tour of the U.S. "When you visit this country," Pond promised, "you will receive a welcome such as no man has ever had, and it is going to require the utmost knowledge, the utmost sympathy and utmost tact on the part of a manager to meet the situation." But the idea of a lucrative lecture tour didn't appeal to the austere and ascetic Indian.
Despite never setting foot in the U.S., Gandhi remained much on the mind of Americans. In 1932, a charming tribute appeared in the form of an advertisement by Saks, the New York department store, playing on the fact that Gandhi made his own clothes. Filling almost a whole page in the New York Times in 1932, the ad featured an illustration of four men wearing suits, each reading a newspaper, with the slogan "EVERYBODY BUT GANDHI." The text underneath said, in part: "The Mahatma chooses to spin his own . . . such as it is . . . and that's his business! He needn't read this ad. But all the rest of you gentlemen prefer to wear good suits . . . and that's our business." Evidently, the well-dressed man in New York knew very well what the Indian leader wore -- or didn't wear.
Gandhi was murdered in 1948 by a Hindu fundamentalist enraged at his insistence that, in an independent India, Muslims and Christians must have the same rights as Hindus. Six decades later, an African-American became president of the U.S., his rise made possible by the struggle for racial equality that had Gandhi as one of its exemplars. In an interview shortly after taking office, Barack Obama was asked to choose a figure from history he would like to dine with. Gandhi, he answered, adding that of course it would be a frugal meal.
Today there are statues of Gandhi in many American cities, and courses on him are taught in numerous colleges and universities. His name and example once inspired the civil-rights movement; now it animates environmental debates. Visiting Arizona State University in Tempe, I saw a campaign for public transportation that invoked my most famous countryman with the tagline "Even Gandhi walked."
Gandhi wore little and ate even less. Yet he may have influenced the citizens of the most prosperous society on Earth more than any non-American in modern times.

R-Battle Ground

Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Battle Ground, said she believes the whistleblower report released to Congress on Thursday does not prove that President Donald Trump abused his power to advance his own personal political agenda.
“After reviewing it, it remains unproven that the president engaged in a quid pro quo. These allegations remain serious, but for the sake of this nation, we should all follow a process that does not put conclusions before facts,” Herrera Beutler said in a written statement. She added that she appreciated the whistleblower report's timely release.
The report, which caused an uproar on Capitol Hill as talks of impeachment continue to pick up momentum among lawmakers, is thought to have come from a CIA officer who had been stationed at the White House, according to the New York Times.
“In the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple U.S. Government officials that the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,” the nine-page reports opens.
“I am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute “‘a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law or Executive Order,'” the whistleblower wrote. “I am also concerned that these actions pose risks to U.S. national security and undermine the U.S. Government's efforts to deter and counter foreign interference in U.S. elections.”
Herrera Beutler said she believes the report did not prove wrongdoing on the part of the president. Her statement repeated the same sentiment she expressed on Wednesday, when a memorandum on Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was made public.
The rough transcript, reconstructed from notes and recollections of national security staff, showed the president repeatedly pressuring Zelenskiy to work with potential investigations connected to Joseph Biden, the former vice president and Democratic front-runner for the 2020 presidential election.
The call came a few days after the president unexpectedly froze nearly $400 million in aid to the Ukraine. In the phone call, Trump said the U.S. had “done a lot for Ukraine,” and said “I would like you to do us a favor” before asking Zelenskiy to cooperate with Attorney General William Barr in opening a corruption investigation into Biden. He did not mention the stalled aid package.
That, too, did not constitute a “quid pro quo,” Herrera Beutler said.
“The phone call by itself does not present the facts to prove what has been alleged — and any subsequent congressional action related to this must be led by facts,” Herrera Beutler said.

Texto completo: Los presidentes demócratas de tres comités de la Cámara de Representantes citaron el viernes al Secretario de Estado Mike Pompeo para que entregue documentos relacionados con Ucrania que, según dicen, pertenecen a la investigación de juicio político contra el presidente Trump, reporta Fox News.
Los presidentes de los comités de Asuntos Exteriores, Inteligencia y Supervisión de la Cámara solicitaron inicialmente una larga lista de documentos el 9 de septiembre y enviaron una carta de seguimiento el lunes.
“Su incumplimiento o negativa a cumplir con la citación constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de destitución de la Cámara”, escribieron el presidente de Inteligencia, Adam Schiff, D-Calif .; Eliot Engel, presidente de Asuntos Exteriores, D-N.Y .; y el presidente de supervisión Elijah Cummings , D-Md.
Los presidentes mencionados también solicitaron correspondencia y documentos del Departamento de Estado que datan del 20 de enero de 2017 hasta el presente. Los documentos se relacionan con informes de que Trump presionó a los funcionarios ucranianos para que investiguen al posible rival electoral de 2020 Joe Biden, su hijo Hunter y la actividad comercial de los Bidens en Ucrania.
Los legisladores demócratas también exigieron copias de la transcripción de la controvertida llamada de Trump el 25 de julio con el presidente ucraniano Vladimir Zelenski y una lista de funcionarios del Departamento de Estado que podrían haber estado involucrados en la conversación, según la carta. También solicitan cualquier registro del Departamento de Estado sobre Rudy Giuliani, el abogado personal de Trump, y cualquier registro relacionado con la ayuda militar de EE. UU. a Ucrania.
Pompeo tiene hasta el 4 de octubre para cumplir con las solicitudes.
En una carta separada, los presidentes notificaron a Pompeo que habían programado deposiciones para cinco funcionarios del Departamento de Estado entre el 2 y el 10 de octubre.
Esos funcionarios son el ex embajador en Ucrania, Marie Yovanovitch, el Representante Especial de Estados Unidos para las Negociaciones de Ucrania, Kurt Volker, Subsecretario Adjunto George Kent , el Consejero T. Ulrich Brechbuhl y el Embajador de los Estados Unidos en la Unión Europea, Gordon Sondland.
Todos los funcionarios, excepto Kent, son nombrados en una queja por un denunciante de la comunidad de inteligencia que acusó a Trump de “usar el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020”.
“El hecho de que ninguno de estos empleados del departamento comparezca para sus deposiciones programadas constituirá evidencia de obstrucción a la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara”, dijeron los presidentes.
NYT reportó la renuncia de Kurt Volker a su cargo el viernes.

Lakers training camp: 5 key questions as LeBron James, Anthony Davis join forces

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Santa Anita faces existential questions as fall meet opens

Texto completo: ARCADIA — Santa Anita opens its 23-day fall meet Friday with many questions to answer, and the future of horse racing in Southern California may be at stake.
As Santa Anita opens with a nine-race program, including three graded stakes races, horse owners, trainers and the operators of Santa Anita have bigger questions than which horse runs fastest.
— Will it be a safer meet than the winter-spring season from December through June, when 30 horses died either in morning workouts or during afternoon racing?
— Will Hall of Fame trainer Jerry Hollendorfer, banned from all race tracks owned by the Stronach Group since June 22, be allowed to race horses at any time during the meet?
— Is the horse population in Southern California large enough to allow the track to follow through on its plan to hold four-day race weeks, as opposed to the three-day schedule track officials were forced to adopt during the final portion of the spring meet?
— Will racing fans stay away, from both the track and the betting windows, like happened during Del Mar’s 36-day summer meet that ended Sept. 2? Del Mar enjoyed a very safe meet, but a hangover from Santa Anita’s troubles hurt its business.
— What kind of spotlight will come with the Breeders’ Cup on Nov. 1-2? Horse racing’s biggest event also raises the pressure on Santa Anita to run a safe meet.
One thing is perfectly clear, and carries no question marks: This is the most important meet in the track’s history.
“For what’s at stake, I think absolutely (it’s the most important),” said Aidan Butler, the new acting executive director of California racing for Santa Anita’s parent company, the Stronach Group. “There are a lot of eye balls on Santa Anita, both on the positive and the negative. I think we need to put our best foot forward and make sure things are done better than they’ve ever been done historically in any country.
“The way I look at it, if this many people are interested, let’s show ’em what horse racing can do. Let’s show ’em how good horse racing, when done right, truly is.”
California governor Gavin Newsom is watching closely. He issued a scathing review of horse racing when he met with reporters from the New York Times this week.
“What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned,” he told the Times. “We own that going into the next season, and we’re going to have to do something about it.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace.”
The 42-year-old Butler, a native of Great Britain who came to the Stronach Group from a Toronto law firm in 2018 and assumed his new position in early August, says he sees the need for horse racing to adapt and not conduct business as usual.
“Just because things back in the day were done a certain way and were acceptable does not mean they’ll be acceptable in today’s day and age,” he said.
For example, he cited the days when a racing fatality was treated as back-page news. The nightmare at Santa Anita has changed all of that.
“The way I actually look at it is, if a horse gets injured, everything that happened around that horse, what happened, why did it go on, that needs to be addressed, needs to be looked at,” Butler said. “This is a very fast-paced, active sport and accidents do happen. But that being said, transparency I think will set us all free. I hate to say back in the old days no one cared, well no one cared about a lot of stuff going back a few years.
“There are so many eyeballs on us now that it makes everybody wan to be better. I think if we’re going to try to grow the sport — and I’m not here to keep the status quo, I’m here to try and grow the sport — if we’re going to do that, we need to get confidence back, show (the sport) is as good and safe as can possibly be.”
Thoroughbred owner Jon Lindo is taking a wait-and-see approach, while agreeing that this is Santa Anita’s most important meet ever.
“I think it’s huge,” he said. “Right now, Santa Anita has to earn back the trust and the confidence of not only the horsemen, the owners and trainers, but the fans and the general public. The messages sent during that last meet, that was so confrontational, with the new management team in place we need to see if it’s one that everyone can work with toward a common goal.
“I mean, if this goes the wrong way, we could be out of business. That’s how important it is. It’s a short meet and unfortunately I think we’re all watching, not because we want to see the races, but we just want to see this thing go smoothly. They’ve got to earn my trust back.”
Two-time Kentucky Derby-winning trainer Doug O’Neill is taking an optimistic view.
“After the success of Del Mar (no fatalities during live racing), I can speak on the behalf of the majority of the horsemen that we’re real excited to continue it and have a real great Santa Anita,” he said. “There’s no reason why we shouldn’t.”
Is this Santa Anita’s most important meet ever?
“I haven’t thought of it in those terms,” O’Neill said, “but it’s just real important that we all work together and continue to work together, have a good open dialogue and realize we need to share in all the great times and share in all the accidental stuff.
“From what I can see, I really like the way Santa Anita is going into the meet and we’ll know more as we get going. I know we’re all optimistic that we’re going to have a heck of a meet.”
But that doesn’t mean there is no anxiety in the executive offices at Santa Anita this week. Even Del Mar officials admitted to some nervousness on the eve of their pivotal meet.
“Am I a little bit apprehensive? Of course,” Butler said. “I’ve got a few butterflies because I want everything to go as well as it should. But if preparation and hard work and having the right people around (means anything), my confidence level is pretty good.”
The Hollendorfer situation is still under review. The 73-year-old trainer with more than 7,600 lifetime victories was banned from the Stronach Group’s five race tracks — Santa Anita, Golden Gate Fields, Gulfstream Park, Laurel Park and Pimlico — after his fourth fatality at Santa Anita on June 22.
Butler would not comment on Hollendorfer, citing litigation, but he did offer a rebuttal to people who believe the Stronach Group banned Hollendorfer in an attempt to take the onus off the race track.
“There is absolutely no truth to that whatsoever,” he said. “I was involved, I was there, I was on the grounds and that was never once contemplated or thought of.”

Texto completo: After their sixth consecutive season out of the playoffs, expect the Lakers to begin training camp this weekend by talking about fresh starts and clean slates. The upcoming season might be new, but it’s not fresh or clean – the Lakers are still trying to learn from the last one.
Take Tuesday night’s appearance of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Kyle Kuzma, Dwight Howard, Quinn Cook and Talen-Horton Tucker at a WNBA playoff game in Las Vegas. There’s subtext: The players were among the Lakers invited to Vegas by James, who is trying to do more to create team chemistry this year after the franchise strained at the seams while stumbling to a 37-45 record in his first season in L.A.
It’s a new group with the same measuring stick: A veteran-laden roster that is expected to be more competitive than last season and perhaps even bring the Lakers back to their longtime place as a title contender.
With Lakers media day scheduled for Friday morning in El Segundo, here are the top stories to follow between now and the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Clippers:
1. What is the balance of power between Anthony Davis and LeBron James?
James has so far insisted that Davis will be the focal point, something Davis reiterated to Yahoo Sports in an interview earlier this month: “To have a guy like LeBron, someone of his caliber, go tell management and ownership and the coaches that he wants me to be the focal point is an honor. I know what comes with that, and that’s a lot of heavy lifting. I want to be able to do that.”
Davis has been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, but he’s yet to win big in the postseason. James has also been the focal point of every team he’s ever played for, and while signs of physical decline might be more evident in his 17th NBA season, the four-time league MVP is still going to be the one running most of the team’s plays.
There’s a natural fit to Davis’ and James’ games, particularly as pick-and-roll threats. That partnership also extends off the court, where the two men have appeared together at a variety of offseason events and share the same agent (and are slotted for starring roles in a “Space Jam” movie). But when push comes to shove, who takes the last shot? Who takes the lead in dictating habits in practice and the locker room?
There’s the matter of Davis’ leverage: He’s got just one year left on his deal, and his agent Rich Paul has promised that he will enter free agency next summer (even though the Lakers are the presumptive favorite to re-sign him). That will weigh on the minds of the team’s lead decision-makers, who must find ways to make Davis feel comfortable within the franchise. But it’s also up to James, as a co-star, to make sure the relationship remains as close as it’s appeared so far.
2. What is Frank Vogel’s stamp on the team?
The month-long process that finally led the Lakers to two-time NBA head coach Frank Vogel was a tortured one. His own introduction was overshadowed by the specter of Magic Johnson. But the 46-year-old New Jersey native has handled the awkward circumstances of his hiring as well as anyone could, outlining a bright vision for the coming season. He’s also no stranger to competing at a high level, as his best Indiana Pacers teams can attest.
The circumstances around Vogel, however, would be tricky for any coach to thread. From the politics of having two superstars, to working with an assembly of coaches who some observers have colored as possible successors, he’ll have plenty of challenges coming to L.A.
Vogel’s calling card in the past has been rugged and accountable defenses that have done just enough on offense. He’s said he’s eager to show how he’s evolved since a truncated stint in Orlando and a year-long sabbatical from coaching. But time is of the essence for Vogel to show how he can assert himself in a position that’s experienced a lot of recent turnover.
3. Who is the starting point guard?
Anyone who has watched James in the past two decades understands he will assume most of the playmaking duties. The question is who is the additional guard who starts alongside Danny Green.
There are several candidates on roughly the same footing: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Avery Bradley, Quinn Cook and Alex Caruso. There have been few signs so far of how the Lakers plan to divine a starting guard from the mix, particularly given that there are so many different strengths on the table without a clear-cut, No. 1 option on the depth chart.
There’s a good chance that the early part of the season will see a fair amount of juggling between those options to see how they fit alongside Davis, James and everyone else.
4. What does Dwight Howard bring to the table?
No one ever argued Dwight Howard can’t make a good first impression. In a preseason conference call with reporters, the eight-time All-Star’s words rang of humility.
“My goal is just to win, there’s nothing else that matters,” he said. “Whatever I have to do to be a great teammate, whatever I have to do on the court, it’s all about winning.”
The problem is Howard is well-versed in finding the right opening lines, but he hasn’t found a way to follow through on them. Including his previous Lakers tenure, he’s been an ill fit with nearly every roster he’s been a part of, despite repeated preseason oaths that he’s changed.
The compelling part of Howard is his talent. In Charlotte for his last healthy season, he averaged 16.6 points and 12.5 rebounds. The Lakers could benefit from solid and steady production in the post, as long as Howard is ready to get with the program.
There’s no problem for the team if it goes south: Howard’s reported contract details have him on a short leash. But if the Lakers can squeeze value from him, that could add a good deal of upside to their potential.
5. Can the Lakers finally get some luck with player health?
Even the summer is not kind. DeMarcus Cousins tore his ACL in August and is likely out for the year. The New York Times reported Tuesday that Kyle Kuzma, another key component for the team, might miss part of training camp with the left foot injury that kept him out of the FIBA World Cup for Team USA.
The Lakers are already walking a perilously thin rope, even before you consider that James, 34, is coming off a season when he played the fewest games of his career, and the offseason roster moves have resulted in a significantly older squad. The practice of load management is currently en vogue after Kawhi Leonard sat out nearly a quarter of the regular season then led Toronto to the 2019 NBA title, so it’s certainly possible the Lakers could look to lessen the regular-season burden on their stars.
That could help down the road, but they have to get to the postseason first. The Lakers have to win enough games in a deep Western Conference to earn a playoff spot. Having to play any significant length of time without any of their stars could prove damning to that effort. Even though the Lakers have added a second superstar, that also means losing one of their best players would create a void that is even more difficult to replace.

Texto completo: Mark von Hagen, a leading light of Russian, Eastern European, and Eurasian history and scholarship in America, died last week in Tempe, Arizona, at the age of 65. Professor emeritus of history at Arizona State, von Hagen had spent the bulk of his career at Columbia where, in 1985, he joined the history faculty after earning a Stanford doctorate and was, among other things, director of Columbia's Harriman Institute for the Advanced Study of the Soviet Union.
Yet one of von Hagen’s most significant, and surely his most unusual, achievements had to do with a journalist: Walter Duranty.

Von Hagen specialized in Slavic studies and, especially, the innumerable nationalities who populated the old Soviet empire. He was also a mainstay of scholarly associations and, in the genuine sense of the term, a public intellectual: A tireless promoter of human rights, student of civil-military relations, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He was also a character of sorts. One colleague remembered him "roaming the halls of the Harriman Institute for hours, masterfully playing the accordion during our annual Christmas parties."

With all that in mind, in 2003, the New York Times commissioned von Hagen to undertake a delicate assignment: To review the reporting of the Times' onetime Moscow bureau chief Walter Duranty (1884-1957), who had arrived in Russia shortly after the Revolution, didn't depart from Moscow until 1934, and continued as a special Times correspondent on Soviet affairs until World War II.

Duranty had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for his reporting from Moscow, and von Hagen's brief was to judge whether, as critics had long maintained, Duranty was not an objective journalist but an enthusiast for the Soviet "experiment" and beneficiary of favored treatment from the Kremlin for his favorable accounts of Joseph Stalin's dictatorship. Duranty's Pulitzer had been awarded in the midst of the Soviet drive to collectivize agriculture that resulted in the deliberate death by starvation of millions of Ukrainians. (The exact number is still a matter of debate but most estimates range between 5 and 10 million.)

To be sure, the foreign press was largely forbidden to investigate rumors of the famine and genocide now referred to as the Holodomor, Ukrainian for "to kill by starvation." But two British correspondents based in Moscow, Gareth Jones and Malcolm Muggeridge of the Manchester Guardian, and the American journalist William Henry Chamberlain of the Christian Science Monitor, did manage to travel in the Ukrainian countryside and report on their findings from outside the Soviet Union.

This appears to have enraged Duranty who, while acknowledging the severity of Stalin's methods, denied accusations of famine and blamed Jones's reporting, in particular, on diplomatic conflicts between the Kremlin and the British government. In a March 1933 story with a headline both comic and cruel ("Russians Hungry, But Not Starving") Duranty complained about British sources for "a big scare story in the American press about famine in the Soviet Union" and assured Times readers that "any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda."

Duranty's authority as the veteran Times correspondent in the Soviet capital, and his recent Pulitzer Prize, served to settle the matter for, among others, the editors of The Nation, who praised his reporting as "the most enlightened, dispassionate dispatches from a great nation in the making which appeared in any newspaper in the world." And there the matter stood until recent decades.

To its credit, the Times didn't flinch when, three-quarters of a century later, Mark von Hagen concluded that Walter Duranty had effectively fallen "under Stalin's spell" during his tenure in Moscow and, in suitably dispassionate language, condemned Duranty's "uncritical acceptance of the Soviet self-justification for its cruel and wasteful regime."

In a subsequent interview, von Hagen expressed his opinion that, "for the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the [Pulitzer] Prize away" and that Duranty's award "diminishes the Prize's honor." In a curious postscript, however, the Pulitzer board declined to revoke it. "There was not clear and convincing evidence," explained Pulitzer administrator Sig Gissler, "of deliberate deception."
Philip Terzian, a former writer and editor at The Weekly Standard, is the author of Architects of Power: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and the American Century.

Texto completo: President Trump told a group of people that the individual who provided the whistleblower with information is “close to a spy” and alluded to the “old days” when punishment for spying was handled differently.
Speaking Thursday morning to a group of staff from the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, Trump condemned Joe Biden’s role in Ukraine while he was vice president and fumed over the identity of the person who told the whistleblower about a July 25 call between him and the Ukrainian president, according to the New York Times.
“I want to know who’s the person who gave the whistleblower the information because that’s close to a spy,” Trump said. “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.”
The remark reportedly stunned people in the audience and comes the same day that acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testified before the House Intelligence Committee about the August whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump improperly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden.

Texto completo: Un agente de la CIA que laboró durante un tiempo en la Casa Blanca sería el informante que alertó sobre la petición del presidente Donald Trump a su homólogo ucraniano para investigar al exvicepresidente Joe Biden .
The New York Times afirma que corroboró la identidad de esa personas con tres fuentes distintas, además de señalar que es posible que el agente tenga un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana.
El denunciante presentó una queja que fue enviada al Comité de Inteligencia de la Cámara de Representantes para alegar un encubrimiento de la Casa Blanca de la llamada telefónica de julio en la que el presidente Trump solicitó al presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky que abriera una investigación sobre Hunter Biden , hijo del exvicepresidente aspirante a la candidatura presidencial de su partido.
El diario defiende la decisión de publicar la información sobre el denunciante, argumentando que el contexto de su posición y su experiencia le da credibilidad a su queja, sobre la cual este jueves compareció el director interino de Inteligencia Nacional, Joseph Maguire , quien dijo desconocer la identidad del informante.
La denuncia — que fue dada a conocer este jueves — advierte que la llamada del mandatario republicano al presidente ucraniano Zelensky también intentó ser ocultada por personal no identificado de la Casa Blanca.
“En el curso de mis deberes oficiales, he recibido información de varios funcionarios del gobierno de EEUU de que el presidente de los Estados Unidos está utilizando el poder de su oficina para solicitar la interferencia de un país extranjero (sic) en las elecciones estadounidenses de 2020” , escribió el denunciante en la queja con fecha del 12 de agosto sobre la llamada de julio. “Esta interferencia incluye, entre otras cosas, presionar a un país extranjero (sic) para que investigue a uno de los principales rivales políticos internos del presidente”.

A reluctant, but stalwart hero of the Brett Kavanaugh saga

Texto completo: Every good story needs a hero, and the saga of Brett Kavanaugh’s rise to the Supreme Court has provided one: Leland Keyser.
She also became a victim when her longtime friend, Christine Blasey Ford, decided to hit refresh on a decades-old high school incident that apparently only Ford remembers.
Keyser is the other female student whom Ford named as having been at the small party where Kavanaugh allegedly pinned her down on a bed and groped her. She is also the friend who swore under penalty of perjury that she doesn’t recall such a party or, in fact, ever having met Kavanaugh. Her comments echoed those of the other partygoers Ford named, none of whom remembered such a gathering.
This isn’t what places Keyser on the heroes’ roster. What earns her that distinction is her steadfastness, at great personal suffering, in refusing to change her story despite what she describes as pressure to she rethink her initial statement. According to a new book, "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh" by New York Times reporters Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebin, some of Keyser’s erstwhile friends and acquaintances tried to persuade her to say she didn’t remember the party, not that it didn’t happen.
Keyser, reportedly a registered Democrat, has become increasingly convinced that Ford’s story isn’t true and doesn’t make sense, according to the book.
According to the book, Ford’s team of friends and advisers apparently saw Keyser as an obstacle to Ford’s narrative and brainstormed ways for her to get onboard. The book cites a group text among Ford’s acquaintances from soon after her testimony. Cheryl Amitay, who attended the same girls’ high school as Ford, wrote: "Maybe one of you guys who are friends with [Keyser] can have a heart-to-heart."
A man who had gone to a neighboring boys’ school chimed in: "Perhaps it makes sense to let everyone in the public know what her condition is." To which Amitay responded, "Leland is a major stumbling block."
Keyser, a former professional golfer who has undergone numerous operations on her back and neck, has suffered addiction during her adult life. Although recovering, she told Kelly and Pogrebin she was concerned that this history would be used against her if she didn’t come up with a more-acceptable recollection of events. When pressed, however, she refused to take the easy route and protect herself.
For her integrity and valor under perceived pressure, she has been punished. Even Ford seemed to turn on her old friend, mentioning Keyser’s "significant health challenges," during her testimony, and seeming to suggest that her friend might have diminished capacities: "I’m happy that she’s focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs."
This may have been one of the sweetest condemnations in the history of tossing inconvenient friends under the bus. But, importantly, Ford planted a seed of doubt about Keyser’s credibility, which has been cultivated by the Times writers. On CNN’s "Reliable Sources" Sunday, Kelly pointed to Keyser’s "memory issues ... because she has a history of substance abuse, which she acknowledges."
Oof. What a gut punch. If no one in recovery can ever be trusted again, then the world of rehabilitative addiction therapy may as well shutter its doors.
In fact, Keyser remembers very well the summer of 1982, when Ford believes the alleged incident occurred. It was the year after her grandmother introduced her to golf and Keyser became consumed with the sport, according to another book published this past summer, "Justice on Trial," by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Keyser worked full-time in the golf pro shop at a Washington-area country club and had little time for socializing. Her hard work at school and in sports paid off with stellar grades, seven varsity letters, and acceptance to the University of Virginia, followed by a professional golfing career and a coaching position at Georgetown University.
Today, Keyser keeps a low profile, as was always her preference. She is, indeed, in fragile health from her injuries and surgeries. But Keyser can stand tall for having remained true to her convictions despite being exposed and pressured by those who seemed to have used her struggles against her. In my book, that’s heroic.

Texto completo: Here's why we are not simply calling it a transcript.
The document released by the White House recounting Mr. Trump's conversation with Mr. Zelensky might look like a transcript, but it is marked, "Memorandum of Telephone Conversation," and it warns that it is not a verbatim account. Instead, it was "developed with assistance from voice recognition software along with experts and note takers listening." Because The New York Times cannot know what exactly was said, we have chosen to call the document a reconstructed transcript.
What did the whistle-blower claim?
The complaint's full details remain a mystery, as does the whistle-blower's identity. Because Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have openly acknowledged pressuring Ukraine about corruption and the Bidens, it is not clear how much of the complaint involves information that is not already in plain view. But in a closed-door briefing with lawmakers, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, suggested that the matter goes beyond Mr. Trump's July phone call.
The Trump-appointed inspector general still found the information credible.
A memo from the Office of Legal Counsel stresses that the whistle-blower received secondhand the information about Mr. Trump's "confidential diplomatic communication." (As noted, the complaint apparently refers to more events than just this phone call.) It also says that the inspector general, Michael Atkinson, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, noted something that suggested the whistle-blower did not support the re-election of Mr. Trump. Nevertheless, Mr. Atkinson found the information credible.
What happens next? The next moves belong to Congress.
"The process will come," said Representative Madeleine Dean, Democrat of Pennsylvania, but other lawmakers said the House needed to set a course. Leaders do not plan to cancel a scheduled two-week recess that begins on Friday, but said that the judiciary and intelligence committees would remain active. There was also already disagreement about the breadth of the case the House should build. Ms. Pelosi's instructions to the six committees suggested that she was envisioning articles of impeachment beyond just the president's dealings with Ukraine.

Texto completo: ProPublica Illinois is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism with moral force. Sign up for our newsletter to get weekly updates written by our journalists.
Early last year, we asked ProPublica Illinois readers what they wanted to know about how we do our work. Thoughtful, challenging questions have been rolling in ever since, and we’ve been answering them in an occasional series of columns. In this column, reporting fellow Lakeidra Chavis writes about the books, articles and movies that have inspired the journalists in our newsroom.
Would you recommend any specific books and/or other sources to an interested person who is not in a position to attend journalism school? —David Weinkrantz
I didn’t major in journalism, but the pieces that have influenced me the most are often stories with captivating sagas that take me to a place or time I know little about — New Yorker articles like “The Marriage Cure” or “The Assad Files,” or Esquire’s “The Falling Man.” These stories are deeply humanizing and thoroughly reported.
I threw your question out to my colleagues, too. Here are some books and other resources they recommend:
“Telling True Stories: A Nonfiction Writers’ Guide From the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University”
Editor-in-Chief Louise Kiernan says this is the book she recommends more than any other to aspiring and practicing journalists.
“It’s 12 years old now, so it’s dated in some respects. But for hearing renowned reporters and editors talk directly about their work, from conception to publication and beyond, it’s invaluable,” Kiernan said. “Generally, though, I think the best way to learn about good journalism is just to read good journalism.”
“Why Should I Tell You?: A Guide to Less-Extractive Reporting” by Natalie Yahr
Engagement reporter Logan Jaffe recommends this online resource, saying it “should be required reading for every journalist.” The guide, written by Natalie Yahr, a fellow at the University of Wisconsin’s Center for Journalism Ethics, includes 12 rules to help make journalism more mutually beneficial for both the reporter and the people they interview. The guidebook touches on everything from how reporters can properly communicate what sources can expect during and after an interview to creating boundaries and making the editorial process more inclusive.
“With this guide, I aim to help journalists navigate the ethical dilemmas they encounter as they interview people who have experienced harm,” Yahr writes. “While there are numerous practical guides on such interviewing, especially on trauma journalism, I have yet to find a guide that explores the deeper ethical questions of what conditions, if any, make such journalism morally justifiable and not purely extractive or voyeuristic.”
Jaffe also recommends the Pulitzer Prize-winning article “A Most American Terrorist: The Making of Dylann Roof” by Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah in GQ , which she said was one of her “favorite examples of narrative, investigative reporting that embraces the writer’s point of view,” and “Communities of Journalism: A History of American Newspapers and Their Readers” by David Paul Nord . She said the book is a “bit dated” but nevertheless a “very thorough history of newspaper/reader relationships.”
“She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement” by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey
Reporter Melissa Sanchez recommends this investigation of film producer Harvey Weinstein that became a pivotal moment of the #MeToo era. Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, both of The New York Times, lit the fire with their expose in October 2017 detailing how Weinstein sexually harassed and allegedly sexually assaulted women in Hollywood for decades. The book, which came out this month, details how they did it and the impact their investigation has had on the country.
Sanchez also recommends “Travels with Herodotus” by Ryszard Kapuściński . Sanchez, who dreamed of becoming a foreign correspondent when she was younger, says she was “deeply influenced” by this memoir. The Polish journalist worked for decades reporting in places such as India, Iran and Congo. The book is intertwined with excerpts from the works of ancient Greek historian Herodotus.
“Though I never became a full-fledged correspondent — there are fewer and fewer of these jobs each year as news organizations slash jobs, and my own goals changed — I did get to spend some time in Latin America reporting a handful of stories,” Sanchez said. “The excitement and wonder of doing this kind of work probably grows old for some people, but I still feel giddy when I think of the prospect, and re-read books like his”
“Boss” by Mike Royko
This book by the legendary columnist is a Chicago journalism staple, and it’s one that deputy editor Steve Mills received early in his career and continues to recommend to friends.
“With ‘Boss,’” Mills said, “Royko gave me — then new to Chicago and still learning its political history — an unvarnished education in the first Mayor Daley and in how things really work in the city, the kind of education you get after spending decades observing people like the mayor. And it was fun to read. What more could you want?”
Mills also suggests “The Corpse Had a Familiar Face,” from former Miami Herald crime reporter Edna Buchanan. The book details her nearly two decades covering stories on the beat.
“Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why it Matters Now” by Alan Rusbridger
Newspapers around the country have been shrinking or, in some cases, closing. Alan Rusbridger, the former editor of The Guardian, explores what this means for democracy and the news industry. It’s a recommendation from reporter Jason Grotto.
“Anyone interested in journalism should consider the newspaper industry’s recent trajectory as well as the core values undergirding it,” Grotto said. “Knowing how and why newspapering has changed will provide great insights to those wanting to learn more about journalism in the larger sense. Rusbridger’s story brings both of those things together, the history and the values.”
And if movies are more of your thing …
ProPublica Illinois story producer Vignesh Ramachandran recommends the Oscar-winning film “Spotlight.” The movie is based on the true story of how The Boston Globe’s investigative team uncovered widespread child sex abuse within the Catholic Church.
“The part that was so powerful to me was seeing the reporters and editors work so hard to build a larger systemic story about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church — the hours and hours spent combing through paper records (things we’re now sometimes lucky enough to do digitally today),” Ramachandran said. “They didn’t settle until they could pull multiple pieces together and tell a wider systemic story that was even more powerful than it would have been.”
A nonjournalism source that a couple of folks recommended was Stephen King’s “On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft,” which documents his journey to becoming one of America’s most prolific writers.

ON IMPEACHMENT, DOYLE GETS WISH; LAMB WAITS TO SEE

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rep. Mike Doyle got a monthslong wish granted on Tuesday when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump.
Hours before Ms. Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House would act because Mr. Trump had "seriously violated the Constitution," Mr. Doyle, a Democrat from Forest Hills, repeated his call for an impeachment inquiry of the president.
Mr. Trump is accused of pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading Democratic challenger in the upcoming 2020 presidential election. The alleged misconduct - the subject of a whistleblower complaint that surfaced last week - is "mind-boggling," Mr. Doyle wrote.
"That the president of the United States would withhold Congressionally directed funds to an ally in need, in order to compel it to smear a political rival, seems to amount to blatant extortion for personal political gain," Mr. Doyle wrote. Mr. Trump has acknowledged raising Mr. Biden's name in his conversation with the Ukranian president but denied that it was tied to withholding funds.
Another Pittsburgh-area Democrat had a different take: Wait and see.
Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, said he will withhold his support for an impeachment inquiry until he gets more evidence.
Reached on Tuesday after the impeachment inquiry was announced, Mr. Lamb referred to a statement in which he called on the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, to release all of the information regarding the complaint.
"As I said yesterday, we need to get the full text of the whistleblower complaint by Thursday, not just the transcript of one phone call," Mr. Lamb said in a statement provided by his office.
"It appears that we will learn more facts in the coming days, and I'll have more to say after that," he said.
Mr. Doyle said Congress has an obligation to investigate the president if there is evidence that he has broken the law while conducting foreign affairs. Withholding information from Congress, he added, is part of a pattern of behavior that must end.
The White House has sparred with House Democrats as they have investigated Russian interference in the 2016 elections.
"I have been frustrated and angry that the Trump administration has stonewalled Congress and refused to comply with valid subpoenas as we have exercised our Constitutional oversight responsibilities," Mr. Doyle stated, referring to the Russia investigations.
"I believe that the recent allegations only add to the urgency of a full and immediate impeachment inquiry," he said. "If the latest allegations are accurate, that would be a gross misuse of the powers of his office on a number of levels and, in my opinion, an impeachable offense."
Mr. Lamb, a freshman in the House, has faced pressure recently from some of his progressive constituents to go beyond simply condemning the president.
Mr. Lamb has explained he supports the numerous investigations lodged by several committees in the Democrat-controlled House but would not endorse impeachment. At an Aug. 20 town hall meeting in Hampton, citing his experience as a federal prosecutor, he called impeachment a "high bar" requiring a "mountain of evidence."
It is unclear whether the Ukraine revelations last week rise to that level.
On Monday, following the revelations, Mr. Lamb released a statement that criticized Mr. Maguire for failing to comply with federal whistleblower law. He demanded the administration turn over all information regarding the complaint to the House Intelligence Committee by Thursday.
"We cannot allow even the possibility to exist that our president used the immense power of that office to protect his own selfish interests, rather than to protect the American people," Mr. Lamb stated.
"The safety and security of all Americans is at stake in Ukraine and anywhere that our adversaries threaten the cause of freedom," he added. "As lawmakers, we swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. We will get the truth."
On the Republican side, Pennsylvania congressmen Guy Reschenthaler, of Peters, and John Joyce, of Blair County, criticized the move to begin impeachment proceedings.
"This is a sad day for our democracy. Speaker Pelosi's decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry based on secondhand allegations shows just how desperate the Democrats are to undo the will of the American people. President Trump has agreed to release the unredacted transcript of his phone call with the president of Ukraine and the House Intelligence Committee has yet to hold any hearings on this matter," Mr. Reschenthaler's statement said. "Calling for impeachment before learning the facts sets a dangerous precedent and shows that once again, House Democrats are putting political theatre before the needs of the American people."
"Time and again, House Democrats have proven that they prioritize endless investigations over meaningful legislation - always to the detriment of the American people," Mr. Joyce said in his statement.

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani is philosophical about the fact that getting attention for an issue he cares about means also getting attention himself — usually unwanted.
That’s certainly the case as Giuliani, President Trump’s personal lawyer, makes headlines every day for urging Ukraine’s government to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for possible corruption in the country.
President Barack Obama made his vice president, the elder Biden, the point man on Ukraine policy, and shortly thereafter, the younger Biden secured a $50,000-a-month consulting gig with the country’s largest private gas company despite having no experience in Ukraine or energy. Biden went to Kyiv in 2016 and demanded that Ukraine oust its top prosecutor or give up $1 billion in U.S. aid, and Ukraine obliged. The prosecutor was allegedly looking into that gas company, Burisma Holdings, and the oligarch who ran it.
As Giuliani, 75, puts the Democratic front-runner to challenge Trump for the presidency in 2020 under the microscope, some are doing the same to the onetime Republican presidential hopeful. The New York Times recently called Giuliani’s divorce from his third wife, the former Judith Nathan, “nasty” and “operatic.”
“What relevance does my divorce have to anything in the world but me, my wife?” Giuliani said to the Washington Examiner. “We have no children together. So, the relevance is only to the two of us.”
The former mayor of New York City was speaking in Manhattan across the street from the United Nations, where he gave a speech to a rally of thousands of Iranian Americans supporting regime change in Iran by Iranians.
“You can make your own conclusion,” he said in answer to a question about why his divorce was now newspaper fodder. “I don't comment on it except to say: So, don't you have your own lives?”
He continued, “I also found that most people don't pay much attention to it. It’s a one-day story. Everybody enjoys gossip a little bit. You have to take, with the good of being a public official or public figure, having some ability to influence opinion, you have to take with it, you're going to get a lot of criticism. I can't say it doesn't bother me at all, but it stopped really bothering me a long time ago.”
He pauses and reflects on his second marriage, whose end he announced in 2000, when he was mayor.
“I went through another divorce, and I did have children, and that broke my heart,” he said. “Luckily, that's taken care of. My children and I are very close. And I'm going to tell you one of the people that helped me with that: the president of United States, Donald J. Trump.”
Trump was a real estate mogul in New York then.
“He became very close with my son. He played golf with him all the time,” Giuliani said. Andrew Giuliani is now 32. The former mayor also has a daughter, Caroline, 30.
“Donald J. Trump, who all the Democrats demonize, is probably one of the two or three people who most effectively and very adult way counseled my son and got him to see that when there is a split-up like this in a marriage, it’s not about the children, it's about something going on between the two adults, and it's not their fault,” Giuliani said. “The biggest issue in a divorce is: Are the children going to blame it on themselves? Well, he helped me, and so did people close to my former wife, helped my children understand that’s not the case. Right now, we both have a very close relationship with him. We were both at Andrew’s wedding. So, I'm very happy.”
Media reports in 2000 said the Giuliani divorce had estranged the children from their father. They’re not anymore. Andrew lives in Washington, working as the White House public liaison assistant. “But since I’m in Washington all the time, I get to see him all the time. And he's a fabulous golfer. Andrew's a very good golfer. He was a professional. He played about three or four years in Europe,” Giuliani said.
When asked who wins when Andrew and the president play, Giuliani said, “I never announce the president’s golf scores. I can tell you one thing: The president beats me. But I’m not a good golfer. I'm just OK. I’m enthusiastic.”

Texto completo: It always amazes me when I read comments critical of our news media, especially the New York Times and Washington Post, for their leanings toward the left. The truth is the mainstream media very seldom gives voice to leftist views or even covers leftist actions. The mainstream media actually reflects the thinking of the status quo.
So if conservatives think that status quo is left and the left thinks that status quo is conservative, maybe labels have become obsolete, and we should just expect news to be presented objectively with equal representation of differing sources or opinions.

We all need to change I am horrified by the burning of the Amazon rain forest. The people clear land by fire to make a living on cattle and palm oil. The fire gets out of control and destroys trees and ecosystems resulting in loss of soil by erosion, loss of habitat for people and wildlife and increase in CO2 across the planet.
I am horrified but is this any different than what we did and are doing to our land, water and air here in Iowa and across America with industrial agriculture and CAFOs?
It is different in that the Amazon fire is fast — s while the destruction of our land, lakes, rivers and the Gulf of Mexico is slow — over 100 years through use of chemicals, no rotation of crops, and loss of filter strips.
It is not different as the reason for both is that people are trying to make a living. It is not different as the end result for both is the same: destruction of the land, water, and air.
We are all horrified. We are all guilty. We all need to change. The first step is learning. Come watch and listen to the movie Right to Harm and guest panelists at Iowa City Public Library on Oct. 14, at 6:30 p.m.
Start changing to save ourselves and our precious resources.

Advocate for groundbreaking energy resolution How promising it is that the vital issue of climate change is at the forefront of American awareness. Recently we have heard the many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates debate their climate change policies. Many leaders, innovators, and businesses in the U.S. still stay committed to the Paris Climate Agreement with almost 200 other nations even if President Trump withdrew in 2017. But sitting in the House of Representatives is a resolution that could help put the U.S. on a path towards zero carbon emissions and millions of new jobs within decades. The H.R. 763, Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, was a bipartisan bill introduced in the House in 2019.
Research shows that the H.R. 763 would halt emissions through a carbon tax and allocate the funds back to American families to invest in clean energy and lowering emissions. The dividends could amount to hundreds of dollars to each family per year, create millions of jobs, and help increase health and quality of life for millions in the U.S. and around the globe. Call your U.S. representative and senators today to advocate for support of this groundbreaking resolution.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U.S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have."
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue." He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner."
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum."
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it."
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance."
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that's a quid-pro-quo." She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Ukraine Goes for Elizabeth Warren

Texto completo: Here's a case of political spin that could only have been delivered tongue in cheek: "Reputable news organizations have concluded there's nothing here," a Joe Biden aide explained to Politico amid this week's bizarre Ukraine eruption.
Except it was two news organizations liberals revere, the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, that did the most to expose the Biden-Ukraine imbroglio that Tuesday set off a new and apparently more serious Trump impeachment drama. Joe Biden was an Obama point man on Ukraine and he may have had perfectly legitimate reasons for demanding Kiev sack an allegedly corrupt prosecutor who was threatening to investigate an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas company. But the fact that his son Hunter Biden, with no visible qualification, was quickly hired to sit on the company's board was obviously a straight-up cronyist play to encourage the desired outcome.
Nobody on either side of the aisle seriously claims otherwise now. "There is little question that Hunter's proximity to power shaped the arc of his career," reported the New Yorker in its 5,000-word piece this summer.
Was there anything illegal here? Probably not. Is such trading on political celebrity a common shortcut to riches for people with otherwise little to offer? Yes.
But here's where it gets interesting. The aesthetic that animated the Trump 2016 campaign now is the aesthetic of the Elizabeth Warren campaign: The game is rigged for the connected, for insiders.
The Joe Biden aesthetic is the anti-disruption aesthetic: Let's go back to before Nov. 8, 2016. There was nothing terribly wrong in the Obama political economy. The Trump experiment was the wrong turn. We don't need a big left turn to fix it.
Guess which aesthetic Mr. Trump wishes to run against? As he recently told voters in New Hampshire, "Whether you love me or hate me you have to vote for me" to keep the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrats out of power.
Mr. Trump is something new under the sun in our politics, but not because he is untruthful, cynical, hypocritical or self-interested.
Those qualities at least he shares with a sizable cross-section of the political class or else he wouldn't be president now. See how easily he has conjured from his opponents a mirror image of himself: lying, peddling conspiracy theories, compelling themselves to believe 12 unsubstantiated things before lunch. The establishment keeps trying to defeat Mr. Trump by validating the critique of the establishment that got Mr. Trump elected in the first place.
Now they're at it again. The national press, in advance of crucial facts, has decided that Mr. Trump's behavior on the phone with Ukraine's new president wasn't merely foolish and discreditable (as it likely was). It was impeachable based on the full-monty presumption that Mr. Trump not only urged Ukraine's new president to investigate the Bidens, but also threatened to withhold U.S. military aid if he didn't.
Even if true, such a threat is likely not illegal under the Constitution. A president is granted broad powers to conduct foreign relations, with the electorate being the ultimate check. Yet on cable TV a pundit horde keens around the clock for Mr. Trump to be removed by means other than the ballot box.
Mr. Trump may not be so crazy to think voters, even now, will care less about the latest accusations against him than about a lucrative foreign sinecure landing in Hunter Biden's lap because his father was vice president. In a little-r republican sense, voters wouldn't necessarily be wrong to do so. Voters aren't expected to know what to do about Ukraine but they are supposed to experience qualms when waking up and discovering their elected leaders' kin are profiteering from Ukraine policy (a concern that Democrats haven't been shy about promoting against Mr. Trump and his family).
While I have my doubts, many Republicans believe an even greater transforming jolt is coming when details are revealed in coming weeks about the FBI's and CIA's roles in promoting the previous theory of Trump criminal collusion with Russia. I suspect most Americans already know where they stand on that.
This may be the week that gives us an election that won't be the up-or-down vote on Mr. Trump's fitness that Mr. Biden offers. It will be the election that Mr. Trump wants (and Ms. Warren presumably is prepared to supply), the reprobate vs. the intolerable left-wing agenda. That's because a House inquiry into Mr. Trump's Ukraine call can only mean a re-airing of Mr. Biden's Ukraine laundry too.
Which is quite a trick for the man who began as the chaos candidate. Then again, much of the credit belongs to his opponents. If Democrats and the media mean what they say about Mr. Trump's special iniquity, they wouldn't be using his existence as a bet-the-farm opportunity to squeak into office a policy agenda they normally would hide from the American people around election time.

Trump responds to climate activist Thunberg in sarcastic tweet

Texto completo: President Trump responded to an impassioned plea to global leaders at the United Nations by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg with a sarcastic late-night tweet.
"She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!" Trump said on Twitter shortly after 11:30 p.m. on Monday.
He attached a news account of Thunberg's remarks to the gathering in New York earlier in the day that highlighted a deeply pessimistic quote: "People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth."
Appearing on a panel at the UN climate summit, Thunberg chastised leaders for praising young activists like herself while failing to deliver on drastic actions needed to avert the worst effects of climate change, and she warned that if the world continued with business as usual, her generation would face an insurmountable catastrophe.
"This is all wrong," said Thunberg who, with tears in her eyes and her face flushed, was visibly emotional as she spoke.
Cameras caught Thunberg giving Trump an icy stare as he arrived at the UN gathering earlier in the day.
Trump, who in the past has called climate change a "hoax," gave scant attention to the issue that dominated the day on Monday.
After scheduling one of his administration's marquee events — a forum on religious freedom — during the UN climate summit on Monday, he dropped by the climate event for 14 minutes in a surprise visit. He did not speak and left after listening to remarks from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Angela Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor.
Meanwhile, Fox News has apologized for a guest's "disgraceful" description of Thunberg as mentally ill but was silent Tuesday on Laura Ingraham likening her to a murderous cult of children from a Stephen King story.
The network responded swiftly to a news segment Monday where Michael Knowles of "The Daily Wire" said the 16-year-old environmentalist was a "mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left."
Thunberg has been open about being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, embracing it as her "superpower."
Knowles was immediately called out by a fellow guest, podcast host Chris Hahn, who said, "You're a grown man and you've attacked a child. Shame on you."
Hahn called on Knowles to immediately apologize. He didn't and won't get a chance again on Fox. The network later apologized to Thunberg and viewers for the comment and said it had no plans to book Knowles, who has no tie to the network, again.
A couple hours later Ingraham, one of the network's prime-time stars, said she found some of Thunberg's remarks before the United Nations that scolded officials for not acting on climate change to be chilling. She juxtaposed a portion of the speech with a clip from the 1984 horror film "Children of the Corn."

Times says it asked Ireland to rescue reporter
NEW YORK — The New York Times said it turned to the Irish government to rescue a reporter threatened with arrest in Egypt two years ago out of concern that the Trump administration wouldn't help.
Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed the incident during a speech at Brown University and in an op-ed published Tuesday. He criticized President Trump for seeding a "worldwide assault on journalists and journalism" and said it's time for the United States to again champion the rights of a free press.
There was no immediate response from the White House.
In August 2017, the Times was contacted by a US government official who warned that Declan Walsh, a reporter based in Egypt, was going to be arrested, Sulzberger said. The Times magazine had just published Walsh's story about Giulio Regini, an Italian student found dead in Cairo and the subject of a dispute between Italy and Egypt about whether the Egyptian government was involved.
The US official who contacted the Times operated on the belief that the Trump administration would sit on the information and not help the reporter, Sulzberger said. The official feared being punished for alerting the Times.
Walsh, who is an Irish citizen, tweeted that he called the US government press office in Cairo upon getting the warning and was directed to the Irish embassy. Within an hour, an Irish diplomat drove him to the airport and Walsh left for Europe. He has since returned to work in Egypt.
"I owe a belated thanks to (an) Irish diplomat who rushed to help in a tight spot," Walsh said. "He was cool, swift and fearless." He said he was also grateful to the Washington tipster.
Sulzberger said that 18 months later, Times reporter David Kirkpatrick was detained and deported in apparent retaliation for reporting information that embarrassed the Egyptian government.
When the Times protested, an official at the US embassy said, "What did you expect would happen to him? His reporting made the government look bad."
For years, when sending reporters into dangerous situations, the Times always felt that the US government, "the world's greatest champion of the free press," would have its back, the publisher said.
Now, the paper sees how Trump's favorite descriptor of stories he doesn't like, "fake news," has spread to governments beyond the United States, he said.

Texto completo: Just as the aftershocks of the special counsel's Russia investigation seemed to have settled, the latest tremblor out of the Oval Office is whether the president used the levers of his foreign policy toward Ukraine for political gain.
A confidential whistleblower report might provide an answer. But once again, the nation's grinding democratic processes are falling short of providing Americans what they need to decide whether Donald Trump did something wrong.
Short of someone violating the law by leaking that whistleblower complaint, or the whistleblower risking retaliation by bravely going to Congress, there's no quick or certain process for the public to learn its contents.
There is, however, a steady drip of news media reports, and a few admissions by Trump himself on Sunday.
According to The Washington Post and The New York Times, a whistleblower complaint filed with the intelligence community's inspector general focused on a promise Trump made during a phone call on July 25 with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. (This happened to be the day after Robert Mueller's much-anticipated congressional testimony.)
During that conversation, Trump asked the Kiev leader to investigate a key political opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Biden's son Hunter, regarding the younger Biden's past business dealings in Ukraine. The Wall Street Journal later buttressed this reporting, revealing that Trump pressed Zelensky about eight times during their call to open the inquiry. Still unclear is whether there's any connection between Trump's desire for an investigation of the Bidens and $250 million in U.S. military aid for Ukraine, which has been engaged in a five-year civil war with pro-Russian separatists. The aid was inexplicably delayed, then released a day after Congress raised concerns about the whistleblower complaint.
A system of checks and balances guaranteed by the Constitution should inform the American people when their president violates the law or commits an impeachable offense. That system is being stretched to the breaking point.
Now it's up to members of Congress to get to the bottom of this latest tawdry tale by holding hearings, obtaining transcripts, and finding a way to gain access to the whistleblower complaint or that person's testimony.

Ukraine Goes for Elizabeth Warren; The latest Trump scandal is more likely to eliminate Joe Biden than the president.

Texto completo: Here's a case of political spin that could only have been delivered tongue in cheek: "Reputable news organizations have concluded there's nothing here," a Joe Biden aide explained to Politico amid this week's bizarre Ukraine eruption.
Except it was two news organizations liberals revere, the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, that did the most to expose the Biden-Ukraine imbroglio that Tuesday set off a new and apparently more serious Trump impeachment drama. Joe Biden was an Obama point man on Ukraine and may have had perfectly legitimate reasons for demanding Kiev sack an allegedly corrupt prosecutor who was threatening to investigate an allegedly corrupt Ukrainian gas company. But the fact that his son Hunter Biden, with no visible qualification, had been hired to sit on the company's board was obviously a straight-up cronyist play to encourage the desired outcome.
Nobody on either side of the aisle seriously claims otherwise now. "There is little question that Hunter's proximity to power shaped the arc of his career," reported the New Yorker in its 5,000-word piece this summer.
Was there anything illegal here? Probably not. Is such trading on political celebrity a common shortcut to riches for people with otherwise little to offer? Yes.
But here's where it gets interesting. The aesthetic that animated the Trump 2016 campaign now is the aesthetic of the Elizabeth Warren campaign: The game is rigged for the connected, for insiders.
The Joe Biden aesthetic is the anti-disruption aesthetic: Let's go back to before Nov. 8, 2016. There was nothing terribly wrong in the Obama political economy. The Trump experiment was the wrong turn. We don't need a big left turn to fix it.
Guess which aesthetic Mr. Trump wishes to run against? As he recently told voters in New Hampshire, "Whether you love me or hate me you have to vote for me" to keep the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrats out of power.
Mr. Trump is something new under the sun in our politics, but not because he is untruthful, cynical, hypocritical or self-interested.
Those qualities at least he shares with a sizable cross-section of the political class or else he wouldn't be president now. See how easily he has conjured from his opponents a mirror image of himself: lying, peddling conspiracy theories, compelling themselves to believe 12 unsubstantiated things before lunch. The establishment keeps trying to defeat Mr. Trump by validating the critique of the establishment that got Mr. Trump elected in the first place.
Now they're at it again. The national press, in advance of crucial facts, has decided that Mr. Trump's behavior on the phone with Ukraine's new president wasn't merely foolish and discreditable (as it likely was). It was impeachable based on the full-monty presumption that Mr. Trump not only urged Ukraine's new president to investigate the Bidens, but also threatened to withhold U.S. military aid if he didn't.
Even if true, such a threat is likely not illegal under the Constitution. A president is granted broad powers to conduct foreign relations, with the electorate being the ultimate check. Yet on cable TV a pundit horde has been keening around the clock for Mr. Trump to be removed by means other than the ballot box.
Mr. Trump may not be crazy to think voters, even now, will care less about the latest accusations against him than about a lucrative foreign sinecure landing in Hunter Biden's lap because his father was vice president. In a little-r republican sense, voters wouldn't necessarily be wrong to do so. Voters aren't expected to know what to do about Ukraine but they are supposed to experience qualms when waking up and discovering their elected leaders' kin are profiteering from Ukraine policy (a concern that Democrats haven't been shy about promoting against Mr. Trump and his family).
While I have my doubts, many Republicans believe an even greater transforming jolt is coming when details are revealed in coming weeks about the FBI's and CIA's roles in promoting the previous theory of Trump criminal collusion with Russia. I suspect most Americans already know where they stand on that.
This may be the week that gives us an election that won't be the up-or-down vote on Mr. Trump's fitness that Mr. Biden offers. It will be the election that Mr. Trump wants (and Ms. Warren presumably is prepared to supply), the reprobate vs. the intolerable left-wing agenda. That's because a House inquiry into Mr. Trump's Ukraine call can only mean a re-airing of Mr. Biden's Ukraine laundry too.
Which is quite a trick for the man who began as the chaos candidate. Then again, much of the credit belongs to his opponents. If Democrats and the media really mean what they say about Mr. Trump's special iniquity, they wouldn't be using his existence as a bet-the-farm opportunity to squeak into office a policy agenda they normally would hide from the American people around election time.

Texto completo: In the Trump era, a columnist risks appearing like the boy (or girl) who cried wolf. Time and time again, we say this scandal is the big one.
But in our ill-fated version of the story, the wolf comes every time. The violations of morality and law have become progressively bolder and more dangerous to the constitutional order. And they have culminated in an abuse of power both highly serious and totally unconcealed.
By his own admission, the president of the United States urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open a criminal investigation of the son of a political rival. Trump denies that this request involved a quid pro quo. But with Ukraine engaged in conflict with Russian-backed separatists, and with $250 million in American military aid being held up (at the time) for "review," the threat did not need to be explicit in order to be palpable and powerful.
This groundbreaking form of political corruption shocked everyone with a conscience who was privy to it. U.S. embassy staff in Kiev expressed alarm about Rudy Giuliani’s contacts with Ukrainian officials. A whistleblower in the intelligence community risked his or her career to report it. The intelligence community’s inspector general found the matter of "urgent concern." But acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the Department of Justice — playing the role of political enforcers — have blocked the transmission of the whistleblower’s report to Congress. They are pursuing a cover-up in plain sight.
Here we need to be clear. Treating the presidency in this fashion is not only corrupt but unpatriotic. Trump has set his own interests above the interests of the nation. The American criminal justice system was created to deal with normal types of political corruption, not with a rogue president, testing the limits of executive power. That form of warped ambition must be checked and balanced by the coequal branches of government. But many members of Congress — mostly Republicans but also some Democrats — appear to have lost their taste for that role.
The political risk to elected Republicans when they oppose Trump appears very real. But the moral hazard is far greater. When they use their office to shield shady political dealings, they become a party to public corruption. When they ignore or excuse Trump’s use of the nation’s power and influence for private reasons, they have chosen Trump above their country. Worst of all, they are teaching their political supporters that the rule of law is a small and expendable thing.
In the scarier regions of the Trump right, the problem is far advanced. Every revelation of the president’s abuse of power is met with a sentence beginning: "But Biden ..." Their tolerance for corruption seems limitless — and frightening. By what firm political principle would they condemn Trump if he closed down The New York Times (an "enemy of the people") or arrested a few whistleblowers (part of the "deep state" that is conducting a "coup")?
None of this seems possible. But too many impossibilities have recently become realities. Opposing Trump’s corrupt abuse of power — here, now, before it goes further — is the calling of patriotism in our time.

Texto completo: The press minister of the Pakistan Embassy in Washington objects to an Op-Ed article by India's U.S. ambassador. Also: Family-centered child support.
To the Editor:
In "India Is Making Kashmir Stronger" (Op-Ed, Sept. 20), Harsh Vardhan Shringla, India's ambassador to the United States, failed to answer the fundamental question that is bothering all right-thinking people across the globe: Why has India laid siege to Kashmir and cut off eight million Kashmiris from the rest of the world for the last seven weeks?
Instead, he resorted to using India's familiar playbook of pointing the finger at Pakistan, and tarring the Kashmiris' indigenous and legitimate struggle for self-determination with the brush of "terrorism."
Rather than attacking Pakistan and Prime Minister Imran Khan, he should have explained what this "prosperity" is that India feels that it can deliver to the Kashmiris only at the pointed end of bayonets. How does India plan to foster "hope for development" through mass incarceration, torture and cowardly night raids into homes to pick up children?
India appears to be testing a model of economic development on the Kashmiri people, who want none of it, if the deserted marketplaces and more than 700 protests in Kashmir since Aug. 5 are any indication.
Perhaps India should allow international human rights observers and media into Kashmir so that the whole world can learn from its grand experiment of delivering development at gunpoint.

A New Model for Child Support
To the Editor:
Re "Child Support vs. Deadbeat States," by Courtney E. Martin (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Sept. 10):
I write on behalf of the child support directors administering this government program in the 54 states and territories. While the program's focus of prior decades was on retaining child support to recover welfare costs, those days are behind us.
We are now a family-centered program responding to the changing needs of families with a focus on consistent payments so children can count on their parents for the financial and emotional support they need.
Child support is the country's third largest anti-poverty program and collected $ 32 billion in federal fiscal year 2018, with 96 percent of those collections going directly to 14 million children.
Programs around the country are innovating to meet the needs of both parents. For example, 45 states and the District of Columbia have policies to forgive child support debt owed to the state.
Your state child support program is vital to the financial security of families, particularly vulnerable families. Reach out to us.

Texto completo: Newsom says the deaths of 30 horses at Santa Anita Park are a "disgrace." He pledged changes to the board that allowed Triple Crown winner Justify to race despite a failed drug test.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said Monday that horse racing is dangerously close to being out of business in his state and suggested he would curb horse owners and breeders with direct financial interests in the sport from serving on its regulatory board.
With Santa Anita Park returning for its fall season on Friday after 30 horses had to be euthanized on its premises over six months, and on the heels of the revelation that 2018 Triple Crown champion Justify had failed a drug test before the Kentucky Derby that regulators made disappear, Newsom said he was going to appoint a new leader to the regulatory board and hold the group accountable on matters of drugs, safety and integrity.
"What happened last year was unacceptable, and all of the excuses be damned. We own that going into the next season, and we're going to have to do something about it," Newsom said at a meeting with reporters for The New York Times. "I'll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform. That's horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just to spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace."
California racing officials spent four months investigating Justify's failed drug test in the 2018 Santa Anita Derby that should have prevented the horse from starting in the Kentucky Derby. The delay was long enough for Justify to not only compete in the Derby, but also win it, along with the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.
After the Triple Crown winner's breeding rights had been sold for $ 60 million, the California board -- whose chairman at the time, Chuck Winner, had employed Bob Baffert as a trainer -- disposed of the inquiry behind closed doors. It happened in an executive session, an approach the board's executive director had not previously taken during his five-and-a-half-year term.
Winner left the board the day before The Times reported how a lack of transparency kept the failed test from the public. Two other commissioners, including co-chair Madeline Auerbach, own and breed horses with trainers and jockeys that they regulate.
In a letter to The Times released on social media, a lawyer for Baffert, W. Craig Robertson III, said that Justify's positive test for the banned substance scopolamine had been the result of "environmental contamination." The explanation given was that Justify ate jimson weed. Robertson offered no evidence of contamination; neither did California regulators when offered the opportunity to respond.
Scopolamine can be used to help make a horse more efficient by clearing its airway and optimizing its heart rate. Cases involving the substance have resulted in disqualifications, purse reimbursements, fines and suspensions over the decades.
The quantity of the drug found in Justify suggested that it was not the result of feed or bedding contamination and that it was intended to enhance performance, according to Dr. Rick Sams, who ran the drug lab for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission from 2011 to 2018.
Newsom has recently appointed three commissioners with no direct financial ties to the sport and said he will use the same standard for the upcoming appointment of a new chairman.
"We are pulling away from those with direct conflicts and pulling out a more objective oversight capacity," he said.
The Los Angeles district attorney is investigating the deaths at Santa Anita, and the state legislature has held hearings and considered changes to improve how horses are treated and tracks regulated.
Newsom also said the public is far more aware of the abuses and ample death toll in the sport -- 10 horses a week die on American racetracks, according to the Jockey Club, a figure considered conservative because not every race venue reports fatalities during training hours.
"The more you realize what's really going on, the more intolerant you become of certain behaviors," Newsom said. "If you don't reform yourself, you're going to get run over and others are going to reform for you in ways that you don't like."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Republicans appear to be sticking by President Donald Trump despite concerns he sought foreign help to discredit Democratic opponent Joe Biden.
The latest controversy riling up the White House revolves around Trump's contacts with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, a whistleblower complaint at a U. S. intelligence agency and whether Trump conditioned the granting military aid to Ukraine on an investigation into the former Vice President's son, Hunter Biden.
Trump has acknowledged bringing up Biden, the former vice president and leading Democratic 2020 presidential contender, in a July phone call with Zelensky, but he denied offering the aid in exchange for an investigation into Biden.
"I didn't do it," Trump told reporters on Monday in New York at the United Nations General Assembly.
Many Senate Republicans on Monday resisted saying too much about the controversy, dodging questions by reporters and stressing that none of the information about the complaint or the president's conversations has been verified. But others downplayed the issue, saying this was another attempt by Democrats to amplify impeachment efforts. Some also repeated comments that the president himself has made that Biden should be investigated and that's what the media should be focusing on.
"What I really see happening is that Democrats are winding up the outrage machine again," said Sen. John Barrasso, the third highest-ranking Republican in the Senate, adding it's all about "beating the impeachment drum. "
More: What's going on with Trump and Ukraine? And how does it involve Biden and a whistleblower complaint?
More: 'I didn't do it. ' Trump denies he threatened to hold back Ukraine's foreign aid over Biden
"They didn't get what they wanted out of the Mueller investigation," said Barrasso, R-Wyo. "They're hoping they have something here. I just don't see it. "
Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blamed Democrats for choosing to "politicize this issue. " He said their actions are "circumventing the established procedures and protocols that exist so the committees can pursue sensitive matters in the appropriate, deliberate, bipartisan manner. "
McConnell also noted that he personally talked with the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of State to "ensure that Ukraine received this much-needed assistance. "
Sen. Ron Johnson met with Zelensky in Ukraine earlier this month and said before his visit, he talked with Trump on the phone. Johnson said he hoped he could convince Trump to approve of the aid so he could relay that message in person to Zelensky. Trump declined.
"The rationale that he gave [me] is the concern about corruption in Ukraine, which is what I relayed to President Zelensky, and they all acknowledge it. It's why he won the election. They're trying to rid the country of corruption," Johnson said, adding Trump "did not mention anything about Joe Biden or anything" during their phone call.

More: Biden: I never talked to son Hunter about overseas business dealings
Johnson said he didn't believe the whistleblower complaint should be made available to Congress, nor should a transcript of Trump's call with Zelensky. "It's a very dangerous precedent" to start, he said of releasing the call and said it does not appear the complaint is "something necessarily has to have. "
Republicans were divided over whether those materials should be made available to Congress.
Several Republicans expressed unease with the reports about Trump's conversation with Zelensky and stressed the need for more information. Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney said it would be "very serious" if Trump demanded an investigation into Biden and stressed that Congress needs more information on what happened.
Sen. Susan Murkowski, R-Alaska, also said while there aren't facts showing Trump requested an investigation into Biden in exchange for the aid, "it's not OK to make a request that’s a quid-pro-quo. " She said it would be "helpful" having a transcript of the president's call and more information on the whistleblower complaint from the inspector general of the intelligence community.
Both the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire, and the inspector general Michael Atkinson could appear this week before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla. , echoed concerns of president and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, that Biden's conduct should be looked into.
"I think one, we have to get more information about what the President said. And also, we have to get an understanding of exactly what Biden did," Scott said.
The New York Times reported in May that Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U. S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
The prosecutor was accused by U. S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. But Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's current prosecutor, told Bloomberg News Service in May that he had no evidence of wrongdoing by Biden or his son.

Sultan: What will it take to get rid of legacy preference in college admissions?

Texto completo: The email arrived like a temptation.
An invitation seducing me to take part in a questionable game. I quashed my misgivings and filled out the form from my alma mater, noting that I have a child who might apply as a legacy.
Studies have shown what everyone knows to be true: Students who apply to colleges that a family member attended often have a significant unearned advantage over those who don't. It can be used as a tie-breaker when deciding between two well-qualified applicants or it can add additional points to an application. A handful of elite institutions -- MIT, Oxford, Cambridge and University of California-Berkeley -- do not consider legacy as part of admissions, but many of the selective American colleges do.
Legacy preferences were originally designed to favor white, Protestant men at the expense of Jewish, Catholic and immigrant applicants who began scoring higher on entrance exams in greater numbers once they were allowed to apply. And, to this day, studies show that the people who benefit from this boost the most are the ones who need it the least. The New York Times editorial board recently described it as affirmative action for the rich.
Universities defend the practice because they say it increases alumni donations in the long-term and engagement with the institution. It's almost funny to hear universities with billion-dollar-plus endowments defend a system of privilege because it ensures their own wealth. Plus, there is research that disputes that very claim. If Oxford, Cambridge and MIT do not need to rely on legacy preferences to maintain their world-class status, what does that say about Harvard, Yale and all the other elite institutions who feel compelled to hang on to it.
In reality, colleges and universities will not willingly dismantle legacy preferences simply because they know it would upset too many alumni. Some parents believe that their commitment and relationship to an institution merits bonus points for their child. It's unclear why a parent's love or devotion or financial support for anything should translate to her child being entitled to any special consideration for it. In the case of access to higher education, all it does is perpetuate the inequalities built into a rigged system.
Unlike becoming an exceptional athlete or musician or student, being born to parents who attended a particular school required nothing of the student.
I say this while admitting that I was not willing to unilaterally disarm in the current admissions arms race. But if my college or graduate school asked in an alumni survey if I would favor eliminating such consideration entirely from its admissions process, I would support getting rid of it for everyone.
Part of the reason why families might be unlikely to give up this advantage for their children is because of how competitive and unaffordable higher education has become in the past few decades. There's no way I would be accepted to the graduate school I attended under today's admissions standards. And the current costs at these same places would have put them completely out of reach for me back then (even when adjusted for inflation).
Most middle-class families worry about being able to afford college for their children, and higher education is increasingly seen as a prerequisite to surviving in the global economy. The parental anxiety about securing your child's place in the middle class or maintaining a place in the upper class may be too great.
Equality is great in theory -- until it impacts your own privilege.
And, interestingly, the public debate about eliminating legacy preferences is gaining steam at the exact moment when historically under-represented groups might finally benefit from it.
It would be fascinating to see current survey data on how many alumni would support ending legacy preferences at their own institutions. Is there an overlap among those who rally against affirmative action programs yet support legacy preferences?
Don't expect to see colleges asking their alumni these questions anytime soon.
They may not want to hear the answers.

Democrats should look to Yang: We need nuclear power

Texto completo: Want to do something about climate change by reducing carbon emissions? If you're serious, that "something" has to include a massive commitment to the construction of new nuclear power plants worldwide, as well as making sure that existing nuclear power plants don't go offline until they can be replaced by new ones.
Nuclear power is the only major, established, proven source of power that has zero carbon emissions. Of the carbon-free alternatives, only hydroelectric has a long track record as a major power source, and you can only dam so many rivers; solar and wind are still in the teething stages and are unlikely to carry the load any time soon.
Nuclear power is reliable, safe and well understood. If you oppose nuclear power but call climate change a crisis, then you're speaking nonsense, unless you simply want to reduce energy consumption in America to something like what's seen in current day Venezuela, in which case you're just speaking a different kind of nonsense.
Most, but not all, of the Democratic candidates for president are vague on the subject, silent or opposed to nuclear power. But not all. Cory Booker has been a "full-throated" supporter of nuclear power, and nuclear power gets a big boost from Andrew Yang's 2020 climate change plan.
According to Yang's plan, "Nuclear power is a crucial component in the move towards creating sustainable, carbon-free energy for the United States. However, many people – including some other candidates – dismiss it out of hand. Why does it have such a bad reputation? ... First, the public's perception of its safety has been skewed by TV shows like Chernobyl and The Simpsons."
Yang continues: "When the OECD (11), NEA (11), and NASA (12) analyzed the actual danger of nuclear energy compared to other sources, they found that it caused orders of magnitude fewer deaths than fossil fuel-based energy. And that's not even considering the long-term impact of climate change from burning fossil fuels. With modern reactors, safety is drastically increased, and nuclear waste is drastically decreased."
That's exactly right. Yang is particularly interested in reactors powered by thorium instead of uranium, because thorium is more efficient, and more plentiful, and because thorium reactors can't produce materials suitable for use in nuclear weapons. Plus: "Thorium reactors produce less waste than uranium reactors. Thorium waste remains radioactive for several hundred years instead of several thousand years. Thorium-based molten salt reactors are safer than earlier-generation nuclear reactors, and the potential for a catastrophic event is negligible, due to the design of the reactor and the fact that thorium is not, by itself, fissile."
Yang is absolutely right to make these points, and he's gotten some well-deserved attention. But it's surprising that he hasn't gotten more, given how much we're hearing about the crisis nature of climate change. Because if you take climate change seriously, you have to take nuclear power seriously. As Mike Shellenberger writes in Forbes, if Germany and California had based their emissions plans on nuclear instead of "renewables" like solar and wind, they'd have 100% clean power now.
But they didn't, and they don't, and the question is whether the rest of us will learn from their mistake. The International Energy Agency reports that planned nuclear retirements will already lead to 4 billion metric tons of extra carbon dioxide emissions. If it makes sense to keep functioning reactors online longer rather than replacing them with fossil fuels, then surely it makes sense to replace existing fossil fuel plants with new nuclear reactors.
There's something of a renaissance going on in nuclear technology, with small "inherently safe" reactors being put forward to fill gaps in supply. These reactors could be mass-produced on assembly lines for much lower costs (current reactors are custom-built on site) and because of their small size could more easily be placed where needed.
Sure, people are scared and invoke things like Chernobyl or Three Mile Island, but when they do, they're mostly thinking about the absurdly dramatized fictional versions of those incidents. (As Shellenberger writes, "The reason they fictionalize nuclear disasters like Chernobyl is because they kill so few people"). Yang's plan specifically recognizes that, noting that nuclear power causes orders of magnitudes fewer deaths than fossil fuels.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden "decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world's most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power's intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power."
Andrew Yang's right. So why wait?
It's time for our leaders to get their heads out of thriller movies and start supporting a massive shift to nuclear power. Because it's a crisis, and in a crisis, you do things you haven't done before.

(As Shellenberger writes, "The reason they fictionalize nuclear disasters like Chernobyl is because they kill so few people"). Yang's plan specifically recognizes that, noting that nuclear power causes orders of magnitudes fewer deaths than fossil fuels.
And the change could be done quickly. As Joshua Goldstein, Staffan Qvist and Steven Pinker note in The New York Times, France and Sweden "decarbonized their grids decades ago and now emit less than a tenth of the world average of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. They remain among the world's most pleasant places to live and enjoy much cheaper electricity than Germany to boot. They did this with nuclear power. And they did it fast, taking advantage of nuclear power's intense concentration of energy per pound of fuel. France replaced almost all of its fossil-fueled electricity with nuclear power nationwide in just 15 years; Sweden, in about 20 years. In fact, most of the fastest additions of clean electricity historically are countries rolling out nuclear power."
Andrew Yang's right. So why wait?
It's time for our leaders to get their heads out of thriller movies and start supporting a massive shift to nuclear power. Because it's a crisis, and in a crisis, you do things you haven't done before.

Texto completo: In the 1870s, New York City was a haven for artists and radicals. But it was also the nursery for a new kind of moral activism. Led by Anthony Comstock, the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice became a media sensation by targeting feminists in a culture war over obscenity and birth control. He then used his fame to lobby Congress for laws that arguably halted the progress of reproductive rights for almost a century. His tactics -- a combination of media manipulation and ruthless legal strategies -- are a precursor to those used by anti-feminists on social media and in Washington today.
Comstock started his career as a small-time crusader for Christian values. He moved to Brooklyn from Connecticut in the late 1860s and took a job working for a dry goods merchant, but he had bigger plans. When another clerk revealed that he was buying erotic literature at a bookstore nearby, Comstock took it upon himself to investigate. After buying some of the illicit materials, he went to the police and got the shopkeeper arrested for obscenity. Hailed in a few local papers as a hero, Comstock gained a taste for notoriety.
He joined the activist wing of the YMCA, inviting New York reporters along to his busts, where he worked with the police to shut down shops that did mail-order business in rubber dildos and "French postcards" featuring photographs of scantily clad women. Comstock gave speeches and wrote books about how the postal system had become a "putrid stream" of the "filthy productions of licentious minds."
Supported by wealthy men including J. Pierpont Morgan and Samuel Colgate (yes, the founder of the soap and toothpaste company), Comstock became a full-time activist. But he remained mostly a local nuisance until he found a target famous enough to get him national attention. He decided to take down Victoria Woodhull, who was running for president in the 1872 election. She and her sister Tennessee Claflin had opened the first woman-run brokerage firm on Wall Street and ran a newspaper, Woodhull & Claflin's Weekly, dedicated to women's suffrage, socialism and "free love," a term she popularized to describe sex outside the strictures of marriage.
To call attention to her campaign, Woodhull decided to publish an article about the celebrity minister Henry Ward Beecher. Though Beecher came from a liberal family -- he was the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" -- he was opposed to free love. And yet he had been having affairs for years, an open secret in New York society. When Woodhull published her tell-all, complete with salacious details about Beecher impregnating his best friend's wife, the minister was ruined. But the papers sold like crazy.
That's when Comstock stepped in. He ordered a copy of the newspaper through the postal system, then took the evidence to federal marshals so they could arrest Woodhull for mailing "obscene" depictions of Beecher's sex life. The charges didn't stick, but the trial turned Comstock into a national figure, beloved by conservatives who thought women's rights had gone too far.
A year later, buoyed by donations to his cause, Comstock arrived in Washington to lobby politicians to strengthen federal obscenity laws. The postal system in the 1870s was something like the internet, bringing people into contact with ideas and people they never would have found otherwise. It was also a channel for pornography. Comstock wanted to expand the nation's laws criminalizing the act of mailing obscene material over state lines. He met privately with policymakers, indulging their prurience by displaying a steamer trunk full of sex toys and erotica that he had ordered by post.
He capitalized on a wave of anti-feminist sentiment directed at activists like Woodhull, who had already irritated Congress by appearing before them years earlier to demand the vote. Woodhull's allies weren't just suffragists. They were people who promoted free love as an alternative to the domestic oppression of marriage, and spiritualists who rejected conventional Christianity. Still others taught women how to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And all of them used the postal system to spread their ideas.
Comstock -- not satisfied with attacking just pornography -- argued that the definition of obscenity should be expanded to include materials related to reproductive health, birth control and abortion, and he drafted legislation with some help from a Supreme Court justice, William Strong. In 1873, Congress passed the "Act for the Suppression of Trade in, and Circulation of, Obscene Literature and Articles of Immoral Use." The press called it the Comstock Law. States rushed to pass even more draconian versions, with Connecticut banning all forms of birth control entirely.
Congress deputized Comstock as a "special agent" for the post office. At one point, he earned a knife scar across his face when he busted a mail-order pornography operation in a New Jersey basement. Not surprisingly, Comstock was an easy target for mockery. In 1905, George Bernard Shaw, the playwright, referred to censorship-happy moralism as "Comstockery" in a letter to The New York Times. In a cartoon from "The Masses" magazine in 1915, an outraged Comstock drags an unconscious woman before a judge and screams, "Your honor! This woman gave birth to a naked child!"
He may have been easy to satirize, but Comstock's tactics were deadly serious. He bragged that he'd driven at least a dozen women to suicide. His victims included the Chicago spiritualist Ida Craddock, who killed herself after being sentenced to five years in prison for mailing "obscene" articles about reproductive health and tantric yoga. He reveled in the brutality of his tactics. As the historian Amy Werbel writes in her book "Lust on Trial," Comstock's abortion busts sometimes involved dragging women away from their doctors in the middle of a procedure. Writing in his ledger, Comstock noted the arrest of a "very sick" 17-year-old, Barbara Voss, who was charged with "wantonness" and taken, presumably still bleeding, to the police.
The Comstock Laws remained on the books in many states for over half a century after his death. It wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that courts began to relax restrictions on birth control and abortion.
It might be tempting to laugh off today's Anthony Comstocks, whether that's Milo Yiannopoulos attacking Leslie Jones on Twitter, or Vice President Mike Pence expressing his fear of meeting with women alone. But history reminds us that Comstock's strategy worked. He used the courts to prevent generations of women from gaining access to information about reproduction and sexual health. He normalized the idea that the government could spy on our mail to ferret out "immorality." Today's legal battles over abortion access and gender identity are a continuation of his activism. His name may be forgotten, but the age of Comstockery is not over.

The Rundown on Trump, Biden and a Whistle-Blower's Complaint

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump is under intense scrutiny over a classified whistle-blower complaint about his behavior, which at least partly involves his dealings with Ukraine's new president and Mr. Trump's call for Ukraine's government to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
Here are some of the basic facts behind the controversy.
What did Mr. Trump do?
In a July 25 phone call, Mr. Trump is said to have pressed the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Mr. Biden's younger son, Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. Mr. Trump has seized on an unsubstantiated theory that Mr. Biden was trying to protect the company from prosecution when he called for the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016. Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers, has pushed the Ukrainian government to investigate the matter.
Why is this coming up now?
Because of an intelligence community whistle-blower who filed a complaint last month about the president's actions. An inspector general deemed the complaint "credible" and "urgent" and forwarded it to the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who has refused to share it with Congress. The issue was brought into the open when the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, sent an angry letter to Mr. Maguire on Sept. 10 demanding the complaint be shared with his panel.
What did the whistle-blower claim?
The full extent of the whistle-blower's complaint, as well as the whistle-blower's identity, is not publicly known. Reporting by The New York Times and others has established that the complaint involves Mr. Trump's interactions with Ukraine and a phone call with a foreign leader -- possibly, but not necessarily, Mr. Zelensky. It is not clear if it includes other matters.
Did Mr. Trump use American foreign policy to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival?
This is the big question. The White House this summer blocked a package of military assistance to Ukraine. The aid was intended to help the country defend itself from Russian territorial aggression, including a military conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. The delay of the aid was first publicly disclosed about a month after the July phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Trump is not known to have openly linked the aid -- which has since been released -- to his demands for political investigations, but many Democrats believe that may be the case.
What does Mr. Trump say?
The president insists that he has been unfairly accused, saying -- without offering evidence -- that the whistle-blower is "partisan" and that Democrats and the news media are initiating a new "witch hunt" against him. Mr. Trump has said that he is aware that his conversations with foreign leaders are monitored by numerous government officials and that he would not incriminate himself so easily.
What is Mr. Giuliani's role in this?
Mr. Giuliani has communicated with Ukrainian officials for months about the Bidens, as well as about the circumstances of the 2016 disclosures of payments earmarked by a Russia-aligned Ukrainian political party to Paul Manafort, Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign chairman, who is now serving a prison sentence on charges related to his Ukrainian political work. Mr. Giuliani has sought information about both subjects, and traveled to Madrid this summer for a meeting with one of Mr. Zelensky's top aides, whom he urged to investigate the matters.
Did Mr. Biden do something wrong?
There is no evidence that Mr. Biden intentionally tried to help his son when he pushed for the dismissal of the Ukrainian prosecutor, who was widely seen in the West as corrupt. Stamping out high-level corruption in Ukraine has long been a central goal of United States policy toward the country, and a standard condition for Western aid. On Saturday, Mr. Biden said he had never spoken with his son about any overseas work.
Mr. Biden played a lead role in the Obama administration's diplomacy with Kiev, but Obama administration officials worried that his son's work for the energy company, Burisma Holdings, could create at least the perception of a conflict of interest.

An American Summer Stained in Blood

Texto completo: Mass shootings this summer came one after the next, sometimes only hours apart, and hurled the nation into an agonizing routine: a sudden burst of violence followed by solemn mourning and pleas for change, and then another burst, somewhere else.
There were ones that rattled the whole country -- in an El Paso Walmart, on the streets of Dayton, Ohio, along a highway near Odessa, Tex. But there were still others, eruptions that plunged one town or one neighborhood into grief but went mostly unnoticed elsewhere.
In the end, even in a country numb to the daily toll of homicides, the scale of this violent summer was shocking. There were 26 mass shootings between Memorial Day and Labor Day, leaving 126 people dead and dozens more injured. There were close to two such shootings a week, at a rate of more than one death a day. The violence touched 18 states, in huge cities and rural counties.
Among those killed were a 3-year-old girl at a house in the Miami suburbs and a 90-year-old man shopping in El Paso. There were people enjoying the summer -- at a house party in New Mexico and a festival in California. And there were people just going about their daily routines -- watching television, settling into bed, driving down the highway.
Then came the bullets, the sirens, the tears.
"It's like a great awakening for many people in terms of realizing how much America has changed," said the Rev. Renard D. Allen Jr., a pastor in Dayton, who presided over the funeral of one of nine people killed there. "The world we live in now is one in which no place is safe, no lives really matter, when it comes to violence."
The massacres set off calls for new gun laws and stricter background checks in statehouses and in Congress. But as weeks passed with no bipartisan consensus, little changed and the issue started to fade once more.
The New York Times analyzed every shooting in the United States that resulted in three or more deaths, not including the gunman, from Memorial Day to Labor Day, the unofficial summer season.
Though every shooting was distinct, patterns emerged. In three of the four deadliest killings, the gunmen used military-style weapons. In more than half the mass killings, the suspect had a familial or romantic relationship with at least one victim. In every case, the authorities identified a suspect. And every one of those suspects was male.
An Office Shooting Reveals
The Risks From Within
With the workweek almost over and summer in sight, a man with two handguns stormed through municipal offices in Virginia Beach on the last afternoon of May. He began shooting.
Employers across the nation have invested in elaborate security systems to keep dangerous people out. But as is often the case, this threat came from someone on the inside.
The gunman, a longtime city engineer, had shown glimpses of volatility before: a violent encounter at work, a hasty resignation email. He was able to walk right into the building.
"Hardening your target with physical protection isn't going to protect you from a guy who has keycard access," said Katherine Schweit, a former F.B.I. official who studies mass killings.
The victims included Ryan Keith Cox, a utilities worker with a golden singing voice, who died shielding colleagues; Richard H. Nettleton, an Army veteran; and Herbert Snelling, the only victim who was not a city worker, who had come to ask questions about a permit.
Their deaths were the first in what felt like a summer-long siege, the start of a bleak routine of panicked 911 calls and mourning.
A Swift Police Response,
And Still Nine Killed
The police are trained to race toward gunfire and take on a gunman -- even when their handguns are overmatched by a high-powered weapon. In three of the summer's four deadliest shootings, an AR-style or AK-style gun was used.
That included the massacre in Dayton, Ohio, where officers shot and fatally wounded a gunman within 32 seconds of his opening fire on a packed street lined with bars, nightclubs and shops.
The toll was still devastating. Using an AR-style weapon, the gunman killed nine people in barely half a minute.
Thomas J. McNichols, a father of four who played kickball at family gatherings, was enjoying a night out with friends when he was killed. Reverend Allen, who presided over Mr. McNichols's funeral, said the experience brought him "face to face with a level of pain that is almost too intense to describe."
"We're reeling," Reverend Allen said. "We're recovering, but we're reeling."
Many Killings Happened
At Home, Behind Closed Doors
The television was playing. There was food on the living room table. A man had killed four members of his wife's family.
"It could have been any neighborhood in this town," said Lt. Paul Joseph of the San Jose, Calif., police, who examined that crime scene in June. "It could have been any neighborhood in any town."
The case was not an outlier. More than half of the mass killing suspects this summer had an intimate connection to at least one victim. Among them: a teenager in Alabama accused of killing five relatives; a father in Iowa who killed his wife and two school-age sons; a man in Oklahoma charged with killing his wife and stepchildren.
The sheriff in Marshall County, Okla., said he had never heard of trouble from the man who lived on rural Page Road, near Madill, until deputies found the man's wife dead in the master bathroom and his two stepchildren killed in their beds.
"He wasn't on our radar at all," Sheriff Danny Cryer said.
Such is often the case in familicides, a disturbingly common type of mass killing -- but the sort that draws less attention than those involving strangers in public places. Though motives are often complex, researchers have found that many mass killers share a history of hating women, assaulting wives, girlfriends and female family members, or sharing misogynistic views online.
In more than 20 years patrolling Marshall County, population 16,800, Sheriff Cryer could recall only one other triple homicide. Investigators believe that case was also rooted in domestic violence.
In at Least One Shooting, Bigotry as Motive
Hate-crime reports across the nation increased three years in a row, with 7,100 incidents in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available.
A vast majority of those crimes did not result in deaths. But this summer saw one of the worst hate-driven massacres in modern American history at a Walmart in El Paso, which the police believe was motivated by hatred of Hispanic people.
Armed with an AK-47-style rifle, the gunman stormed through the aisles of the busy store near the United States-Mexico border, spraying dozens of shoppers with bullets.
He killed Jordan Anchondo, a mother who used her body to protect her infant. He killed Javier Rodriguez, who played high school soccer. He killed Margie Reckard, whose funeral was attended by hundreds after her husband extended an open invitation. He killed 19 more -- citizens of the United States, Mexico and Germany.
The El Paso police said the actions of one man inside the store may have kept the death toll from going higher, though they have not provided precise details of his actions. He was wearing a short-sleeved dress shirt and a brown hat. Detectives were hoping to find the man, interview him and honor him.
"We believe this HERO helped save several lives including an infant," the police said in a mid-August Facebook post that has been shared 4,700 times.
A month later, his identity remains unknown.
An Inordinate Amount Of Violence, by Any Metric
The list of shootings examined by The Times includes killings tracked by the Gun Violence Archive, a nonprofit group that focuses on shootings, and verified by law enforcement records, interviews with the authorities and local media accounts.
While several of the summer's 26 mass shootings dominated headlines, others -- like a triple homicide in rural Pennsylvania -- received little national attention.
Jesse Northrup's life was in crisis. He was suffering from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. He had stopped taking his medication. He had just been fired from his job at a meatpacking plant. Then on June 13, Mr. Northrup went to a store and bought a Smith & Wesson .40-caliber handgun. A day later, he fired four fatal bullets -- at his mother, his stepfather, another man and then at himself.
Every Suspect Male,
And No Case Unsolved
Mass shootings are hard to prevent, dangerous to interrupt and devastating in scope. But they are usually easy to solve. Whether the attacks ended by shootout, suicide or arrest, none of the suspects in the summer's mass shootings avoided detection.
This summer, the suspects included a 14-year-old boy in Alabama and a 62-year-old man in Georgia, but no women or girls. Experts say it is exceedingly rare for women to carry out mass shootings.
In many cases, including a triple homicide in August at a house in San Antonio, the gunman killed himself. In others, including in Virginia Beach, the police killed the gunman.
And even when the gunman flees, the police often do not have to look far to make an arrest.
It was a chaotic scene in Burlington, N.C.: a barrage of bullets at an apartment complex, three young men dead, witnesses pointing toward where the gunman had run. Soon, officers found Hyquan J. Parker, 26, who was charged with three counts of first-degree murder.
Mr. Parker, an acquaintance of the victims, had killed a man as a teenager and was convicted of second-degree murder. He was released from prison after about seven years.
Children Among the Victims
In 11 Shootings
Shootings at American schools have fueled much of the national conversation about gun violence. But this summer, children were killed in their homes, at a shopping center, on a highway and at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California.
The man who brought an AK-47-style rifle to the Gilroy Garlic Festival, a joyous mix of food and music and children's games, did not seem to care whom he shot. He had plotted against religious institutions, federal buildings and political groups from both major parties. Then, for reasons domestic terrorism investigators have not detailed, he settled on the annual Garlic Festival.
Keyla Salazar, one of two schoolchildren killed that day, was about to turn 14. Stephen Romero, 6, loved Legos and Batman.
In Other Mass Shootings, No Known Motives
Mass killings can be inspired by bigotry, by domestic anger, by botched drug deals or, in one case in California, by an argument over golf. But sometimes, including in Las Vegas in 2017, the site of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, the reasons for a massacre are never discovered.
The same has been true in Des Moines, where the police accused a man of killing three people, including two children, in a house this summer. Grecia Daniela Alvarado-Flores was 11. Her brother, Ever Jose Mejia-Flores, was 5. Their mom died, too.
The suspect, now charged with murder, lived in the same house, but was not related to the victims. The police still do not know why he did it.
A Relentless Cycle Of the Most Vicious Sort
The shootings came one after the other. On June 23: South Carolina and California. On the last weekend in July: Wisconsin and California. On Aug. 3: El Paso. And then early the next morning: Dayton.
Even in a country numb to the daily toll of gun violence, the pace of mass death struck deep. When Ohio's governor spoke at a vigil in August, Dayton residents drowned him out with shouts of "Do something!"
Before the end of that month, there would be seven more mass killings across the nation.
By Labor Day weekend, the national debate about gun control, reopened by El Paso and Dayton, had returned to a familiar stalemate. Democrats wanted stronger background checks and, in some cases, an assault weapons ban. Many Republicans did not. Sweeping national action seemed unlikely.
Then a man fleeing a traffic stop began shooting at random at motorists between Odessa and Midland using a military-style rifle. ABC News reported that he bought it through a private-sale loophole after failing a background check because of a mental illness.
And the summer ended much as it had begun, with a new round of panicky 911 calls, another set of wrenching vigils, a new wave of pleas for change.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
Credit: By MITCH SMITH; After the El Paso shooting, several government agencies in the United States and Mexico provided different spellings of the names of several victims. In some cases, those victims' family members, friends or employers provided other spellings. For this article, we relied on spellings that had appeared in past New York Times coverage, as well as government and family accounts. In several cases, there is still disagreement among officials about the correct spelling. The count of 26 mass shootings includes an episode in Santa Maria, Calif., in which the police say a man fatally shot two people after an argument about golf, then entered his mobile home and killed two more people. He then burned the mobile home down. Officials are not yet certain whether the third and fourth victims in that case died in the shooting or in the fire.

Texto completo: Inspo. Dad joke. Fabulosity! Rhotic. These are among the 533 new terms and definitions that Merriam-Webster added to its dictionary this month.
But none have drawn as much attention as the quotidian pronoun "they," to which Merriam-Webster has added a new sense, or meaning: "used to refer to a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary." (Nonbinary people do not identify as either male or female.)
Meanwhile, in a separate lexicological dispute, tens of thousands of people are petitioning the Oxford Dictionary of English to strike derogatory synonyms from its definition of "woman."
Both episodes made headlines this week, pointing to the enduring relevance of dictionaries -- old arbiters of fundamental meaning that are now engaging the public not only with books, but also via apps and (occasionally cheeky) Twitter timelines.
[Read more about dictionaries on Twitter and the perils of politicization .]
Merriam-Webster's move, announced on Tuesday, reflects the fact that many nonbinary people use "they" as their singular third-person pronoun instead of "she" or "he." (As an example of usage, the entry cites a June article in The New York Times.)
That the oldest dictionary publisher in the United States has added its imprimatur to this meaning of the pronoun could be seen as a powerful statement about evolving understandings of gender identity.
Or it could be seen as something much more elementary: a reflection of changing times.
The dictionary, after all, is more of a rearview mirror than a vanguard of change, said Peter Sokolowski, an editor and lexicographer with Merriam-Webster.
"If we see that a term is used frequently, then it's going to get into the dictionary," Mr. Sokolowski said. "We wouldn't be doing our jobs if it weren't reflecting the truth of the way language is used."
Still, a major dictionary can add credibility to an existing term or definition, said Laura A. Jacobs, a therapist in New York who focuses on L.G.B.T.Q. clients and whose preferred pronouns include she, he and they -- or none at all.
"I think this is a sign of the times," Mx. Jacobs said. "They're acknowledging that this is a term that is in widespread use, and it's a term that's important to many people."
The American Heritage Dictionary also mentions gender in its definition of "they," noting that it can be "used as a singular personal pronoun for someone who does not identify as either male or female." Both Lexico (which is affiliated with the Oxford Dictionary of English) and Dictionary.com mention the nonbinary use of "they" only in their usage notes for the term.
In the United States, the Merriam-Webster dictionary is particularly prominent, said Bryan A. Garner, a lexicographer and the author of "Garner's Modern English Usage," which is published by Oxford University Press.
It's good at marketing, too. "These publicity campaigns seem to be pretty successful, in the sense of frequently making front-page news in national newspapers," Mr. Garner said.
Some pop culture news last week made Merriam-Webster's announcement seem especially apposite; on Sept. 13, the British singer and four-time Grammy winner Sam Smith, who had been referred to as "he," announced that they were changing their pronouns to "they/them."
"After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am," they wrote on Twitter.
"When prominent people make these changes, more people notice," Mr. Sokolowski said. "And that accelerates the change, too."
[Read more about people who identify as nonbinary .]
Reactions to the nonbinary meaning of "they" have been mixed, with some critics saying it's awkward to use the word as a singular pronoun. But Mr. Sokolowski said English speakers already use the singular "they" even when they are not referring to nonbinary people. (As in: "No one has to go if they don't want to.")
In that sense, the singular "they" has been in use for more than 600 years, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, a historical dictionary that is distinct from the more modern Oxford Dictionary of English.
Mr. Sokolowski added that languages change all the time, and objections to those transmutations -- however loud they may be in the moment -- are eventually forgotten. He said the evolution of "they" is something like what happened to "you" centuries ago, when it drifted from plural to singular, nudging "thee" and "thou" into Elizabethan obscurity.
Mr. Garner challenged that comparison. "This nonbinary 'they' is a very conscious linguistic change that has resulted from a kind of social movement," he said, comparing it instead to the campaign, led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson in the late 1980s, to popularize the term "African-American."
If using the word "they" to describe a nonbinary person feels difficult, Mx. Jacobs said, it's important to remember that it is a sign of respect. "Choosing not to work on it means you're O.K. with harming that other person," they added.
The tension over whether dictionaries are reflective or prescriptive erupted in a different way across the Atlantic, with a petition questioning whether, or when, historic terms should be stricken from the record.
Maria Beatrice Giovanardi, a women's rights activist in the United Kingdom, said Merriam-Webster's announcement seemed like a positive step. But she has focused her ire on another major dictionary: the Oxford Dictionary of English.
Ms. Giovanardi said that in January, she looked up the word "woman" on Google, which draws from Oxford's dictionaries when people ask the search engine to define a word.
She noted that the synonyms included terms like "biddy," "wench," and "piece." (In the screenshots she shared online, the Google search result classified those words, respectively, as "informal," "archaic" and "derogatory.") And she noted that in an online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English, examples for the usage of "woman" included phrases like "one of his sophisticated London women."
Her petition has lately begun to pick up steam because of news media exposure, she said. As of Thursday morning, about 30,000 people had signed it.
Reached for comment, a spokeswoman for Oxford University Press referred to a blog post by Katherine Connor Martin, the head of lexical content strategy.
"These texts are based on the methodologies of descriptive, corpus-based lexicography, meaning that editors analyze large quantities of evidence from real-life use to determine the meanings of words," the post said. "If there is evidence of an offensive or derogatory word or meaning being widely used in English, it will not be excluded from the dictionary solely on the grounds that it is offensive or derogatory."
But Ms. Giovanardi said the injudicious material should be removed or replaced. "I think that the dictionary should be a place without all of these biases," she said.
Oxford is taking the points raised in the petition very seriously, a spokeswoman said, and researching possible uses of "woman" that are not yet covered in the dictionary.
For Merriam-Webster, which seems to precipitate news headlines every time it rolls out fresh batches of new terms, the flurry of attention evinces an enduring interest in denotation, Mr. Sokolowski said.
"If we both agree on what, for example, 'socialism' means, or what 'fact' means, then we can move forward even if we're on opposite sides of an argument," he added. "If we can agree on terms, then we can make some progress. That is a role I think the dictionary has always played. It's just simply amplified now by the speed of communication."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

In Our View Cheers &amp; Jeers: Volcano monitoring; gas leak

Texto completo: Cheers: To volcano monitoring. The U.S. Geological Survey is adding three monitoring stations to Mount Hood to keep watch on the volcano. Yes, Mount Hood is an active volcano, even if it has not erupted in more than 200 years. And a recent article in The New York Times painted a near-apocalyptic portrait of the last time it went off: “high-speed avalanches of hot rock, gas and ash (raced) down its slopes. Those flows quickly melted the snow and ice and mixed with the meltwater to create violent slurries as thick as concrete that traveled huge distances. They destroyed everything in their path.”
The monitoring stations will allow officials to warn the public if there are rumblings inside the mountain. We hope that is not necessary, but as people in this part of the country know, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to volcanoes.
Jeers: To unwanted gas. A gas leak last week resulted in the evacuation of a section of downtown Vancouver. A forklift operator working on construction at the Vancouvercenter complex apparently collided with a natural gas meter, causing the leak. A handful of local businesses and residents were evacuated, and damage fortunately was limited to being an inconvenience.
Something worthy of a cheer did come out of the incident. Thanks to the Clark Regional Emergency Services Agency, about 3,000 evacuation messages were sent to people who either have landlines in the area or have signed up for public alerts. “They can self-register and decide how they want to get their message, CRESA's Cindy Stanley. The incident likely will raise awareness and bring more people to Cresa911.org to sign up. That is a good thing; but we still think unwanted gas deserves a jeer.
Cheers: To Habitat for Humanity. The local Evergreen chapter of the international organization is celebrating the completion of McKibbin Commons, a 10-home development in the Father Blanchet Park neighborhood. Habitat for Humanity builds low-cost homes and sells them to needy families with zero-interest mortgages; homebuyers typically help construct the houses. As the organization's website boasts: “We build strength, stability and self-reliance through shelter.”
McKibbin Commons is particularly meaningful. It is named for John McKibbin, a former board member and community leader who died in a plane crash in 2016. The development is the Evergreen chapter's largest to date, but plans are underway for more than 20 homes on two plots recently acquired from local churches.
Jeers: To traffic jams. Even on the river, a backup can be problematic. Emergency repairs at the Bonneville Navigation Lock, adjacent to Bonneville Dam, have prevented ships from working their way around the dam.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is working around the clock to fix the problem. We hope repairs go smoothly and traffic can resume flowing soon.
Cheers: To Vigor Industrial. It was merely symbolic, but the company made its Vancouver debut this week with a “laying the keel” ceremony. Vigor is moving into the space along the Columbia River previously inhabited by Christensen Shipyards and will build landing craft for the U.S. Army as part of a 10-year contract.
Within a couple of years, the facility is expected to employ up to 300 people. Perhaps most important, many of those will be good-paying, blue-collar jobs. At a time when new jobs typically are in the service or tech sectors, it can be difficult for cities to lure manufacturers. Vigor will add to Vancouver's economic diversity and strengthen the lo

There will never be certainty about Kavanaugh allegations

Texto completo: My earliest memory is of the time I put a key into an electrical socket. Fine, cue the jokes, I electrocuted myself. And such a vivid memory that makes.
I can remember the keys, which were the color of an old penny, and how I slipped them off the bright yellow Formica of our kitchen island. I remember, too, the black Bakelite of the electrical socket. I remember noticing how neatly the one would fit in the other. And then I remember lying in our foyer while my mother, apparently on the phone with my pediatrician, shouted from the kitchen to my father: "The doctor says give her a glass of water!"
None of which happened the way I remember it.
I really did electrocute myself, but at 18 months, I was far too young to form durable memories. And how could I recall looking down at the top of our island when I was a toddler? It's what psychologists call "confabulation," the inadvertent construction of false memories. In my case, I probably heard the story more than once and, over time, created a memory to match, built from fragments of real memories -- for example, how that island looked when I was 11.
Inadvertent confabulation is surprisingly easy, and common. At age 44, Elizabeth Loftus, one of the leading researchers on the fallibility of memory, "remembered" that as a teenager she had found her mother's body in the family pool. As with my false memory, the event was real; her mother had drowned when Loftus was 14. But Loftus didn't discover the body. An uncle had mistakenly planted the idea.
Loftus' work, and her own experience, confront us with a difficult realization: False memories feel as real as true ones, even the really important ones.
As you've probably guessed, this isn't a random jaunt down memory lane. A year after the Senate fight over Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly have published "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh." The book aspires to provide better corroboration of the allegations against Kavanaugh than was available last year: Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he tried to rape her when they were both teenagers and Deborah Ramirez's accusation that he exposed himself to her when they were students at Yale.
Yet as the renewed fighting over Kavanaugh last week suggests, we will never know which of these stories is true, or how much of them is true, because by now everyone's memories are just too impaired -- maybe by alcohol, maybe by trauma, certainly by time.
It's not enough to find the accusers (or the defenders) sincere. Loftus honestly believed she found her mother's body.
Trying to firm up fuzzy memories about decades-old events is an invitation to confabulation. The media circus surrounding the Kavanaugh confirmation further muddled things; any witness who comes forward today must be presumed to have gathered significant details from the earlier coverage.
All of which means that we will never have any more certainty about the Kavanaugh story than we have right now -- which is to say, none at all. We can either find a way to live with that fact, and each other, or partisans on both sides can keep tearing the country apart by insisting that they know the one clear truth about an irretrievably murky past.

Texto completo: As you read this, I’m away on vacation — unless you’re one of those people who let their newspapers stack up, that is. In that case, I might already be back. For the rest of you, look for me again Oct. 2.
Speaking of papers, many of you offered comments online and via email on my Sept. 1 column on the cessation of newspaper sales at Starbucks.
Not surprisingly, many of you enjoy newspapers, especially the printed version.
“I still get the local paper and read it every day. Online isn’t the same,” said Leah Leander Fuller.
“I like an actual paper copy! Especially because I love doing the New York Times crossword puzzle,” Rose Davidson said. “Just no fun to look at it online.”
“I still like spreading the physical newspaper out on my kitchen counter, double pager. It is my solace before a hectic day,” Laura Turnbull shared.
“I just do not want to depend on internet news. I will mourn the day when print dies,” said John Kolody.
“I like a physical newspaper also. Currently get the New York and LA Times along with the Daily Bulletin of course,” says John Fatini. (I like his “of course.”) Fatini continues: “After finishing I take all three to the Chino Senior Center where they are appreciated seven days a week.”
Now that’s an interesting idea. You could drop off your newspaper to a senior center or other place where people might like it. That is, if you haven’t already completed the crossword. They hate that.
Often I leave my morning Daily Bulletin behind at a bakery or coffeehouse if I’m out. Someone might pick it up and be intrigued.
My colleague Ryan Hagen was at a car dealership in San Bernardino the other day when he spotted a copy of that morning’s Sun. The sight “inspired a mother in the waiting room to explain to her roughly 5-year-old daughter what a newspaper is,” Hagen said. “The daughter seems like a fan!”
Get ’em while they’re young.
It’s not just Starbucks that isn’t carrying newspapers anymore, or Barnes & Noble, which stopped a year or so ago. “My Bristol Farms, and I suspect of all them, no longer stock papers,” wrote retired newsman Van Gordon Sauter.
Susan Strother Carrier said she may fight back against the Starbucks decision in her own way.
“I have the Sunday NY Times delivered. When I’m finished reading it,” she said, “I think I’ll start dropping it off at my local Pomona Starbucks.” That’s the spirit.
Karen Karlsson puts a digital spin on the whole thing: “I read my digital subscription to the NY Times (and the IV Daily Bulletin) on my laptop in Starbucks!” Hey, Starbucks has free wifi, so why not?
Let me add, I’m agnostic on print versus digital, enjoying both. Basically I just want to stay employed. Get whichever one appeals to you.
“I miss reading a physical copy of the newspaper, but I am, as of today, the proud owner of an IVDB online subscription!” Judi Holsten Guizado said a couple of weeks back. I hope it will serve her in good stead.
“While physical newspaper sales are diminishing quickly, there will always be a need and desire for great content and stories,” says Joshua Swodeck, who supports us online.
In fact, when someone groused to him recently about how we at the Bulletin have the nerve to want people to pay for our product, Swodeck pulled out a dollar bill — our trial subscriptions online are 99 cents for 13 weeks — and offered it up. (It wasn’t accepted.)
Some ex-readers are disaffected by a perceived political bias in their former newspaper of choice. Randie Kreutzer canceled the L.A. Times after 30 years but said: “I really miss reading the news in print and I do get the San Gabriel Valley Tribune delivered on Sunday as a concession to my need to stay informed. Otherwise, you can count me as one reader who doesn’t miss buying a paper.”
Regarding my quest for a New York Times, newspaper carrier Ray Bernal suggested home delivery of the Times or the Post. He added that “throwing one of those NYT Sunday editions” is “like a shot put.”
I could subscribe, but I already read four papers, including my own, and don’t have the time or dough for a daily Big Apple paper too. Plus, I can read the Times at a library if I need to, albeit not over a beverage.
When the paper became unavailable at Starbucks, though, I did get a sudden craving for what was out of reach. As I wrote here, I found a nearly week-old NYT Sunday edition at Ontario’s Newsboy Books and ponied up $6 plus tax, figuring there would still be plenty of interest. And there was.
I read how “Sesame Street” has used music in its 50 years, with the singer-songwriter Leslie Feist talking about how her “1234” song became her signature tune after the show used it. I read an interview with actor Tom Hiddleston and articles about use of the term “gaslighting” and about the history of nighttime tennis in the U.S. Open. I chuckled at learning the term “hicksters,” which refers to hipsters who live in the sticks.
Two weeks after I bought the paper, I finished it off last weekend by reading its magazine profile of Neil Young. I would say I more than got my $6 worth.
The Starbucks move seemed to have a ripple effect on the NYT’s local availability. Newsboy co-owner Jack Gingold called distribution “problematic” but said the store, which is closed Sundays, gets the Sunday bulldog edition by 1:30 p.m. Saturday.
I’ll have to pick up one again. Or see if Susan Carrier has left it behind at a Pomona Starbucks.

'More to be told': New York Times reporter says Ukraine story a 'significant liability' for Joe Biden

Texto completo: A New York Times reporter says Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden faces a "significant liability" in a developing story about allegations that the former vice president may have pressured the Ukrainian government on behalf of his lobbyist son Hunter.
Potentially damaging details have yet to be reported, journalist Ken Vogel said during a cable news appearance Friday in which he additionally warned that President Trump and his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, who want Biden to be investigated for potential conflicts of interest, have gotten some of the facts wrong.
Vogel's reporting, which includes a May 1 story that helped generate renewed scrutiny of Hunter Biden's ties to an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch, also flies in the face of Joe Biden's dismissal of the controversy on Friday when he said "not one single credible outlet has given any credibility" to Trump's claims of possible misconduct.
The situation involving Biden's son working for Burisma Holdings "is a significant liability for Joe Biden," Vogel said during a panel led by MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace. "There is a story here. We’ve told some of it. There is more to be told. We are going to continue to sort of pull that back."
"That said," he continued, "the way that Rudy is inserting himself into it is both not helpful, I think, to Rudy and to Trump because it kind of jumbles it. He’s getting the facts wrong, and he is making it appear as if this is just a partisan hit job, whereas if he would just kind of leave the reporters to do the work on it, I think that, you know, potentially this story might be taken more seriously."
iFrame Object
Vogel's May 1 report is an examination of how in 2016 then-Vice President Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees if Ukraine did not fire its top prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who had undertaken an anti-corruption investigation into the owner of Burisma Holdings, which had employed Hunter Biden as a board member in 2014. Soon after, Shokin, who himself had been accused of corruption, was forced out by the Ukrainian Parliament.
Former Ukrainian and U.S. officials told the Washington Post that the Burisma case had gone dormant because Shokin was fired, and Shokin's successor, Yuri Lutsenko, told Bloomberg News in May there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Biden family. But that has not stopped Giuliani from publicizing the investigation and pushing the Ukrainian government to reopen the case at a time when Biden emerged as the front-runner in the 2020 Democratic primary.
"We have two outstanding allegations of massive corruption," Giuliani said during a combative CNN interview Thursday evening, also referring to his belief that there was collusion between Ukrainian officials and the Hillary Clinton campaign to release damaging information about former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who is in prison for illegal lobbying and financial crimes.
Over the past few months, Giuliani has met with Ukrainian officials, encouraging them to investigate the two matters, including a meeting in Madrid with Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, that was set up by the State Department.
The former New York City mayor claims he has acted independently, informing Trump of his exploits months after he began. But the situation has drawn scrutiny by Democrats in Congress, who are investigating whether Trump and Giuliani improperly pressured the Ukrainian government by withholding funds unless they agreed to embark on an inquiry that could boost the president's reelection campaign.
A July call between Trump and Zelensky has become a flashpoint of concern as reports this week say Trump urged Zelensky roughly eight times to open an investigation into Hunter Biden, and their conversation is reportedly a subject of an intelligence community whistleblower complaint that the Trump administration is withholding from Congress.
In dismissing that he said anything wrong in his phone call with Zelenksy, Trump has accused the "fake news" media of not wanting to cover the Biden story.
Vogel agrees that there appears to a dearth of coverage and raised the prospect of a double standard.
"I got to say, if we were to just perform a thought exercise here and replace Joe Biden with Donald Trump and Hunter Biden with Eric Trump or Donald Trump Jr., we probably would be seeing more coverage of this story because I think that there is something here that does speak to at least optics, if not potential conflicts of interests," Vogel said Friday.
Vogel is not without his critics. His May 1 report received scrutiny because it was co-written with Iuliia Mendel, who went on to become Zelensky's press secretary. This prompted a stern rebuke from a Biden campaign adviser.
"The fact that the NYTs acted as a willing agent for the Trump White House’s lies and defended the paper’s publishing of them, makes this even more eyebrow raising. Have folks learned ANYTHING from the last presidential election?" Symone Sanders tweeted in June.
Vogel also drew outrage among left-leaning media figures after Trump tweeted out a montage of reporters discussing the Biden controversy on Saturday, including a clip of Vogel. "Congrats [Vogel] on the great work you’re doing for the Trump campaign!" Vox's Aaron Rupar tweeted, noting how the video serves as an advertisement for the Trump reelection campaign.
Tweet
Vogel admitted Friday that it is getting "complicated" to report the story because it is "impossible to separate the political motivation that the Trump folks have from what actually may be here in the facts of this situation."
But he stressed how his reporting has turned up evidence that high-level officials in the Obama State Department and other agencies raised "a red flag about Hunter Biden’s involvement with this gas company at a time when Joe Biden was the standard-bearer for the Obama administration’s case that Ukraine needed to clean up its act, including by investigating this gas company."
"I think there’s probably something there," he said.

DuPont painted as the villain in trailer for movie 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo plays a crusading lawyer looking for justice in the drama "Dark Waters," the trailer for which was released Wednesday. Ruffalo plays attorney Robert Bilott, who spent two decades building a case against DuPont for its role in the leak of perfluorooctanoic acid from a plant in Parkersburg, West Virginia.
DuPont and Chemours paid $671 million to settle more than 3,500 lawsuits that claimed they were to blame for the leak, also known as PFOA or C-8, from the plant. DuPont has used PFOA in the production of products such as Teflon.
Both companies denied wrongdoing.
The movie, directed by Todd Haynes ("Far From Heaven," "Carol") looks like it's squarely on the side of West Virginia residents and Bilott. And that makes DuPont the villain of the film.
That's not surprising considering it's based on a 2016 article from The New York Times titled "The lawyer who became DuPont's worst nightmare."
The trailer has hints of a thriller, including one moment that reads more like a mafia movie than a corporate drama. In it, Ruffalo gets into his car in an empty parking garage and hesitates before turning the engine, scared that his life might be threatened.
In the preview, audiences see Ruffalo connect with a West Virginia rancher whose cattle have been dying — and he's convinced it's because of tainted drinking water. Ruffalo becomes convinced and turns from corporate defense attorney to a crusader against DuPont. "DuPont is knowingly poisoning 70,000 local residents for the last 40 years," he tells his wife, played by Anne Hathaway.
The attorney he plays essentially transitions from Goliath to David. "They have all the money, all the firepower, and they'll use it. I know. I was one of them," Ruffalo's character says.
The movie comes out Nov. 22. Bilott also has a book coming out Oct. 8 about the case titled "Exposure: Poisoned Water, Corporate Greed, and One Lawyer's Twenty-Year Battle Against DuPont."
Attorney Rob Bilott's work is portrayed in "Dark Waters," set for release Nov. 22. The film is about the two decades he spent leading to a $671 million DuPont settlement after a West Virginia chemical leak.

Texto completo: Readers voice concern about possible improper conversations with a foreign leader and refusals to share details with Congress.
To the Editor:
Re "Claim on Trump Is Said to Involve a Foreign Leader" (front page, Sept. 20):
Donald Trump has said, "I have the right to do whatever I want as president." Indeed this is mostly true. The president not only has broad powers but he can even be spared legal consequences as long as he remains in office. This was made painfully clear in the Mueller investigation.
There are, however, red lines. The founding fathers did allow for congressional oversight and action in the event of a bad actor who would use the office of the presidency in service of himself rather than in service of the country. Now there is a whistle-blower in the intelligence community who has urgent information about the president that he believes Congress needs to know. It is information that Mr. Trump and the Justice Department would rather see withheld from Congress.
If speculations are true, and the president himself or through an emissary threatened to withhold vital military aid to Ukraine if it did not investigate business dealings of former Vice President Joe Biden's son or pursue a corruption investigation of Mr. Biden himself, that type of quid pro quo would be deeply troubling. It is the definition of politically self-serving.
Lawlessness is rampant in the Trump administration. If we want to restore the rule of law to our republic and faith in our democracy, we must insist that the whistle-blower be permitted to speak, come what may.

To the Editor:
The legacy of President Trump will be a field of horrors stretching to the horizon, but interrupted by a few bits of important insight into the flaws in our democracy.
Who would have thought a president would refuse to disclose his potentially conflicting business interests, then use his powers to enhance those very interests? Who would have thought that the nation's chief executive would dispatch a lackey to threaten his duly appointed attorney general with professional execution if he didn't reverse a principled decision? Who would have thought that in service of his re-election, the leader of the nation might have tried to enlist a foreign power to conduct an investigation of his likely political opponent?
Yes, one day we'll look back on these times with disgust, but it will be seasoned with a pinch of sardonic gratitude to the man who showed us where we might find the cracks in what we thought was the seamless wall of our democracy.

Parliament Of Chimps, Take Two?

Texto completo: A painting set to be offered at Sotheby's appears altered in some obvious ways. But the online catalog didn't mention that.
LONDON -- When Banksy's painting "Question Time," a satirical scene of chimps earnestly debating in the oak-paneled gloom of the British Parliament, appeared in an exhibition of the street artist's work at the Bristol Museum in 2009, it became an instant hit. More than 300,000 visitors attended the show, some of them lining up for seven hours to get in.
Just in time for Brexit, Sotheby's has announced the painting will be auctioned in London on Oct. 3. Banksy experts regard the work, which is 14 feet wide, as the finest Banksy painting ever to appear at auction, and Sotheby's estimates it will sell for 1.5 million to 2 million pounds, between $ 1.9 million and $ 2.5 million. That would be a salesroom high for the artist.
But keen-eyed Banksy aficionados have noticed unmistakable differences between the painting exhibited in 2009 and the one now for sale.
Once, the parliamentary chamber was brightly lit by two large hanging lamps. The lamps have now disappeared, giving a darker tonality to the painting.
There are other changes, too. In the left foreground of the work Sotheby's is selling, for instance, a seated chimp on the front bench holds a banana curved downward; in the 2009 version the banana is turned up. Nearby, a piece of decorative carving is a significantly different shape and size in the two versions.
Sotheby's online catalog description said that the painting was signed and dated 2009 and was the work that had appeared in the Bristol exhibition, and that the current owner had bought it from Banksy in 2011. The description did not make any mention of the differences, though it did say the work had a new title, "Devolved Parliament."
The auction house acknowledged the differences on Wednesday after being asked about them by The New York Times. Sotheby's said it was the same painting, but modified by Banksy since its original showing. The auction house added that it had been aware of the changes, but did not explain why they had not been mentioned in the catalog.
"This work was first created in 2009," Sotheby's said in a statement. "When, that same year, it was first exhibited at the Bristol Museum, it carried the title 'Question Time.' Since then, the painting has been reworked by the artist and more recently retitled," the statement said.
Certification by Pest Control, the artist's authentication bureau, assured Sotheby's and its clients that the painting offered for auction was the same one exhibited at the Bristol Museum in 2009, and that there were no other versions of this work, according to the statement.
But will Sotheby's statement reassure potential buyers and their advisers?
"My clients need to be satisfied that a work is unique and that there are no other versions. It needs to be clarified," said Acoris Andipa, a London dealer who specializes in Banksy paintings and prints.
"Ultimately this is about due diligence. If a question arises about a painting, nine times out of 10, there's a reasonable explanation, but it still always has to be explored," he said. He added he would only be convinced the painting was unique if he could examine the canvas himself using an ultraviolet light that would show up any reworkings.
When "Devolved Parliament" was displayed on loan in Bristol earlier this year, the museum made no mention of it being different from the painting it showed in 2009.
"This is not something that we are responding to, as we have no involvement in the matter," said David Paull, a senior public relations officer at Bristol City Council, which oversees the museum, in an email.
Also left unexplained is why Banksy would choose to alter the painting, and, if he did, when he did it. Huw Lougher, a dealer in contemporary prints, based in Bristol, who has been collecting Banksy works since 2006, said in an interview that the two-year gap between the 2009 exhibition and its acquisition by the present owner might explain the timing.
Did Banksy perhaps believe the original image had too bright an outlook on the state of British politics? Is that why the lights are now off and the telltale banana now curves down?
And was this all part of some stunt -- much like the one last October at Sotheby's, when one of his paintings sensationally shredded itself, after selling for $ 1.4 million?
"Banksy is a genius at playing the game, a genius at marketing," Mr. Lougher said. "He's built his career around publicity."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Friday that China was a "threat to the world" and suggested Beijing was eager to make a trade deal because his tariffs were hurting the Chinese economy, coarsening his tone as the two countries prepared to resume negotiations.
The Trump administration has closely tied economic policy and national security and, in remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said that China was using money pilfered from the United States through unfair trade practices to build up its military. The comments come as midlevel officials from both countries have been holding talks in Washington this week ahead of a planned meeting between senior trade negotiators next month.
"Obviously, China is a threat to the world in a sense, because they're building a military faster than anybody," Mr. Trump said. "I view China in many different ways. But right now, I'm thinking about trade. But, you know, trade equals military."
Mr. Trump also tried to put to rest speculation that he might settle for an interim deal to give markets a lift ahead of the presidential election next year.
"I'm looking for a complete deal, I'm not looking for a partial deal," Mr. Trump said during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia. "We're looking for the big deal."
Mr. Trump has imposed tariffs on $ 360 billion of Chinese goods and plans to tax nearly all imports from China by the end of the year. The president said that the tariffs have not had an impact on the United States economy, despite vocal complaints from American businesses, who say that their costs are going up and their supply chains are being disrupted.
Many of those businesses have applied to the United States Trade Representative for relief from the tariffs and, on Friday, the administration excluded hundreds of products from being taxed.
Those products include imported dog leashes, plastic straws and Christmas tree lighting sets.
Despite Mr. Trump's renewed criticism of China, the two countries have been taking steps to ease tension in recent weeks as they try to resolve a dispute that has cast a cloud over the global economy. China has recently allowed its companies to resume purchases of some American farm products after Mr. Trump agreed to delay increasing tariffs on another batch of Chinese imports by two weeks, to Oct. 15.
As part of a deal, China wants the United States to roll back the tariffs that it imposed and lift restrictions on American companies doing business with Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant. In addition to buying more American agricultural products, the United States wants China to make sweeping changes to its industrial policy, protect American intellectual property and open its market to American businesses.
But it remains evident that mending the relationship between United States and China will not happen easily.
During a speech in New York this week, Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador to the United States, squarely blamed the United States for the trade war.
"The trade war the U.S. launched and repeatedly escalated was based on a wrong rationale in the very beginning, and its negative impact has now hit both countries and spilled over to the whole world," he said.
A Chinese delegation, led by Minister of Agriculture Han Changfu, was planning to visit farms in Montana on Monday and Tuesday. But on Friday morning, the Montana Farm Bureau was alerted that the visit had been canceled because the group had to return early to China, according to Scott Kulbeck, director of membership development at the bureau.
On Friday, Mr. Trump insisted that even though the relationship between the United States and China has soured on his watch, he continues to have fond feelings for China's leader, Xi Jinping.
"My relationship with President Xi is a very amazing one, very good one," he said. "But we have right now a little spat."

Striking workers remind us that they saved GM

Texto completo: During the debate over whether the federal government should save the American auto industry in late 2008, a driver rammed into my old Saturn in a late-night accident while it was parked in front of my house. Fortunately, no one was hurt, but I needed a new car.
I strongly supported the rescue effort, so I felt an obligation to look to a Detroit-based car company organized by the United Auto Workers union for a replacement. I got a Chevy Malibu — my kids called it “Dad’s Boo” — and remain happy that I did.
In organizing what critics called the “bailout” of GM and Chrysler, President Obama was defying popular sentiment. Yet what was in many ways the most radical step he took to revive an American economy in free fall turned out to be one of his most politically beneficial initiatives.
The effort was far closer to what could be called “socialism” than anything in Obama’s health care plan, although he was, in fact, trying to keep the auto companies under private ownership. But socialism or not, the rescue was key to his success in 2012 in carrying Michigan and Ohio, states that would elude Hillary Clinton in 2016.
And it worked — witness GM’s $35 billion in North American profits over the last three years. The taxpayers got most of their money back and, by certain measures, even turned a modest profit off the government’s investment. Either way, a catastrophe was averted. It wasn’t just two big companies that were saved. So were suppliers whose collapse would have devastated the Midwest.
My support for the bailout was rooted in practical economic concerns: Our economy was teetering and could not afford the damage an auto-sector implosion would inflict. But my passion for it came from a concern for the lives of the workers involved and a lifelong respect for the UAW.
Unions get knocked for being unconcerned about the health of the companies they organize. The UAW showed how untrue this is. It made sweeping concessions to management to persuade federal officials to undertake the investment of public money — and to keep the companies alive.
Among other gripes is the tiered wage system that Neal Boudette described well in The New York Times: “Workers hired before 2007 make about $31 an hour, and can retire with a lifelong pension. Those hired after them (now more than a third of the work force) start at about $17 an hour and can work their way up to about $29 an hour over eight years. They also have to rely on 401(k) retirement accounts instead of pensions. In addition, GM uses temporary workers (about 7% of the staff) who earn about $15 an hour, and do not have vision or dental benefits.”
The rank-and-file don’t like the idea of people doing the same labor at radically different pay levels. And then there are the plant closures that have slashed 14,000 North American jobs, as well as the announcement that the Chevy Blazer would be built in Mexico.
Symbolically and substantively, the closure earlier this year of the legendary GM plant in Lordstown, Ohio, that had produced Chevy Cruzes was an especially heavy blow — and it flew in the face of President Trump’s promise in a 2017 speech in nearby Youngstown that factory jobs are “all coming back. They’re all coming back.” So confident was Trump that he told his supporters not to sell their homes.
The bottom line is that the strikers are fighting not only for greater fairness and a larger share of the company’s success, but also for work itself. Too late to avert the strike, GM finally put an offer on the table to begin addressing some of these issues. But the rank-and-file are restive for more, and for good reason. Those of us who supported keeping GM alive a decade ago — and put our wallets where our mouths, pens and votes were — didn’t do so to make it easier for management to outsource jobs or hold down pay and benefits forever. Every Democratic candidate for president should be joining the UAW’s picket lines to drive that point home.
The cliché is singularly appropriate in this case: The struggle for employment, pay and benefits in the auto industry is where the rubber meets the road in our too often very abstract discussion of the challenges facing American wage earners in an economy undergoing rapid transformation. The battle at GM is a fight that unions and workers cannot afford to lose.

Texto completo: President Trump will meet the president of Ukraine on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next week amid a swirl of controversy about a whistleblower complaint apparently related to a telephone call between the two leaders.
A senior administration official said Trump will meet Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday.
He declined to discuss the agenda other than to say Trump was expected to congratulate Zelensky on his election win this year.
Trump's communications with a foreign leader, in which he made a "promise," prompted an American intelligence officer to make a complaint in August to the inspector general for intelligence agencies.
The New York Times and the Washington Post later reported that the discussions were related to Ukraine.

Texto completo: The latest smear on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh is a disaster for Democrats, and everyone seems to know it except the party's presidential candidates.
No sooner had The New York Times published a new, unsubstantiated allegation of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh than most of the candidates demanded Kavanaugh's impeachment. "These newest revelations are disturbing," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter, adding, "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached." Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., declared Kavanaugh's "place on the Court is an insult to the pursuit of truth and justice. He must be impeached." Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Obama Housing Secretary Julián Castro and former congressman Beto O'Rourke joined in with impeachment calls of their own. Even former Vice President Joe Biden demanded Congress open an investigation and "follow the evidence to wherever it leads." That was considered the restrained response in the Democratic field.
Never mind that the supposed victim has told friends she has no recollection of the alleged incident; facts have never before stood in the Democrats' way when it comes to Kavanaugh. If the Democratic presidential contenders want to see Kavanaugh impeached, I say go for it. Open the investigation Biden has demanded. Start impeachment hearings. And broadcast it for all of America to see.
Let's remind voters of the disgraceful confirmation process Kavanaugh faced. Let's relive how Democrats accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting a teenage girl, exposing himself to a college classmate and participating in gang rapes at high school parties -- all without a shred of corroborating evidence. Let's rehash Christine Blasey Ford's allegations, but this time with the knowledge that the principal witness Ford named to her alleged assault, Leland Keyser, is now on record saying she does not believe Ford. Let's remind Americans how Senate Democrats denied Kavanaugh the presumption of innocence and insisted that the burden was on him to prove he was not a sex predator.
That sure worked out well for Democrats last time around. In 2018, the Kavanaugh debacle may have cost Democrats control of the Senate. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., and Claire McCaskill, D.-Mo., lost their seats thanks to voters disgusted by their party's campaign of character assassination against Kavanaugh, while Democrats blew a chance to pick up GOP seats in Tennessee and Texas. As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said at the time, the Kavanaugh hearings were "like an adrenaline shot" for the Republican base. Now, Democrats want to bring out the hypodermic needle for the 2020 elections. Sounds good to me.
On Capitol Hill, Democratic leaders know this is a path to disaster. In a stunning rebuke of his party's presidential contenders, Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told those calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment to "get real." "We've got to get beyond this 'impeachment is the answer to every problem,'" Durbin said. "It's become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you're unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. ... If that's how we are identified ... we run the risk that people will feel we're ignoring the issues that mean a lot to them as families." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was even more succinct. Asked if the House was going to investigate the new allegation, she said "no."
Durbin and Pelosi understand that the threats to impeach Kavanaugh are a godsend for Trump. And they come in the wake of Senate Democrats issuing an unprecedented threat to the other Supreme Court justices.
In a brief, they warned that if the high court does not rule as Democrats wish in a gun case, they could "restructure" the court when they take power in the 2020 elections -- packing it with liberal justices, flipping a 5-4 conservative majority to a liberal majority.
Democrats do not seem to realize that when they make threats like these, they are not hurting Kavanaugh or Trump, they are hurting themselves. The Washington Post reports that in 2016, "26% of Trump voters told pollsters that Supreme Court nominees were the most important factor in their voting, compared with only 18% of Hillary Clinton voters who said the same." As we have seen in the past two elections, when the Supreme Court is on the ballot, Democrats lose.
In other words, Democrats should not want voters to be thinking about Brett Kavanaugh or liberal court packing when they cast their ballots in 2020. Republicans should. So, let the impeachment proceedings begin.

NYT reporters say Kavanaugh agreed to be interviewed ‘if they wrote that they didn’t talk with him’

Texto completo: Two New York Times reporters who wrote a controversial piece about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s alleged sexual misconduct said he agreed to be interviewed off-the-record, but they had to write that they never spoke with him.
Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, the co-authors of the new book, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation, said Wednesday that they did not speak with Kavanaugh because they could not agree to the conditions.
"Brett Kavanaugh agreed to talk to @katekelly and @rpogrebin for their book — If they wrote that they didn't talk to him," National Press Club president Allison Kodjak tweeted. "The authors — who told the story tonight @PressClubDC — refused and walked away from the interview."
Tweet
The duo has come under fire for an excerpt from the book that detailed an allegation of sexual assault against Kavanaugh, who was accused of exposing himself to a college classmate at a party decades ago. The New York Times later updated the piece to note that the alleged victim told friends she did not recall the incident and that she declined to be interviewed.
Pogrebin and Kelly blamed the original omission on the editing process.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied the allegations against him during his combative confirmation hearing a year ago.

‘Fake news’ claim about Kavanaugh story shaky on facts

Texto completo: The conservative publication PJ Media says in a headline spreading virally on Facebook that the New York Times admitted a new allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh is fake news, but that is misleading.

The back-and-forth stems from a Sept. 14 report in the New York Times that contains a previously unreported accusation of sexual impropriety by Kavanaugh while a student at Yale.

After its initial reporting, the New York Times added more information to its story online and published an editors note explaining its decision.

Well walk through what changed in the Times story in a second. But it was not as PJ Media claimed in its headline, New York Times Now Admits New Kavanaugh Accusation Is Fake News.

On Sunday, The New York Times added a retraction to its story attacking Brett Kavanaugh, admitting that the female student allegedly assaulted had no recollection of the event. (Writers) Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly have egg on their faces, a blurb that ran alongside the PJ Media article reads.

PJ Medias managing editor Paula Bolyard told us that the PJ Media article was an opinion piece, and said that author Matt Margolis use of the phrase fake news was a rhetorical manner of expression. Bolyard noted that other outlets  among them CNN, the Hill and New York magazine referred to the New York Times update as a correction.

There are elements of opinion in PJ Medias post, but its important to know the Times did not retract or reverse its reporting, as PJ Medias headline suggests.

Error and update

The article in question was adapted from a forthcoming book by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation. The book delves into Kavanaughs background, including an alleged pattern of sexual misconduct that first came into public view around the time of Kavanaughs contentious October 2018 Supreme Court confirmation hearing.

The Sept. 14 New York Times article Brett Kavanaugh Fit In With the Privileged Kids. She Did Not ignited a firestorm, and even led to some Democratic presidential candidates calling for Kavanaughs impeachment.

It depicted a previously unreported scene in which Kavanaugh, then a Yale student in the 1980s, was said to have engaged in lewd conduct at a drunken dorm party. Heres how the account appears in the New York Times; the section in bold was added after the articles initial publication:

We also uncovered a previously unreported story about Mr. Kavanaugh in his freshman year that echoes Ms. Ramirezs allegation. A classmate, Max Stier, saw Mr. Kavanaugh with his pants down at a different drunken dorm party, where friends pushed his penis into the hand of a female student. Mr. Stier, who runs a nonprofit organization in Washington, notified senators and the F.B.I. about this account, but the F.B.I. did not investigate and Mr. Stier has declined to discuss it publicly. We corroborated the story with two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier; the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say she does not recall the episode.

And here is the editors note the New York Times published Sept. 15, explaining the change to its story:

An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the books account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hand of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.

Amid the fallout over its reporting, New York Times deputy editorial page editor James Dao published written answers to five questions from readers, including a question about why the Times decided to print an allegation that some viewed as insufficiently supported. Heres how Dao responded:

DAO: The essay included a previously unreported claim that friends pushed Mr. Kavanaughs penis into the hand of a female Yale student during a dorm party with drunken classmates. During the authors investigation, they learned that a classmate, Max Stier, witnessed the event and later reported it to senators and to the F.B.I. The authors corroborated his story with two government officials, who said they found it credible. Based on that corroboration, we felt mentioning the claim as one part of a broader essay was warranted.

New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha told PolitiFact the PJ Media headline is inaccurate, and added that the editors note is not a retraction in any way.

Dissecting the change

As the above text shows, the newpapers explanation may call Stiers allegation into question. But nowhere does the New York Times admit it peddled fake news, which gives the impression of having misled its readers.

Reporters Kelly and Pogrebin appeared on MSNBC and said the additional details were included in their original draft but were omitted as a result of an editing error. There was zero intent to mislead anybody about the details of the incident, Kelly said.

Ha, the New York Times spokeswoman, elaborated on this explanation. In the original article editors decided not to include some information about a female student at Yale that is provided in Kate Kelly and Robin Pogrebins book, including her name, in part to protect her privacy because she was not the source for the account in the adaptation, Ha told PolitiFact. After publication editors agreed with some readers that the adaptation should include the same information as the book, so the piece was updated.

The New York Times also did not retract the article or the specific allegation against Kavanaugh, as PJ Media said. A retraction would include removing the allegation entirely because it cannot be corroborated. The source of this allegation is Stier, a classmate of Kavanaughs.

In conclusion, the New York Times said it did not initially publish all relevant information when it ran the article, and the omitted information may call into question the credibility of the accusation. But the Times has since added that information, and wrote an editors note explaining their decision.

The New York Times has not retracted its reporting on the allegation or admitted it was incorrect. Sites claiming so have gone too far.

Texto completo: Bring on the hard-bitten dudes and hard-boiled plots. NOIR CITY DETROIT, the annual festival celebrating those stylish, steamy film noir crime tales Hollywood cranked out regularly in the 1940s and '50s, is taking a big step forward in 2019. The event, held since 2016 at the Redford Theatre, is partnering this year with the Detroit Film Theatre for an opening-night celebration Friday featuring screenings of early-'50s noir classics "Pickup on South Street" and "The Turning Point." Noted film noir buff Eddie Muller, host of TCM's "Noir Alley" programming, will be on hand for cocktails. Double-feature screenings continue Saturday and Sunday at the Redford.

A special feature this year is the Big Biergarten, held in the largest tent ever erected at Beacon Park and showcasing a wide variety of craft, Michigan and specialty brews.

The BRANFORD MARSALIS QUARTET, due in Detroit this weekend, came in for a fresh round of acclaim early this year with the release of new album "The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul."

A straight-A college student and diving champion with a goal of making the Olympic diving team cracks under pressure in the Michigan-made "COMING UP FOR AIR," which is having its world premiere Friday at Detroit's Redford Theatre. Directed by and starring Michigan natives Robert Cicchini and Chase Yi, the film focuses on how mental health affects families and is being released during National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It was shot in Ann Arbor and various western Michigan locations, including Grand Haven, Holland and Ludington.
7 p.m. Friday, (6 p.m. VIP), Redford Theatre, Detroit. 313-537-2560. redfordtheatre.com. $10, $35 VIP.
Good for thee but not for me. That's the sentiment that gets a comic skewering in playwright Joshua Harmon's "ADMISSIONS," which opens Friday at Ann Arbor's Theatre Nova. It centers on the smug, white and fiercely progressive Bill and Sherri, who have devoted their careers to diversifying the student body at the elite boarding school that employs them. Their tune changes quickly, however, when their son fails to win admission to the Ivy League college of his dreams. Local theater vets Diane Hill and Joe Bailey lead the Theatre Nova cast of a play the New York Times calls an "excruciating satire — of the left, by the left, for the left."
Opens at 8 p.m. Friday and continues through Oct. 13, Theatre Nova, Ann Arbor. 734-635-8450. theatrenova.org. $22.
Heads up, Lego enthusiasts. The BRICKWORLD LEGO EXPOSITION returns to Suburban Collection Showplace this weekend with two full days of activities for kiddies (and for the sizable number of Lego collectors who no longer qualify as kiddies).

Texto completo: [Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Steven Mnuchin, a former investment banker and hedge fund manager, began his career at Goldman Sachs after graduating from Yale. He was President Trump's national finance chairman, and as Treasury secretary has been a strong advocate for tax reform. Andrew Ross Sorkin, DealBook editor and columnist for The New York Times, interviewed Mr. Mnuchin at the Times's first DealBook/DC Strategy Forum. The following excerpts have been edited and condensed.
Mr. Secretary, what do you think it means to be a patriotic company in America today? And the reason we were talking about this is there are so many American companies in Silicon Valley that have historically done business with the U.S. government, but have become reticent. I don't know if you have a view that that's because they disagree with the administration. I don't know if you think it's an ethical or moral view. But how do you think business relates to the government now?
Well, I think in the United States we support private enterprise and private rights, and there's a whole spectrum in regards to how companies act. Obviously, companies have different constituencies, whether it's boards or shareholders or customers. And there's all different ways that companies can act with the government. It also depends on what industry you're in. There are certain industries where businesses get a lot of benefits from the government. So, clearly, I don't think it should be a one-way street. I think what you're touching on is a complicated issue. But I'd say, look, we believe in private enterprise, and we believe in a capitalistic society.
Well, let me ask you about another related issue to this -- about the way the government assigns contracts or doesn't to U.S. enterprises. I'm going to give you an example. There's a question now about whether Amazon, Amazon Web Services, is going to get the $ 10 billion Pentagon contract. And there's a view that politics are involved in that, and that's why I'm trying to get at that core of how you think those things come together.
Let me just say some of these issues are very complicated, and I don't think in any way they're as simple as political issues. I can't comment on the specifics of the Department of Defense contract. I can tell you that the idea of using the cloud and using external vendors is something that's very important for the government. On the other hand, I think from the government standpoint we need to balance these risks, specifically in industries where there are very few providers of the services, with what dependence the government ultimately has since when we move these things, these are long-term relationships. But I can assure you this is way beyond a political issue.
I think another complex issue on Amazon is you have one of the largest cloud providers attached to a giant retailer. So I mean, one of the questions is, who knows what Amazon looks like 10 years down the road. Are they still attached or are they not attached?
O.K., this is a hard one for you. Your boss goes on Twitter and calls the leader of Amazon Jeff "Bozo." What do you think when you see that?
Look, the president going back to the campaign came up with some very creative names for people. So I think people understand how he uses these names.
In practice, as part of this larger negotiation that's going on every single day, do you call him and say, I really wish you hadn't said that?
There's lots of things on policies and everything else that I talk to the president about. I really don't get into these issues.
I have a different one for you, but related. I don't know if you saw this earlier this week, Elliott Management, the activist firm, decided they were going to go after AT&T; and the president put out a Tweet saying great news, an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the Treasury secretary, somebody who deals with business every day, how do you think about that?
I think it's always creative if investors get more involved with companies. I think one of the biggest problems we have is that boards are not active enough, that large shareholders are not active enough. We have a huge amount of assets going into index funds, so I think shareholders should be well represented.
That's actually very interesting, because there's a view, especially when it comes to this idea that people need to be more long-term thinking, that actually activist shareholders have not been helpful.
I think quite the opposite. Look at a Warren Buffett. He's a very, very long-term shareholder. He's as much an activist as other people.
Why would you say Mr. Buffett would be an activist in that way?
In the sense he's focused on long-term values and long-term creation.
But the view is that activists come in and make some trouble.
That's your view. You're categorizing how you refer to an activist.
So how do you?
You're using it in what I consider to be more of a derogatory term, as opposed to an activist could be an active investor. Obviously, private equity is definitely an active investor. So, I mean, private equity buys companies because they think they can run them better.
I'm going to pivot the conversation. We actually had a big debate about taxes just now. One of the questions that was raised was this idea that we need more revenue. If you look at the deficit, as you very well know, it looks like it's going to get over a trillion dollars for 2020 for the first time. So given that there are conversations about a tax cut, how do you raise more revenue right now?
The No. 1 way you raise more revenue is through growth. So I think when we look at debt and sustainability, we look at debt relative to G.D.P. I think that when the president came into office, the No. 1 economic issue he was focused on was growing the economy. For a long time we had very low growth. There were people who said we could never grow at high numbers again. We had wages that hadn't grown, and we came with an economic plan and said, "Look, you can't cut your way to prosperity. You have to grow your way," and again, we've grown revenues now. One of the things we did in the tax bill was we allowed for automatic expensing. So, obviously that is a front-loading of investment and a back-end in terms of revenues. So part of this is when you look at the deficit you can't just look at a moment in time, you have to look at what are we going to do over a five- or 10-year period.
You said initially -- when they were campaigning before the tax plan -- that it would pay for itself.
I still think it will absolutely.
We're ahead of where we thought we'd be today. I never said I thought it would pay for itself in year one. What I said is over a 10-year window, which is the way we analyze taxes, it will pay for itself. And again, this is just math. If over this 10-year window we grow an extra 35 basis points a year, it will have paid for itself.
How worried are you about interest rates now in this country and specifically what's happening in Europe and what it may ultimately mean here -- the power of the dollar and everything else?
In my role as Treasury secretary, I'm not going to specifically comment on interest rates in the United States. But I will comment on interest rates in Europe. I think that low interest rates are good for economic growth. I think that negative interest rates are bad for a banking business. It's hard to grow an economy without having a healthy banking business.
Let me ask you a different question then. C.E.O.s in America wrote a letter to senators saying pass the bill on gun violence. Walmart just a couple of weeks ago decided that it was no longer going to stock certain types of products -- ammunition and other things like that. Do you think this is what business should be doing?
I think you're talking about two different things. One is you're talking about businesses writing to Congress about certain positions, which, again, I think in general, people have the right to have their opinions. I think there's a complicated issue that Congress is looking at.
It's just interesting to me because Citigroup, Bank of America and some others last year decided that they were trying to distance themselves from gun manufacturers. And when they did that they got a lot of attaboys from some customers. And there were other customers who are upset. But, interestingly, this is where the political part of it becomes so unique. There were lawmakers in certain states who effectively went after some of these companies.
Well, again, these are complicated issues. You're talking about banks that are regulated and have F.D.I.C. insurance, which is a benefit. I think it's not the role of banks to discriminate against any laws. So I think part of the pushback specifically on banks is part of a broader view, which is if all of a sudden banks start picking "we like these laws, we don't like those laws," you lead to discrimination. Banks have a different obligation because they take insurance from the government.
I have one final very quick question for you about TV. There's a whole new streaming war that's coming, as you know, between Apple with their Plus service and Disney Plus and Amazon and Netflix. You want to pick a winner?
You know I'm not allowed to pick a winner, so I can't comment on that because that would be endorsing something. But I will say, I think it's terrific there's this type of competition.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Amid a continued shake-up at the Department of Homeland Security, its general counsel John Mitnick, has been fired.
“We thank John for this service, and we wish him well,” a DHS spokesperson told the New York Times Tuesday night.
The DHS has seen a number of high-profile departures in recent months, including its former secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen and acting deputy secretary Claire Grady. The department oversees President Trump’s immigration agenda and has been the target of lawsuits targeting the administration’s immigration policies.
According to an administration official, Mitnick’s firing was reportedly pushed by the White House general counsel’s office and not senior adviser Stephen Miller, who promoted the previous DHS ousters. Despite that, two people briefed on the firing said that the counsel’s office actually tried to keep Mitnick in the role.
A DHS official said that Joseph Maher, the department’s principal deputy general counsel, would take over from Mitnick.

Data shows abortion rate is at lowest since 1973

Texto completo: Abortion in the United States has decreased to record low levels, a decline that may be driven more by increased access to contraception and fewer women becoming pregnant than by the proliferation of laws restricting abortion in some states, according to new research.
“Abortion rates decreased in almost every state, and there’s no clear pattern linking these declines to new restrictions,” said Elizabeth Nash, senior state policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, which issued the findings in a report and policy analysis Wednesday. The institute, which supports abortion rights, periodically compiles abortion data by surveying hospitals and abortion clinics, and by reviewing information from health departments and other sources.
The institute estimated that there were about 862,000 abortions in 2017, nearly 200,000 fewer than in 2011. The abortion rate — the number of abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age — dropped to 13.5 in 2017 from 16.9 in 2011, the lowest rate since abortion became legal nationwide in 1973.
The report suggests that one reason for the decrease might be the growing use of long-term contraceptive methods, like intrauterine devices and implants, which are covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Birthrates have also declined.
“If restrictions were the main driver across the board, we’d expect birthrates to increase,” said Nash, a writer of the policy analysis.
She said that in the four states that enacted new restrictions between 2011 and 2017, the number of abortions actually rose. More than half the decline in the number of abortions during that time happened in states that did not pass restrictive abortion laws, she said.
The research does not cover the period from 2018 on, when several conservative states passed especially stringent laws that would effectively ban most abortions — laws that are being challenged in court. But during the time frame of the research, 2011 to 2017, 32 states passed a total of 394 abortion restrictions, the authors say.
The authors said that one category of state restrictions — those that create hurdles for abortion providers by requiring hospital affiliations and other criteria — did result in many clinics closing in states like Texas and Ohio. But because new clinics opened in the Northeast and the West, the overall number of clinics in the country grew slightly, Rachel Jones, the Guttmacher Institute’s principal research scientist, said.
And even in states where the number of clinics increased, abortions declined.
The authors said the abortion ratio — the number of abortions out of 100 pregnancies that ended either in abortion or live birth — was 18.4 in 2017, down from 21.2 in 2011. The researchers did not explain whether that drop reflected an increase in the number of women who wanted to give birth or who wanted an abortion but did not have access to one, or a combination of both.
The research also found that medication abortion — a nonsurgical method that allows women who are 10 weeks pregnant or less to induce an abortion by taking two medications — is transforming the abortion landscape. An estimated 60% of women who were early enough in pregnancy chose to use abortion pills in 2017, the authors reported, and the pills accounted for 39% of all abortions that year. Nearly a third of clinics in 2017 offered only medication abortion.
The Guttmacher Institute would not allow journalists to share the actual research with anyone before publication, but people on both sides of the abortion divide commented on the overall conclusions.
Clarke Forsythe, senior counsel for Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion organization, called the research “a patchwork put together to serve an agenda, and I don’t give any of it any credence whatsoever.”
Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the research, said the reasons behind the abortion decline are probably complex.
“While the authors did not find a clear association among the change in the number of clinics, legal restrictions and changes in the abortion rate in these national data, I think a more nuanced analysis is needed,” said Grossman, who conducts reproductive health research and also performs abortions.

BLAIR BRAVERMAN TALKS MUSHER CULTURE AND HOW TO DRESS WHEN IT'S COLD; COVER STORY

Texto completo: Author Blair Braverman builds her positive, enthusiastic fan base the same way she trains her Alaskan Husky sled dogs. (This does not involve kibble.)
"It's basic behaviorism," Braverman said. "You reward things you want to see and you ignore things you don't want to see. If we see someone starting drama, we just don't go near it. We don't engage."
Braverman shared thoughts about musher culture, how to dress when it's "chilly" (-10 or lower) and a few dozen adorable dog photos onstage in Music Hall Saturday afternoon at the third annual Cap Times Idea Fest.
Braverman, author of the memoir "Welcome to the Goddamn Ice Cube" (Ecco, 2016), is used to sharing snapshots of her life in Mountain, Wisconsin, with a highly engaged online community that loves her photogenic #uglydogs.
Her interviewer on Saturday, political columnist and culture critic Ana Marie Cox, has built her own dedicated following. Cox is the founder of Wonkette and the Columbia Journalism Review's public editor for The Washington Post. Among other credits, Cox wrote the Talk column for the New York Times Magazine for two years.
Through Crooked Media, Cox hosts a podcast, "With Friends Like These." The hour-long chat with Braverman, once edited for clarity, will be a future episode of the podcast.
Braverman and her husband, Quince Mountain, are "the human parts" of BraverMountain Mushing, and they currently feed 26 dogs. "How many dogs do you feed?" is how the way you have to ask, Braverman said.
"If someone asks how many dogs you have, mushers'll be like, well, I have nine dogs on my team and these retirees," Braverman said, "and I have two puppies but one of the puppies I'm raising for my friend, and three foster dogs are staying here ... you just divide it all up, 'cause you're thinking of them as individuals."
Braverman said the dog sledding community is pretty different beyond "the bubble of mushing we've created for ourselves." The sport is largely self-taught and not cohesive, Braverman said, forged by mushers helping each other. Early on, she realized that none of the male mushers were going to come and tell her she was one of them. She had to live the life herself, with all the layers of clothing and self-reliance that entailed.
Mushers "like to be in the wilderness with dogs," she said. "We don't necessarily like other people."
Yet competing in a punishing, potentially life-threatening race like the 938-mile Alaskan Iditarod bonds people to each other who might not vote the same in an election.
"When you're out on the trail together, you're all on the same team," Braverman said. "Mushers aren't allowed outside help during a race, but they can help each other. ... Mushing is about solving problems. The last thing you're thinking about is someone's politics."
A recurring theme in Braverman and Cox's conversation on Saturday was how relating to dogs connects to relating to people.
"It's sometimes easier for us to be generous of spirit to animals than it is to be generous of spirit to people," Cox said. She tells listeners sometimes, "if you're fighting with your Trump-loving uncle, go walk some dogs together."
While Braverman and Cox talked, the stars of Braverman's Twitter feed sweet, clingy Flame, her sister Jenga, Spike with his "very big head," Wickson and Pepé and Helli flipped by on a slide show behind them.
There were dogs being skritched, dogs scruffing in the snow, dogs riding piggyback or collapsed on Braverman after a race. Sometimes they wore jaunty pink booties. In one shot, Flame, dressed as Rosie the Riveter in a long-sleeved shirt and a red bandana, touched noses with Summer, a little white cat.
This, Cox explained, was bonus visual content, just for attendees of the live podcast.
"This amazing internet community has changed our lives," Braverman said. "People help each other. It's like wow how did all these good people find this dog team?"

Texto completo: Representative Joseph P. Kennedy plans to officially announce he's mounting a primary challenge to Senator Edward J. Markey on Saturday, the Globe reported Wednesday. He joins the field as the most high-profile of three declared challengers.
There are many months ahead before Massachusetts voters go to the polls in September 2020, but here's a look at where things stand as the race officially heats up.
Polls In a recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll, Kennedy had a major head start, leading Markey 35 percent to 26 percent among likely Democratic voters in a five-way race. If the race were narrowed to a head-to-head matchup, Kennedy's lead would grow even more, expanding to 14 points. The poll, which had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points, found Kennedy led Markey among every age group and across wide geographic swaths of the state.
The poll did not find a clear policy priority among respondents, who said everything from the economy and jobs (14 percent), climate change and the environment (13 percent), education (10 percent), and health care (10 percent) were important to them in electing a senator.
Endorsements Markey began rolling out endorsements of his reelection bid early. Just days after the New York Times reported Kennedy was considering a run for the seat, Markey released a video of Senator Elizabeth Warren promising her “full support" of Markey's reelection. Warren said she first endorsed Markey in February.
The Globe polled the state's congressional delegation in August, and found, in addition to Warren, Representatives Richard Neal, Jim McGovern, Stephen Lynch, Bill Keating, and Lori Trahan were backing Markey's bid for the party's Senate nomination.
Notably absent from the list was Representative Ayanna Pressley, who mounted her own primary challenge of an incumbent Democrat in 2018, and Representative Katherine Clark. Both have remained silent so far on the race.
Another high-profile Democrat, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, announced her endorsement of Markey on Friday.
Markey has also received the support of more than 100 state lawmakers.
Fund-raising Kennedy comes into the race with a couple of advantages when it comes to raising cash for what is sure to be a hard-fought, expensive race.
He developed a reputation for being a prolific fund-raiser for Democrats around the country in recent election cycles, and the Globe reported Monday that Kennedy's willingness to show up and campaign for even long-shot Democrats has earned him goodwill among many Democrats.
Still, some Democrats recently told the Globe they don't want to see an expensive intraparty fight that directs much-needed resources to what is (usually) a reliably blue state.
“The most frustrating thing about any primary is that it sucks resources from candidates in competitive races elsewhere," said Steve Israel, former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House.
As it stands now, Markey has $4.1 million cash on hand, while Kennedy holds a slight edge at $4.2 million, according to the most recent federal data through June.
The relatively young congressman may also have another advantage: His father's $2.8 million campaign account, which remains open despite the fact that Joseph P. Kennedy II has not served in Congress since 1999.
A campaign finance watchdog told the Globe earlier this month that Kennedy could legally spend cash from his campaign account on television ads and mailers supporting his son as long as he didn't coordinate directly with the campaign.
Issues you'll be hearing about As the campaign officially gets underway, expect to hear a lot about the policy ground each candidate is trying to stake out for themselves: Markey has made environmental issues a major part of his legislative career and recently cosponsored a resolution outlining the Green New Deal with freshman Ocasio-Cortez. Markey has also focused on telecommunications issues such as net neutrality rules and consumer advocacy.
For his part, Kennedy frequently touts his commitment to LGBTQ rights and was an early supporter of Massachusetts' efforts to ban discrimination against transgender individuals in public facilities. He's also made access to mental health care a key issue in his congressional career.
There are already signs the matchup could be a hard-fought, messy campaign. In August, a top Markey campaign aide shared an ugly tweet referencing mental health issues in the Kennedy family in the wake of the death of 22-year-old Saoirse Kennedy Hill.
The aide, Paul Tencher, immediately apologized, calling the tweet “despicable and abhorrent." Tencher has since moved on from the Markey campaign.

Texto completo: New York Times bestselling author, actor, producer and director Henry Winkler will be in Naperville next month to discuss his new "Alien Superstar" middle-grade series of books.
Winkler and his writing partner, Lin Oliver, will sign copies of the book at 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 4, at Naperville’s Community Christian Church, 1635 Emerson Lane.
The appearance is sponsored by Anderson’s Bookshop in downtown Naperville. For tickets, visit AlienSuperstarAndersons.brownpapertickets.com.
Winkler, who first gained fame as the Fonz in TV’s "Happy Days," added author to his list of achievements in 2003 as he co-authored his critically-acclaimed Hank Zipzer series of children’s books.
Inspired by his own experiences, Winkler, whose undiagnosed dyslexia made him a classic childhood underachiever, shared his tales of a high-spirited and funny boy with learning differences. He paired with author and TV and film writer Oliver to launch that popular series for middle grade readers.
Now the team hopes to replicate their children’s literature success with their new "Alien Superstar" series.
Winkler last visited an Anderson’s Bookshop event in 2014 when the writing duo was featured at Anderson’s Annual Young Adult Conference.
In their new book, no one is shocked by the six-eyed alien strolling around the Universal back lot. The tourists think he’s part of the show.
It doesn’t take long for Buddy to land a role on a popular TV show, playing (of course) an alien. He becomes an overnight heartthrob and is suddenly faced with legions of adoring fans, rides in glamorous limos, and appearances at "all-the-shrimp-you-can-eat" red carpet parties. But can Buddy maintain his secret identity while in the spotlight?
Winkler is an Emmy award-winning actor, writer, director and producer who has created some of the most iconic TV roles, including Gene Cousineau in "Barry."
Oliver is currently the executive director of the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As several Democratic presidential candidates called for the impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, newly disclosed allegations are reviving questions about the rush to confirm him.
The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh last October after emotional hearings over an allegation of a sexual assault from his high school years. The vote provided a signature achievement for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, fulfilling a long-held Republican desire to pack the Supreme Court with conservatives.
The New York Times reported over the weekend that Kavanaugh faced a separate allegation from his time at Yale University and that the FBI did not investigate the claim. Still, many Democrats are reluctant to reprise the controversy that likely cost the party Senate seats in the midterm elections.
McConnell opened the Senate on Monday saying the new round of allegations against Kavanaugh "felt a little like Groundhog Day."
While impeachment proceedings against Kavanaugh are extremely unlikely, the revelations raise fresh questions about the GOP rush to push Kavanaugh’s confirmation.
The latest claim in the Times is similar to one offered during Kavanaugh’s confirmation process by Deborah Ramirez, a Yale classmate who claimed Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party. Kavanaugh declined to comment Monday through the court’s press office, but in Senate testimony last year, he flatly denied all allegations of misconduct.
On Monday, The Associated Press learned that one Democratic senator had raised concerns to the FBI as agents were investigating.
Delaware Sen. Chris Coons asked the FBI on Oct. 2 to speak with "one individual I would like to specifically refer you to for appropriate follow up," according to a letter obtained by the AP.
The senator’s letter does not spell out the allegations, and the person’s name is redacted. But a person familiar with the letter confirmed Coons was referring to Max Stier, a Yale classmate of Kavanaugh’s who is the person cited in the newspaper story.
The Times said that the female student in the latest claim declined to be interviewed and that friends said she doesn’t recall the episode. The newspaper said Sunday in an editor’s note that an earlier version of its story didn’t include that information.
Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tweeted, "As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I promise you Justice Kavanaugh will not be impeached over these scurrilous accusations."

They, themself: Merriam-Webster adds nonbinary pronouns to dictionary. Also added: vacay, deep state

Resumen: The latest edition of the Merriam-Webster dictionary adds terms such as "they" and "themself" as singular pronouns.

Enlaces: https://upfinder.upf.edu/openurl/34CSUC_UPF/34CSUC_UPF:VU1?genre=article&amp;atitle=They%2C+themself%3A+Merriam-Webster+adds+nonbinary+pronouns+to+dictionary.+Also+added%3A+vacay%2C+deep+state&amp;author=Ortiz%2C+Jorge+L&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;date=2019-09-17&amp;rft.btitle=&amp;rft.jtitle=USA+Today+%28Online%29&amp;issn=&amp;isbn=&amp;sid=ProQ%3Anorthcentralnews_

Texto completo: The next time someone expresses a preference for a plural pronoun, the dictionary will be there to provide support.
As the notion of gender fluidity becomes more prevalent, nonbinary pronouns have emerged as an option for those who don’t want to be identified strictly as male or female.
The Merriam-Webster dictionary recognizes that usage by incorporating “they" and “themself" in references to “a single person whose gender identity is nonbinary. "
Those are among 533 new words and meanings in the dictionary’s latest update, released Tuesday, including terms such as “dad joke" and “vacay. "
Singer Sam Smith is among those who have said publicly they identify themselves as nonbinary and have opted for the pronouns “they" and “them. "
For those who may find that jarring, Merriam-Webster senior editor Emily Brewster pointed out the word “they’’ has been used commonly for centuries in the singular form as an indefinite pronoun. For example: “If someone doesn’t like it, they can leave. ’’
“In more recent years, we have this nonbinary ‘they,’ which is now appearing in carefully edited text," Brewster told USA TODAY. “It’s appearing in The New York Times. It is being chosen by people and mentioned in articles with some frequency. It’s simply not a usage that can be ignored anymore. "
Previous additions: Dictionary. com adds words: Smexy, womyn, yaldi and birb – but what do they mean?
Nonbinary terms make up a small portion of the interesting additions to the dictionary. The folks at Merriam-Webster highlighted entries in several other areas, including:
Sports and games
Pickleball: A newly popular court sport played with short-handled paddles and a perforated plastic ball.
Escape room: A game in which participants confined to a room or an enclosed setting are given a set amount of time to find a way to escape.
In April, the dictionary added the popular term “garbage time," referring to “the final moments or minutes of a game in which one side has an insurmountable lead. "
Pop culture
Stinger: A short scene that appears during or after the closing credits of a movie.
Coulrophobia: An abnormal fear of clowns.
Politics and law
Deep state: An alleged secret governmental network operating extra-legally.
Red flag law: A law that allows courts to prevent people who show signs of being a danger to themselves or others from having access to firearms.
Singer's words: Sam Smith says he is 'nonbinary, genderqueer,' describes 'war within'
Abbreviated terms such as “vacay" for vacation, “sesh" for session and “inspo" for inspiration also found their way into this latest edition of the M-W dictionary.
“We are always (striving) to reflect the established language," Brewster said. “There’s always been the criticism that we are too permissive, but it was scandalous in 1961 that we entered the word ‘finalize,’ and no one really blinks much of an eye at that anymore. "

But first, yikes: Only two labs in the entire world keep a live smallpox virus sample. The one in Russia just had an explosion. ��
Who gave Edward Snowden’s new book a terrible review?
The U. S. government, probably. Renegade former CIA and NSA employee Edward Snowden, who tells it like he thinks in his new book, is being sued. The Justice Department filed suit Tuesday, saying Snowden's memoir, "Permanent Record," which was released Tuesday, violates nondisclosure agreements he signed. Snowden – hailed as hero, trashed as traitor – says he never took an oath of secrecy, he took an oath to defend the Constitution "from all enemies, foreign and domestic. " The book details his dash out of the country six years ago after he leaked information on how the NSA conducted surveillance on the U. S. public. He has been living in Russia in exile, approved by Russian President Vladimir Putin, ever since. Snowden says he does not regret his actions but wants to return to the USA for a "fair trial. "
Did Kevin Hart conspire to release a sex tape?
Kevin Hart’s not having the greatest year. Hart faces a $60 million lawsuit after model and actress Montia Sabbag accused the comedian of negligence, infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy stemming from a 2017 incident, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY. Sabbag made headlines with Hart in September 2017 after a video of the two having sex in a hotel room was released online. In a lawsuit filed Monday, she alleges that Hart worked with another person named in the suit to record her in an attempt to gain publicity for his comedy tour, which began days before the video went public.

‘Cancer is mysterious in more ways than one’
“Jeopardy!” host Alex Trebek is undergoing chemotherapy again after a setback in his battle with pancreatic cancer. Trebek said Tuesday that after a short period of optimism when he stopped chemo, his numbers shot up, and doctors ordered him back on the treatment. "I was doing so well," he explained. “I lost about 12 pounds in a week, and my numbers went sky high. Much higher than they were when I was first diagnosed. " The 79-year-old game show host announced in March that he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. "Cancer is mysterious in more ways than one," Trebek said. Despite his battle with cancer, he hasn’t missed a single day on the show.
Veteran journalist Cokie Roberts will be missed
Trailblazing journalist Cokie Roberts, whose Emmy-winning career earned her top-tier journalism awards, died from complications from breast cancer. She was 75. "Our dear friend and colleague Cokie Roberts passed away this morning in Washington, surrounded by her family and closest friends," ABC News President James Goldston said. The office of Barack Obama issued a statement after news of Roberts' passing: "She was a trailblazing figure; a role model to young women at a time when the profession was still dominated by men," the statement read.

In Bermuda, strengthening Category 2 Hurricane Humberto is approaching and will probably track near the tiny island by Wednesday, according to the Weather Channel. Yet another system – Tropical Depression Ten – formed Tuesday in the central Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane center said. The system should become Tropical Storm Jerry in the next day or so and track north of the Caribbean as a hurricane by the weekend.

Texto completo: The city's Public Design Commission has pushed back its vote on a women's suffrage monument proposed for Central Park, despite concerns that a delay could jeopardize plans to unveil it on a historic anniversary next August.
Monumental Women - the nonprofit working to bring the statue of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Sojourner Truth to the park - hopes to unveil it during a ceremony on Aug. 26, 2020 - the centennial of the day the 19th Amendment went into effect.
The group has already secured the Parks Department's approval for the monument but still needs a majority vote from the design commission to move forward.
At a public hearing on Monday, however, the commission voted unanimously to table its vote, "with an intent to move forward as quickly as possible," its president Signe Nielsen said. She cited the need for input from historians as well as letters from local community boards in support of an updated rendering of the statue.  
The proposed monument, which originally included just Stanton and Anthony, was modified to include Truth last month after advocates criticized it for failing to recognize any suffragists of color.
"I do think we cannot have a statue of two white women representing the vote for all women," activist Gloria Steinem told the New York Times in January.
The current proposal for the statue features Truth sitting with Stanton at a table inside the latter's home, with Anthony standing behind them carrying "documentation of injustices" in her traveling bag, artist Meredith Bergmann said in a statement.
But the announcement about the updated monument, too, drew criticism. Nearly two dozen scholars, including Harlem Historical Society director Jacob Morris, signed a letter in August claiming a statue showing the three activists working together "could obscure the substantial differences between white and black suffrage activists, and would be misleading."
However, during testimony prior to the commission's vote, Washington Street Advocacy Group president Todd Fine read testimony on behalf of Morris, who criticized Monumental Women for keeping renderings of the new statue from the public until Monday's hearing but didn't criticize the statue itself. 
The Harlem Historical Society had "no objection to the fundamental features of the design," Morris wrote.
"For the purposes of civic and societal unity and pride it is understandable that the statue fund would want to represent a 'kumbaya' moment of togetherness," he wrote, adding that Bergmann's design was "sensitive to the critiques" that had been expressed previously.
A plaque on the pedestal below the statue, Morris argued, should provide "sufficient historical context" regarding the "different objectives" of black and white suffrage activists.
In addition to asking Monumental Women to submit letters of support from the community boards as well as "independent opinions" from historians that speak to the accuracy of the monument, Nielsen also noted the commission had minor "aesthetic concerns" about the statue itself that still need to be addressed. If those issues are resolved within the next month, the commission will put the monument on its consent agenda for approval, she said.
"I am in complete support of the concept and initiative of a statue to monumental women," Nielsen explained.
"We do not want to delay this any further," she added. "[But] we do have to point out to members of the public that there have been several changes along the way here not requested specifically by our commission, that has been part of the reason for some of the delay."
Despite the controversy the proposed statue has stirred, nobody at the meeting raised concerns about the monument's design.
Approximately 15 other attendees - including Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, several members of Monumental Women and a representative for Rep. Carolyn Maloney - testified in support.
Monumental Women board member Brenda Berkman, a retired FDNY captain who was the sole named class plaintiff in a sex discrimination lawsuit that compelled the FDNY to start hiring female firefighters, said she'd seen how "images of strong historic women can inspire young women to be brave in their own lives."
"For me, history is both living and important," she said.
After the commission tabled its vote, Monumental Women board member Namita Luthra said she was confident the group would secure community board support, adding that members were "hoping for a very quick resolution."
Monumental Women's president Pam Elam, meanwhile, told amNewYork she wasn't surprised by the commission's decision.
"To be totally honest, we expected them to do this. It's just another delay," she said.
"[But] we persist," she added. "And we will not stop until that beautiful statue stands on the mall in Central Park, and all of the millions of people who see it will just honor those women, and hopefully feel energized to complete the journey that they started for full equality for women."

Andrew Yang gets why Trump won

Texto completo: Andrew Yang is not going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2020. He knows that, too.
Yang somehow made the cut to participate in last week's third Democratic debate, clearing the fundraising and polling thresholds. But he did little to convince viewers who remained alert throughout that three-hour marathon that he will be a factor in the primaries. So I'm not writing this to suggest that the political oddsmakers should be taking Yang's dark-horse candidacy more seriously, or that Yang would be getting more respect if the average Democratic voter were as farsighted as he is.
I simply want to acknowledge that he is the only candidate talking about an issue likely to loom larger in presidential campaigns to come, and suggest that critics who scoff at his signature proposal for a universal basic income may feel compelled to examine it more closely in the decade ahead -- especially if Yang's forecast of an artificial intelligence-induced tsunami of unemployment proves prescient.
Yang's candidacy is interesting not because of his unusual r sum , which includes no prior political experience, but because he has offered what might be the simplest and most useful explanation of how Donald Trump came to be president. The conventional wisdom, as Yang summarizes it, is that Trump's ascent was the perfect storm spawned by the convergence of racism, Russian cyber-kibitzing and hostility toward Hillary Clinton.
His explanation is simpler.
"I'm a numbers guy," Yang said in a New York Times' "The Daily" podcast, "and the numbers tell a very clear and distinct story that the reason why he's our president is that we automated away 4million manufacturing jobs in your home state of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan -- all the swing states you needed to win."
As Yang sees it, that represents only the prelude to a coming unemployment crisis that will leave tens of millions of Americans working in a much broader swath of industries without jobs by the end of the next decade.
My son, a hardworking entrepreneur with only a marginal interest in politics but a keen eye for the zeitgeist, likes to warn me that America's next bloody revolution will come when autonomous vehicles begin supplanting the 3.5 million truck drivers, whose livelihood is the most common occupation in more than half of the 50 states.
Yang agrees.
"The replacement of drivers will be one of the most dramatic, visible battlegrounds between automation and the human worker," he writes in a recent essay for the Evonomics website. "Companies can eliminate the jobs of call center workers, retail clerks, fast-food workers and the like with minimal violence and fuss. Truck drivers will be different."
If you know anything at all about Yang's quixotic candidacy, it's probably that he proposes to address that crisis by using the proceeds of a value-added tax on corporate profits to bankroll a $1,000-a-month "freedom-dividend" for every American adult. It's being taken about as seriously as fellow dark-horse Marianne Williamson's proposal to "harness love" to bring about a spiritual transformation of government.
Yang has used his own money to underwrite monthly stipends for a small number of recipients in an effort to test his theories. I admire that initiative, but many dismissed his Thursday night pledge to expand the test (to 10lucky families chosen at random) as a stunt, or even a violation of election law. But it's easy to imagine voters giving his proposal a second look when lawyers, teachers, truck drivers and grocery store cashiers are being sidelined en masse by automation.
Yang deserves our attention because he is focusing on issues -- artificial intelligence, automation and their ever-more-profound impact on employment -- that will likely become central to the lives of more and more Americans in the decade ahead, whether or not voters hold Trump to one term. The more accurate Yang's unemployment forecasts prove, the harder it will be for his detractors to ignore him.

What now with Kavanaugh?

Texto completo: There are two kinds of people in this country today: Those who believe that men who are credibly accused of sexually assaulting or harassing women are perfectly appropriate candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court ... and the infuriated rest of us.
How else to explain reaction to a newly surfaced allegation of sexual misconduct against beer-loving Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh?
President Trump urged Kavanaugh to sue for libel and has urged the Justice Department to "rescue" Kavanaugh -- how exactly that rescue would occur is not clear.

Top-tier Democratic presidential candidates are calling for Kavanaugh's impeachment. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a front-runner, is advocating that both Trump and Kavanaugh be impeached, though that is unlikely.
Even if House Democrats were to bring articles of impeachment against Trump and/or Kavanaugh, the Republican-controlled Senate would certainly never vote to remove either from office. However, in the event that the House retains a Democratic majority and the Senate goes Democratic after the 2020 elections ... well, a girl can dream, can't she?
Kavanaugh cemented the court's conservative majority when he replaced former Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a centrist who was often described as the quintessential swing vote.
Kavanaugh, confirmed by the narrowest margin in modern history, should never have been seated.
During his confirmation hearing, he shredded any pretense of judicial impartiality when he accused those who opposed his nomination of seeking "revenge on behalf of the Clintons" and "left-wing opposition groups."
His main accuser, research psychologist Christine Blasey Ford, testified that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a private home at a high school party in the presence of his friend Mark Judge. "Indelible in the hippocampus," she said, "is the laughter." The hippocampus is the part of the brain where trauma is encoded as memory.
To borrow that phrase from Ford, indelible in my hippocampus is a man whose nastiness to Democratic senators, red-faced sputtering and self-pity showed him to be utterly unsuited for the job of Supreme Court justice.
Those calling for his impeachment believe that he lied repeatedly during those hearings -- about his drinking, about the meaning of words in his high school yearbook ("boof" and "devil's triangle") and about the alleged college assaults, among other things.
Given what we know about Kavanaugh, his sense of entitlement and his affection for beer, the new story about his drunken college misbehavior, contained in a just-released book by New York Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly, is not even especially shocking.
In "The Education of Brett Kavanaugh," they write that in addition to a previously known claim that a drunken Kavanaugh exposed himself to a Yale University classmate named Deborah Ramirez, he is also alleged to have pushed his penis into the hand of a second female classmate during a drunken dorm party.
The classmate in the second case does not remember the incident, according to her friends, and declined to be interviewed by the reporters.
But a male classmate, Washington attorney Max Stier, who said he witnessed the event, contacted Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who contacted FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, asking him to get in touch with Stier.
The FBI never contacted Stier, and who knows how many other potential witnesses are out there?
Why didn't the FBI properly investigate?
Because, as you probably recall, Trump and Senate Republicans restricted the time frame and limited the scope of the inquiry.
The resulting "investigation" was a sham.
If you think this was a singular event, don't be too sure. If given the chance, Republicans would surely rush through another Supreme Court confirmation, facts and investigations be damned.
Keep praying for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
On the day that Kavanaugh was confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, "One of the reasons I chose him is because there is nobody with a squeaky-clean past like Brett Kavanaugh."
The president said this with a straight face (I presume) even after the country had been riveted a week or so earlier by Ford's testimony that when he was 17 and she was 15, Kavanaugh drunkenly pinned her to a bed, tried to undress her and ground his body against hers.
When she tried to scream, she claimed, he put his hand over her mouth.
"I thought he might inadvertently kill me," Ford said. "He was trying to attack me and remove my clothing." She said she was saved only because one of Kavanaugh's friends, Mark Judge, jumped on both of them and they all tumbled to the ground, whereupon she escaped.
Kavanaugh "categorically and unequivocally" denied the allegation. "I did not do this back in high school or at any time." Judge said he had no memory of the event and had never witnessed such behavior from his friend; he also authored a memoir that detailed his blackout drinking as a high school student.
As I noted during Kavanaugh's confirmation, Ford was far more credible than Kavanaugh. She was a traumatized teenager at the time of the alleged attack; he was a beer-swilling jock who made jokes in his yearbook about anal sex ("boofing") and threesomes ("devil's triangle"), then lied to the Senate about what those terms meant.
I would never suggest that he be charged with a crime for his alleged high school and college misbehavior. That would be pointless all these years later.
The issue was and is whether a man with such an explosive and accusatory temperament, who has been credibly accused of sexually assaulting women -- even if the bad behavior occurred decades ago -- should have been rewarded with a lifetime appointment on the highest court.
Surely our country deserves better.

Texto completo: Nadler says they'll press FBI on new claim but keep focus on Trump
House Democrats are downplaying the possibility of impeaching Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in the wake of a new allegation of sexual impropriety, keeping the investigative focus on President Trump even as 2020 Democratic hopefuls call for the justice's removal.
Members of the House Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), said Monday they will press the FBI about its review of allegations that emerged during Kavanaugh's bitter confirmation battle last fall and whether its inquiry was adequate - but they are deep into proceedings against Trump.
"Frankly, we are concentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president," Nadler told WNYC radio when asked about the possibility of ousting Kavanaugh. "Personally, I think the president ought to be impeached, but we have to concentrate on that for the next few months."
The Judiciary panel's caution stands in stark contrast to several of the presidential hopefuls, who called for Kavanaugh's impeachment after the New York Times reported over the weekend a new claim against the justice while he was a student at Yale University.
Clamoring for impeachment were Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke and former housing and urban development secretary Julián Castro.
Democrats expressed concerns not only with Kavanaugh's alleged conduct years ago but that he may have lied about his actions during his Senate confirmation hearing last year.
In response, Trump defended his nominee, taking to Twitter on Monday to claim that Kavanaugh was the one "being assaulted."
"The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News!" Trump wrote on Twitter. "This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems."
Congressional Democrats' reluctance to join the Kavanaugh impeachment calls highlights the party's realization about the political downside of the issue. In 2018, Republicans were able to rally their base around the Democrats' handling of the Kavanaugh nomination - portraying it as an effort to ruin an innocent man - to flip Senate seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday sought to use the latest attack on Kavanaugh as a political cudgel against the presidential candidates and the Democratic Party ahead of next year's elections.
"When you're this willing to launch unhinged personal attacks, you reveal a whole lot more about your own radicalism than about the men and women you target," McConnell said in a Senate floor speech.
According to the Times report, a college classmate, Max Stier, said he saw Kavanaugh with his pants down at a party where friends pushed Kavanaugh's penis into a young woman's hand. Stier notified senators and the FBI before Kavanaugh's confirmation last year, but the FBI did not investigate, the Times reported.
The Times report was based on interviews with "two officials who have communicated with Mr. Stier."
In an editor's note after initial publication, the Times said that the book on which the report was based noted that "the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident."
Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), who headed the Judiciary Committee last year, dismissed the latest revelation.
"In the end, there was no credible evidence to support any of the allegations," Grassley said, defending his job overseeing the confirmation battle. "Let me be clear: This is not an allegation. It's barely a third-hand rumor."
Even Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), the lone Democrat to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation, appeared to downplay the new report.
"I made my decision based on the facts," he said. "If you got other facts, bring them forward, but I made my decision on the facts."
Facing limited time, House Democrats privately worry that an effort to oust Kavanaugh would only undermine their investigation of Trump. Lawmakers also are reluctant to re-litigate the new episode because the student does not remember it.
Even some of the most liberal members of the Judiciary Committee said in interviews Monday that Trump was their top focus and any Kavanaugh impeachment demands were premature.
"We have an enormously packed agenda," said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.), a day ahead of the committee's hearing with Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager who will face questions about former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report and possible obstruction of justice.
"We need a lot more information in order to make a judgment about whether to impeach him as a sitting justice," said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.).
"Presidential criminality continues to be a clear and present threat to the republic, and so we have to remain focused on that," he added.
Nadler said that FBI Director Christopher A. Wray is already scheduled to testify before the judiciary panel next month and that lawmakers will question him about the FBI's review of the allegations.
The House Judiciary Committee has also requested records from the National Archives pertaining to Kavanaugh's career working in the White House before his appointment to the bench.
Panel spokesman Daniel Schwarz said the committee will closely inspect those documents, "given our suspicions that he lied to the Senate during the confirmation process."
Judiciary Democrats also say they could use the matter against the president in their impeachment investigation. They plan to press Wray on whether Trump or the administration in any way barred investigators from looking into the Stier allegation.
"If that is the case, such an obstruction would be an abuse of power by the president," Schwarz said.
Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court in October following testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, who said Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her while they were high school students in the 1980s.
Kavanaugh strenuously denied Ford's claim, calling it an "orchestrated political hit."
The new claim echoes an allegation made by a different Yale student, Deborah Ramirez, during Kavanaugh's confirmation process. Kavanaugh has denied that allegation.
The Washington Post reported Monday that Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) alerted the FBI of the allegation at issue but that it was not investigated.
Coons wrote to Wray on Oct. 2, requesting an "appropriate follow up" with one individual who had come to Coons with information about Kavanaugh. Although the person's name was redacted in the one-page letter, a spokesman for Coons confirmed Monday that the individual was Stier, a classmate of Kavanaugh at Yale who now leads a prominent nonpartisan group in Washington.
In the letter obtained by The Post, Coons said "several individuals" who wanted to share information with federal authorities had contacted his office, but they had "difficulty reaching anyone who will collect their information."
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the FBI was "straitjacketed" and there needs to be an investigation.
"The failure then is inevitably having repercussions now. It was a fatal flaw in the process, and there should be investigation now," he said.
Another committee member, Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), said she hoped Nadler would change his mind about Kavanaugh "because what's at stake here is whether or not a witness for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, no less, lied to Congress."

Texto completo: The stream burbled and sputtered, the cold of the glacial melt a refreshing bubble in the summer heat. Here, just steps from the afternoon tourist traffic on Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier National Park spoke to my soul. I was surrounded by a geologic miracle.
Across the stream, which pooled where that summer's woodfall had formed a small dam, the uplifted peaks stood as they have since around the time the dinosaurs arose. The mountains' strata - each layer the compressed sediment of an ancient seabed - shot upward, the dark boundaries of each sheet highlighted by the August sun. The whole mountain was canted like a huge table missing legs on one side. The moment lengthened. I tried to weigh a lifetime.
My wife, Beth, and I had come here to soak ourselves in a world wonder. We both have serious health problems, and study after study shows that spending time outdoors improves mental health and well-being. While such "forest bathing," as the Japanese call it, is not a cure for anything, we were hoping the mountain bathing we anticipated would at least give us a boost.
Minutes earlier, as we had backtracked across the park's famous road, we had stopped at an overlook we had missed that morning. The view spread across the valley, Heaven's Peak spiking in the distance. As cars pulled into the overlook, I spied a photographer working with two legs of his wooden tripod perched on the low stone retaining wall that was laid with the road in 1927. Dark-haired and hale, almost burly, he was peering at a large-format film camera. On the wall sat a worn black book of Ansel Adams photographs.
I asked his name. "Frank Ruggles," he said. He was working to re-create a series of photographs Adams had made in 1941. It was called the Mural Project. Adams had been hired to photograph the national parks of the West to majestically adorn the walls of the relatively new Interior Department building in Washington. World War II interceded, and Adams never finished.
But the legendary landscape photographer made many arresting images in the parks that year. Now Ruggles is reshooting them for an upcoming TV special and a coffee-table book.
"Those are crepuscular rays," Ruggles said as sun streaks broke through a puffy cloud, spotlighting a small glacier. "And they are as rare as hens' teeth." He pulled a modern camera with a long lens from his Jeep and began clicking.
As he did, Ruggles explained further: In 2020, it will have been 79 years since Adams made his images. The average American life span is now 79 years. So Ruggles is re-creating 150 of the 226 known mural photographs to showcase the changes in famous landscapes over an American lifetime. It's called the 79 Years Project.
Adams left a wealth of notes to follow: Dates of images, times, type of film shot and f-stop used. But Adams did not record where, precisely, he placed his cameras. So Ruggles, worn book of the mural photographs in hand, has to sleuth out each locale by sight.
Today, he had found where Adams shot Heaven's Peak. It was right here, where our paths intersected.
So Frank and I shared a moment, at about 4:45 p.m., Aug. 6, 2019. We chatted for a few more minutes, Ruggles telling me about hauling his even bigger large format camera - each negative spanning 8 inches by 10 - up from Logan Pass to Hidden Lake the day before. "That was special," he said of toting the 65-pound rig on a three-mile hike at high altitude.
I told him I used to work as a journalist, and we talked about a few people we both know. I marveled at the meeting, this commonality, right here, now, at this microscopic intersection in space and time, amid a landscape that the world began building so long ago that nothing had yet wriggled, swum or walked on this Earth. Platters of algae fossils were all these rocks had to say about life nearly 2 billion years ago.
Beth and I drove off, and next we stopped at the stream.
We had spent all day in the car, with breaks to gawk, but we are both too ill to venture on any of the Montana park's well-known hikes. The walk to the stream, however, was about as far as a squirrel can scurry in a minute, so we climbed down a few steps under the road's bridge, and just yards from the traffic we had what felt like a universe of peaks and valleys to ourselves.
I found a shelf of rock to sit on - hard against my bony bottom - and listened. My father will be 79 next year; he was born the same year as the Adams project. Earlier that day, I had heard that a former science editor at the New York Times, David Corcoran, had died of leukemia at age 72. I am a week away from 48.
That mountain peak was uplifted 200 million years ago. The flowers that speckled the pathway pushed up just weeks ago. A forest fire tore through this area four years prior. The two dozen glaciers remaining in the park will be gone in a decade because of climate change.
These numbers jumbled in my mind, but the number weighing on me most was unknowable: How many years did I have left to drink in the wonders of this Earth? That's a number nobody knows of themselves, of course, but my complex medical situation leaves me with a chronically uncomfortable feeling of racing toward an early end.
Last year, after years of disabling illness, I learned that I have a muscle disorder. But it's an incomplete diagnosis; the muscle tissue on the microscope slides looked terrible, a multiple-car wreck of necrotic tissue and atrophy, but not terrible in a specific enough way to finish the diagnosis.
"We're wondering about rare forms of ALS," a researcher at the National Institutes of Health told me. I had been wondering about that, too, for seven years, ever since 30 pounds of good weight - muscle - had melted off my body in a storm of twitches and fevers deep in the winter of 2012-2013. Later, the researcher decided to call my condition "atypical myositis," myositis being a family of inflammatory muscle disorders. But that term is more description than diagnosis. I don't know if 79 years are attainable; no doctor can tell me that.
Then again, no one younger than that knows whether he or she will hit that mark.
Beth embraced me and walked up the trail. I stayed and drank in the scene; a rain shadow veiled the top of a peak. As the first tears fell, so did a few fat drops of rain. My salt water mixed with the fresh from the sky, and both spattered the rock.
Soon the specks would wash into the stream, join the glacial melt and run to the ocean.

Texto completo: ALASKA
In 2016, the administrators of the Kenai Peninsula Borough, 75 miles south of Anchorage, did something radical: They decided that only people who belong to "official organizations" could give the invocation at the start of meetings, reports The New York Times. That meant atheists were not allowed to open meetings, nor was - inexplicably - a woman who was Jewish. After the ACLU challenged the discriminatory policy, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. This has made life quite unpleasant for administrators, who, unable to block the appearance of a "Satanic Temple" member, were horrified to hear her invocation begin with a hearty "Hail, Satan!" A dozen officials and attendees fled the meeting in response. Once outside, some joined protesters who carried signs saying "Reject Satan and his works" and "Know Jesus and his love."
UTAH
You'd never call Torrey House Press in Salt Lake City a big publishing firm, and one of the books it brought out this year was certainly small, at just 84 pages, but Ellen Meloy's Seasons: Desert Sketches is a gem. (See our review, "Last words from a desert scribe," HCN, 7/22/19.) The sketches were written in the 1990s as brief on-air essays for KUER, and they sat on a shelf until this collection brought them back to life. Meloy, who died suddenly in 2004, can make you laugh out loud as she mocks a person who opposes wolf reintro-duction because wolves jump on some deer and eat that animal alive." "He's right," Meloy says, "nature is rude and wolves should change their ways." Meloy then slyly suggests that wolves dump their "disgusting pack technique" and switch to takeout. We're so distant from the wild, she says, that we forget that we are mammals who stalk our own prey at Safeway. "The wolf on your nature poster is a killer, a predator of supreme skill and endurance," Meloy says. "The human in your mirror is an animal. Both revelations should humble and ennoble us."
THE WEST
When Kenneth Nesslage's 95-year-old mother died recently in Utah, the mortuary there neglected to inform the Social Security Administration. That meant Nesslage, who lives in western Colorado, had to notify the federal agency. But when officials asked him for his own Social Security number, Nesslage inadvertently "sent himself into the digital jaws of death," reports the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel. According to agency computer records, Nesslage himself was dead, and worse, after a few days he realized "it was much easier to die than to come back to life." His credit card was declined at a restaurant, a machine he leased to aid his breathing was recalled by the company, and the bank holding his mortgage sent condolences but then got down to nitty-gritty financial questions. His bank also insisted that he "physically walk into the nearest branch" to prove that he existed. Altogether, he says, it made him feel like a "dead man walking." Though it took him four trips to his Social Security office to get formally resurrected, Nesslage says he's now able to laugh about it all. The experience has also helped him decide what he wants on his headstone: "Here lies Ken Nesslage. The second time he died, it worked."
UTAH
It probably helped that Andrew Gillreath-Brown, an archaeology doctoral candidate at Washington State University, was a tattoo enthusiast. He was doing a routine inventory check of a museum box at the university when he noticed a needle fashioned from skunk-bush wood attached to two cactus spines. Then he picked it up and "saw the black staining on the tips" of the spines, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. Voila! He'd discovered a tattoo-delivery instrument bound together with yucca. Other artifacts found in the same place in the Grand Gulch area of Bears Ears in southeastern Utah date back almost 2,000 years, which makes the tattoo needle the oldest ever found in Western North America. Gillreath-Brown says the tattoo needles were created by the Ancestral Pueblo civilization, which flourished in what is now southeastern Utah between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D., long before the arrival of white settlers. Gillreath-Brown, who did some experimental tattooing with the device on pigskin, called the prickly pear spines "very efficient," although, as he told Newsweek, "I think it would have hurt some."
OREGON
Three years ago, Lainey Morse started Original Goat Yoga. It's not quite what we first pictured - goats in yoga pants cavorting around on people's lower backs - but it sounds fun: "The animals nuzzle participants and occasionally cuddle with them as they stretch." The business took off like a rocket, expanding to 12 locations across the country. But now there's a problem: Oregon zoning laws prevent Morse from running the business in her home state. According to writers from the High School Journalism Institute, state law says goats are farm animals. "The irony is, if we slaughtered our goats, we could do goat yoga," says Sean Scorvo, Morse's business partner. Scorvo and Morse want lawmakers to pass an exception to state law so the goats on their farm can just be goats while hanging out with people on yoga mats. Meanwhile, goat yoga classes and events are taking place in California, Colorado and seven other states.

Brett Kavanaugh is getting the Title IX treatment

Texto completo: What has happened to Justice Brett Kavanaugh sounds crazy, at least at first glance.
His confirmation to the Supreme Court was almost derailed by last-minute sexual assault allegations that emerged after his confirmation hearing was already complete. Professor Christine Blasey Ford came forward to accuse Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Even though she could provide no meaningful corroborating evidence or witnesses, almost all elected Democrats branded Kavanaugh a rapist on the basis of the accusation alone, nearly derailing his nomination and destroying his reputation.
Months later, we find out that Blasey Ford was motivated in part by protecting Roe v. Wade and other political concerns all along. Now, the New York Times just released a “bombshell” supposedly detailing more sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh. They were forced to correct the story and admit that they originally omitted a few important details: Like the fact that the woman in question does not remember the incident.
Nonetheless, top Democrats such as Kamala Harris (a Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat who must have known every detail in this new report already) and Elizabeth Warren have called for Kavanaugh’s impeachment. (That's what you do when you're running for president, I guess.)TweetAll this in mind, the continued debacle seems like a nightmare; an orchestrated effort to ruin a man’s life and toss aside due process. Yet what has happened with Kavanaugh is actually shockingly ordinary, even if it normally doesn’t receive this level of attention. On college campuses across the country, young men are regularly and routinely railroaded in similar ways under hostile Title IX sexual assault disciplinary proceedings.
In 2011, then clarified in 2014, the Obama administration issued a “Dear Colleague” letter instructing colleges and universities to follow clearly inadequate procedures when investigating sexual assault claims. Under Obama-era rules, schools were instructed to use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard, meaning that they need only be 51% certain of guilt in order to rule against an accused student and brand them a rapist for life. Although that is the standard used in most civil trials, those trials involve a number of due process rights for defendants that the Obama administration's campus star chambers lacked by design. The Obama-era standard discouraged the cross-examination of accusers and encouraged “double jeopardy,” in that accusers were permitted to appeal “not guilty” verdicts.
Although Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos withdrew the Obama-era “Dear Colleague” letter in 2017, schools around the country still choose to follow these wholly inadequate rules. This means that young men at campuses across the country — some but not all of whom are surely guilty — are still being subjected to unfair processes and procedures that look just like Kavanaugh’s nightmare.
The only difference is that Kavanaugh, as unfortunate as his situation might be, has the entire force of the presidency, the Republican establishment, and conservative media behind him. This is why he was confirmed despite the debacle, the Democrats’ miscarriage of justice stopped in its tracks. And it’s why, no matter how loud 2020 Democrats scream, Kavanaugh will not be impeached from the Supreme Court based on current dubious and uncorroborated allegations.
University of Massachusetts engineering student Kwadwo Bonsu wasn’t so lucky. The student at my alma mater had a sexual encounter with a young woman, which she initiated, and she even gave him her phone number after. Then she changed her mind and accused him of assault. When the police investigated, no charges were filed, and the case was dropped. But UMass suspended him anyway. As I wrote previously, “Eventually, he was barred from the campus in its entirety and suspended from the university. He ended up dropping out and was rejected from several other universities he applied to. His life was turned upside down, over a patently false claim and a bureaucracy set up to disregard the rights of the accused.”
There was no 24-hour Fox News clamoring in Bonsu’s defense. There was no impassioned speech by Lindsey Graham to defend his good name. Conservative journalists like Mollie Hemingway weren't able to write books about his experience.
God willing, Brett Kavanaugh will emerge from this smear campaign with his career bruised but intact. For the countless young men railroaded under Title IX, however, the future is not nearly so bright.

Wonder who's undermining the news media? Just look at Sunday's New York Times

Texto completo: The press in the United States suffers from a crisis of credibility.
It is almost entirely self-inflicted.
The New York Times this weekend published a supposed “bombshell” article alleging Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh twice exposed himself to female classmates when he was a student at Yale. The Times article, drawn from an excerpt of a book authored by two Times reporters, is supremely misleading. It not only downplays serious holes in the allegations against Kavanaugh — relying heavily on vague language to suggest the judge is indeed guilty of sexual misconduct — but the article, as it appeared originally in print and online, also omitted exculpatory details found only in the forthcoming reporters’ book on last year's Supreme Court confirmation hearings.
It is just an oversight, I am sure, that the first version of the article forgot to mention that one of the alleged victims of Kavanaugh’s alleged depredations told her friends she has no memory of what is even being alleged, according to the Times’ own reporting.
The op-ed's first accusation comes from former Kavanaugh classmate Deborah Ramirez, whose story is still as flimsy and unbelievable as when it was first told by the New Yorker. The Times article claims, “At least seven people, including Ms. Ramirez’s mother, heard about the Yale incident long before Mr. Kavanaugh was a federal judge.” However, the book from which the article is drawn reports that Ramirez’s mother remembers only that her daughter said: “something happened at Yale." That’s it.
There is more.
The excerpt states also that, “Two F.B.I. agents interviewed Ms. Ramirez, telling her that they found her ‘credible.’” The wording here is intentionally ambiguous. Did the agents use the word “credible” in a conversation with the Times reporters? Or are the reporters merely relaying what Ramirez claims she was told by FBI agents? It is obvious the reader is meant to assume the former. Otherwise, what is the point of including this detail?
The second allegation against Kavanaugh is even more absurd. For starters, the Times was not told about the additional incident by the alleged victim herself. Rather, the story comes from Democratic consultant Max Stier, who claims to have witnessed Kavanaugh exposing himself to a second female colleague. Stier, who the Times bills simply as the head of a nonprofit organization in Washington, D.C., and a “respected thought leader,” declined to “discuss the episode publicly,” the op-ed notes.
Just so we are all on the same page: The first allegation comes from a woman who said previously she was not "confident" it was Kavanaugh who exposed himself until after she “assessed” her memories 30-plus years later and talked it over with her attorney. This same woman, by the way, contacted former Yale classmates about the incident prior to going public, the Times itself reported last year. The second allegation comes from a Democratic consultant who claims he once saw something but won’t go public with his story.
Amazingly enough, it goes from bad to worse for the Times. Late Sunday evening, the paper added an editor’s note to the book excerpt it published earlier. It reads [emphasis added]:
An earlier version of this article, which was adapted from a forthcoming book, did not include one element of the book’s account regarding an assertion by a Yale classmate that friends of Brett Kavanaugh pushed his penis into the hands of a female student at a drunken dorm party. The book reports that the female student declined to be interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident. That information has been added to the article.
The supposed victim from Stier’s story does not even recall the alleged incident, according to the Times' reporting, and it did not occur to the paper's editors to include that detail in the original version of the article? That is inexcusable.
If you suspect that this was merely a regrettable oversight, I am here to disabuse you of that notion. The Times excluded this exact same information from its additional reporting on the matter. In a follow-up report, titled “Calls for Kavanaugh’s Impeachment Come Amid New Misconduct Allegations,” that appeared Sunday evening on the paper’s website, the Times again omitted the same exculpatory details. The online report has since been amended to note Stier’s alleged victim reportedly has no memory of the supposed incident. There is no editor’s note drawing attention to the report's updated language. Also, the print edition of the story was not amended prior to Monday delivery. The Sept. 16 print edition makes no mention whatsoever of the alleged victim’s reported failure to recall Stier’s version of events.
A New York Times spokesperson did not respond the Washington Examiner's request for comment.
There is no charitable interpretation for what happened this weekend. These reports represent a conscious attempt to deceive the public. Even if the omissions were the product of an honest editorial mistake, the authors of the articles would have caught them. These articles were deceptive because they were designed to be deceptive.
Newsrooms talk a big game these days about the pressure they are under operating in a world where the president of the United States is openly hostile to the press. Journalists and commentators complain a lot about how difficult it is to reach audiences when their credibility is challenged daily by the White House. But I assure you, nothing this president does or says comes close to matching the wounds the press inflicts on itself with its slipshod, ham-fisted brand of politically-skewed reporting.
No one forced the Times to misreport the allegations against Kavanaugh. No once forced the Times to omit crucial context. The paper did that all on its own.
In February 2017, shortly after the inauguration of President Trump, the Times unveiled an ad campaign that declared, “The truth is more important now than ever.”
If only the New York Times believed that.

Texto completo: It's hard to hear the truth, especially when it flies in the face of stories you have been told since you were born. The truth can shock a person, usually leaving them with one of two choices - either defend the status quo or be open to additional facts.
The New York Times' 1619 Project is taking America on a truth-seeking mission. Marking the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship docking on Virginia's shores, the collection of essays reveals that the story we learned in school, in public life, and even in mainstream media omits many important facts.
As readers turn the pages, they are confronted with a raw, unfiltered and honest discussion about the true origins of the United States of America, not the romanticized version of American history we grew up with. This story, one of brutality, injustice and resiliency, is far more difficult to embrace.
Over the last three years, we have watched in horror as racist extremists engaged in increasingly violent and brazen acts of domestic terrorism in the name of white supremacy. Each time, we turned away in disgust, swearing "this is not us - this is not America." But this is us.
Our country is now, finally, beginning to engage in a debate - a debate about what America truly is, who it belongs to, and what it ought to be. By providing a full, unvarnished record of our collective history - including details that are often left from the history books - Nikole Hannah Jones and the authors of the 1619 Project push this debate forward. For example, how many Americans know that in 1831 the United States produced nearly half of the world's cotton - all picked by slaves? How many know that the bodies of these men, women and children were used as collateral for mortgages and other loans? Those bodies literally built wealth for white families and American industries, wealth that was passed down through generations.
This information is critical when trying to better understand the stark racial wealth gap that exists in America today, a direct result of 400 years of systematic inequality compounded to build white wealth while blocking most African Americans from gaining a financial foothold.
How many public school children are taught about the 1921 massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma? Tulsa was home to "Black Wall Street," the wealthiest black community in the country. But after a black man was accused of assaulting a white woman, a riot erupted that left at least 300 black people murdered, 10,000 more homeless and 35 square blocks destroyed.
How could this happen? How could it be forgotten? Was there any justice?
There was and continues to be a presumption of danger and criminality for black people, one that is largely rooted in slavery. This presumption is reflected in our criminal justice system but also in everyday interactions with our fellow Americans.
Here's the truth: We have a lot of work to do in order to better understand our collective history. It's not going to be easy, because our past is not pristine. It's full of unimaginable violence and harm, but it's ours, and despite its ugliness our nation has undoubtedly made progress.
We've progressed in large part because of the contributions and sacrifices made by African Americans. We can no longer deny this fact, nor can we continue to deny African Americans' humanity and their unmeasurable contributions to this country. African Americans are just as American as white Americans and their experiences must be taught, learned and entrenched in American hearts and minds.
Holding these truths as self-evident, as part of our collective past, is the only way to move toward that more perfect union. The truth will set us free, but only if we listen to it.
Danyelle Solomon is vice president of race and ethnicity policy at the Center for American Progress.

REVIEW OF U.S. JUSTICE LIMITED BY FBI; More than a dozen potential witnesses in Brett M. Kavanaugh's sex misconduct case were not interviewed.

Texto completo: As Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh prepares for his second year on the Supreme Court, new reporting has detailed how the limits ordered by the White House and Senate Republicans last year constrained the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct when he was a college freshman.
The FBI was informed of allegations that Kavanaugh, while drunk during his freshman year at Yale, exposed himself to two heavily intoxicated female classmates on separate occasions. The bureau did not interview more than a dozen people who said they could provide information about the incidents.
One of the accounts, reported by Deborah Ramirez, was made public at the time of Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings.

The other, not publicly known until this weekend, was reported by a male classmate who said he witnessed the incident. He unsuccessfully sought to get the FBI to investigate with help from a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who asked FBI Director Christopher A. Wray to look into the allegation.
The new details are based on interviews conducted by this reporter and two reporters for the New York Times for books about the confirmation. The New York Times reported some details late Saturday from its reporters' new book.
Wray has declined requests by this reporter to be interviewed about the bureau's performance. Kavanaugh also declined to be interviewed.
The best-known allegation against Kavanaugh was the accusation by Christine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor from California, that he assaulted her when they were high school students. Kavanaugh heatedly denied her allegation when he and Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee in a televised hearing.
The committee's Republican majority declined to give a public hearing to Ramirez, and it is unclear how many senators knew of the allegation of a second, similar incident at Yale. The committee's chairman, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and its senior Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, were both informed of the existence of the allegation.
Ramirez alleged that Kavanaugh exposed his penis and caused her to touch it while they were inebriated during a drinking game in a dormitory suite in late 1983 or early 1984. Kavanaugh denied her allegation.
The other allegation, previously unreported, came from Washington lawyer Max Stier, who told Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) that he witnessed Kavanaugh exposing himself to a different female classmate during their freshman year.
Both Kavanaugh and the woman were heavily intoxicated at the time, according to Stier's account, as described by people familiar with the contacts between him and Coons and others who have spoken with Stier since Kavanaugh's confirmation.
The woman in that case, a friend of Ramirez, has denied that she was assaulted, telling friends she has no memory of such an incident. According to Stier's account, the woman was so inebriated at the time that she could easily have no memory of it.
Coons sent Wray a letter on Oct. 2 -- four days before the Senate voted on Kavanaugh -- specifically naming Stier as someone he wanted the FBI director to follow up with.
The FBI never contacted Stier. The bureau also did not interview other classmates who said they had heard at the time of either the incident Stier reported or the one involving Ramirez.
Stier has declined to comment publicly on the allegation. He wanted his account to remain confidential, both for the sake of the woman, a widow with three children, and for his own professional considerations.
Stier founded a nonpartisan, nonprofit group to promote public service roughly two decades ago. Before that, he was a lawyer at Washington's Williams & Connolly firm, where he worked with the team that defended then-President Clinton. Several Republican commentators on Sunday zeroed in on that part of his resume to discredit his account as partisan.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh stated under oath that he was never so drunk that he would pass out or forget what he'd done while intoxicated.
A number of former classmates who knew him said they were sufficiently upset by that statement, which they considered untruthful, that they contacted the FBI. None received responses from the bureau.
On Sunday, President Trump defended Kavanaugh.
Trump called on the Justice Department to "come to [Kavanaugh's] rescue," suggesting on Twitter that the administration's opponents were trying to deter the justice from rulings favorable to the administration.
"They are trying to influence his opinions. Can't let that happen!" he wrote.
"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY," Trump wrote in one tweet. In another, he urged that the justice sue for "liable," later correcting the spelling to "libel."
The new reports reopened some of the bitter, partisan divisions that accompanied Kavanaugh's confirmation. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls called for Kavanaugh's impeachment, including Sen. Kamala Harris, a Judiciary committee member, who wrote on Twitter that "Brett Kavanaugh lied to the U.S. Senate and most importantly to the American people."
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke made similar calls.
Warren tweeted that the new allegations were "disturbing," adding, "Like the man who appointed him, Kavanaugh should be impeached."
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said he supported using "any appropriate constitutional mechanism" against Kavanaugh.
At the time that Coons reported Stier's allegation to the FBI director, the White House and Senate Republican leaders had directed the bureau to reopen Kavanaugh's background check. They acted under pressure from three undecided Republican senators who wanted an investigation of the allegations made by Ford and Ramirez.
The Judiciary Committee's Republican majority gave the FBI a week and said agents could interview four people. The list was later expanded to 10 people at the insistence of the swing-vote senators.
Lawyers for Ford and Ramirez, however, sent letters to Wray that, together, named more than 50 individuals that the bureau's agents should interview. Only nine were ever contacted -- all of them from the list that the Republicans had submitted.
One of the letters named the woman in the incident Stier said he witnessed.
"We have been advised that while at Yale, Mr. Kavanaugh exposed himself" to the woman "and forced her to touch his penis. Witnesses were present and we have been advised that they will be contacting the FBI with their first-hand accounts," the letter said.
Stier knew both Kavanaugh and the young woman and has told people that he is certain of their identities. According to his account, two drunken male students dragged the woman toward Kavanaugh, who was also intoxicated and standing with his penis exposed, amid much laughter from the men.
The FBI's reopened background check, which began late on Friday, Sept. 28, lasted less than a week.
The following Saturday, Oct. 6, the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh by a largely party-line vote of 50 to 48, the narrowest margin of support for a new justice since 1881.

Texto completo: La vida como agente de la Patrulla Fronteriza (CBP) es insoportable desde que Donald Trump es presidente de Estados Unidos.
Un reporte del New York Times, recoge testimonios sobre lo poco llevadero que ha sido el trabajo de cientos de agentes desde que las políticas antiinmigrantes de Trump se aplican.
Varios reconocieron que están cansados de ser llamados “asesinos de niños” o “vendidos” por los ciudadanos. Algunos solamente comen su almuerzo en restaurantes “amigables con la Patrulla Fronteriza “.
El reportaje, el principal de la edición dominical del diario neoyorquino, también revela que la agencia tiene que lidiar con decenas de renuncias.
“Enjaular personas por actividades que no eran violentas me comía vivo”, dijo un hombre de Arizona que renunció hace un año.
El exagente Chris Harris, que estuvo 21 años en la CBP dijo que lo más difícil para ellos ha sido pasar de ser un grupo al que nadie le daba importancia a uno odiado por la población.
“La moral era pobre en el pasado, pero ahora está en un abismo. Conozco a muchos que quieren irse “, dijo Harris al Times.
La naturaleza del trabajo ha pasado de vigilar la frontera en puntos específicos a atender emergencias médicas y proveer alimentos a bebés, entre otros ejemplos.
La CBP además sufre con problemas de reclutamiento. El artículo dice que tiene 1,800 agentes menos de lo esperado. Agentes se quejan de la falta de infraestructura o dinero para operar lo que ellos asocian como una crisis humanitaria en la frontera.
Un gran número de agentes lamenta la separación de menores o la detención en jaulas de personas enfermas.

Twisty bromance takes center stage in noirish ‘Strangers on a Train’

Texto completo: No, but you’ve seen the movie? If it’s “Strangers on a Train” we’re talking about, your mind’s eye will be dancing with visions of a cigarette lighter agleam in the twin lenses of a woman’s glasses, of spectators in the bleachers (all but one!) following a tennis ball back and forth and back and forth across the net, of an out-of-control carousel spinning off its axle, all in Alfred Hitchcock’s midcentury black and white.
Turn to Patricia Highsmith’s acid-etched novel of the same name, published just the year before the movie, and what do you find? Not one of those defining cinematic moments. But the key conceit is there: You kill the monkey on my back, and I’ll kill the monkey on your back. Crisscross. Two perfect murders. Who will ever connect the dots? We never met.
From this weekend through Sept. 29, the ProArts Playhouse at the Azeka Shopping Center rolls into the new season with a third iteration of “Strangers on a Train.” As adapted for the London stage by the playwright and screenwriter Craig Warner six years ago, Hitchcock’s queasy, one-sided bromance reverts to Highsmith’s more ambivalent geometry, possibly multitriangular, with twisted Oedipal inflections.
Geronimo Son appears as the charismatic ne’er-do-well Charles Bruno, stalking Jefferson Davis as the architect Guy Haines, an Arrow-collar type in thrall to the rules. But Bruno (who pleads with Guy to call him “Charley,” as his mother does) instantly senses something unexpressed.
“I can spot a spark a mile off,” he says seconds after the two strike up their first conversation. Later Bruno daydreams out loud of their going away together, apparently forever, “to some other planet even.” Guy never says yes when it counts, but he never says no.
At ProArts the train-riding strangers’ engineer is Tina Kailiponi, a drama teacher with extensive production credits in island community theater, at the controls as director in her own right of her first show for grown-ups.
As a frequent assistant to David Johnston, creator perhaps most notably of the Maui Academy of Performing Arts’ landmark “Les Miz” of 2013, Kailiponi acknowledges her debt to his uncluttered, cinematic approach. She has composed her stage pictures for “Strangers” in grayscale, spiking each scene with one splash of red.
Local audiences with an eye for stagecraft will recognize Kailiponi’s sliding panels, minimal furnishings and ever-present double-width train seats on casters as bedrock School of Johnston.
“The basis,” say Kailiponi, “is to start with something simple, keep it functional, then work your way up.” Forget the helicopters and falling chandeliers, in other words, but dive deep into the characters.
“In rehearsal we realized that for everything you see, there’s something you don’t see. So, we ran with that. Every character has secrets that are never shared, least of all with other members of the company.”
Even so, at a run-through last weekend, without light or sound cues to turn up the heat, some players may have tipped their cards a little. As Elsie, Bruno’s smitten, age-defying mother, Anne Marie Wilder hinted at self- knowledge within an iron butterfly’s self-delusions. Guy’s endlessly reassuring second wife, Anne Faulkner, on the other hand, remained the total enigma. In the absence of Megan Caccamo, her lines were distributed between the stage manager, Kiegan Otterson, who acted some of her scenes on stage, and a female assistant who read them from offstage.
When it was over, the two leads came out front to size up their own parts and each other’s.
“Bruno’s got a zest for life,” says Son of the man he plays. “He’s willing to explore, to go places. I like that. I dislike that’s he’s a drunk, burning himself away, throwing away his potential. Like Bruno, Guy’s a dreamer, but he’s practical, too. He wants to build things. What I dislike about Guy is that he’s a coward. He needs to be who he is.”
Walking in the other man’s shoes, Davis likes Guy’s private struggle. “Guy has a gun, remember, which he bought before the story begins,” Davis says. “And he’s never shot it. I like his pride that he’s been able to suppress half of his duality. I don’t like the way he allows Bruno to pull his strings.
“What do I like about Bruno, apart from his jawline? His confidence. What I don’t like is that he’s had everything handed to him. He’s a spoiled brat. He doesn’t take things seriously.
“There’s so much subtext in this play,” Davis continues, “more than in any other I’ve done. At one point, as an exercise, Tina asked us not to speak our lines, but to pull up subtext. I thought it would be really hard. Once we started, I felt we could go on forever.”

New season with first executive director
With “Strangers on a Train,” the ProArts Playhouse launches not just a new season, but a new era under the leadership of Lin McEwan, 39, the company’s first executive director.
Over recent seasons, Maui audiences have cheered her in the Audrey Hepburn role in the thriller “Wait Until Dark,” in the Liza Minnelli role in “Cabaret” and as women’s rights advocate Mary Wollstonecraft in “Vindication,” a new play from McEwan’s own pen.
ProArts was founded on a professional footing in 2006 by Jonathan Lehman. The company first appeared at the Maui Beach Hotel. As of 2010, ProArts has occupied its permanent 104-seat home at the Azeka Shopping Center. After Lehman’s death in 2016, Richard Vetterli ran the theater pro bono for nearly a year. McEw-an’s immediate predecessor was Kristi Scott, who announced the 2019-20 season’s lineup in April at a matinee of “Avenue Q.”
Officially, McEwan is just a week into her new job. But she’s been transitioning for several months now, and her stamp will be immediately apparent in a new chamber music series, art installations, a writing workshop and other initiatives.
Her quote for the day: “I’m having the time of my life.”

Texto completo: FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - In one week, Antonio Brown has asked for and received his release from the Oakland Raiders, signed a deal with the Patriots, received an invitation to room at the Brady-Bundchen residence, been accused in a lawsuit of sexual assault and rape by a former trainer, denied the allegations through a lawyer and through his agent in an appearance on "SportsCenter," begun practicing with the Patriots, changed his jersey number, gone on Instagram Live with Alex Guerrero from the TB12 Center, noted gleefully that 17,000 people were watching that broadcast, been dropped by the helmet manufacturer Xenith (which had been sponsoring him since solving his helmet issues in Oakland this summer) and apparently has gotten the green light to play against the Dolphins on Sunday.
The Patriots have discussed none of it.
"No," said Phillip Dorsett. "It's the Dolphins."
So with each new story rising long before the sun each morning, spawning headlines, drawing to Foxborough reporters who might otherwise be covering government or world affairs and furthering the uncertain circumstances around one of the best receivers in football, that was it. Inside Gillette Stadium, there was no big team meeting called, no edict given from Bill Belichick, according to multiple players. It did not come up in an official capacity.
It had taken a while for Belichick and the coaching staff to even acknowledge the signing of Brown. When they finally did Tuesday, their comments were comically understated.
"Well, we think he'll help our team, but until we start working with him ...," Belichick said.
"Just an overall solid player that has done a lot of good things in our league," added offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels.
Among the good: 11,207 receiving yards in nine seasons, four All-Pro selections and a league-leading 15 touchdowns just last season.
But then the bad came.
A little after 8 p.m. on Tuesday, the New York Times broke the news that a woman named Britney Taylor, who met Brown in college and trained him in 2017 and 2018, had alleged in a civil suit that Brown sexually assaulted her on three occasions, one of which was described as forcible rape. Included in the lawsuit are messages apparently from Brown to Taylor that describe one of the alleged assaults and contain disturbing, misogynistic language.
Wednesday morning, Belichick walked out of his scheduled news conference after 3 minutes and 50 seconds of back-and-forth. He spoke 151 words total. On Friday, he spoke 231 in one answer about offensive line depth.
He said Brown would be at practice but would not say if he knew Brown was about to be called a sexual abuser when he decided to make him a part of the team. The news conference ended after an exchange in which Belichick was asked what conversations he's had with Brown.
"Yeah, I mean I'm done with that, OK?" Belichick said. "Anything else on Miami? Any other questions?"
Meanwhile, it was still Wednesday, a big day in Foxborough. The middle of the week is when the padded practices happen. Players are in full install mode getting ready for Sunday.
It went unspoken, but the message had come down from coaches to players that football was their only business. A few veterans had the OK to say the allegations were serious but people shouldn't rush to judgment.
"I don't want to minimize the serious nature of [the allegations], but I don't feel I'm qualified to really speak to it because I don't know anything about it," Matthew Slater said.

Texto completo: James Poniewozik started prepping for his future career as the New York Times chief television critic early. "I grew up watching more TV than is probably strictly advisable," says the University of Michigan alum, who was born and raised in Monroe.
As the youngest sibling in his family by nine years, Poniewozik also was exposed to shows that were, as he puts it, age-inappropriate. He watched the 1970s late-night soap satire "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" with his older sister, and — here's the pre-VCR age part — had to listen to before-its-time talk show parody "Fernwood Tonight" on audiotape recorded by his sister because it was on too late.
Such dedication helped Poniewozik hone his skills for observing how TV changed American culture and vice-versa, a critical tool for his new book "Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television, and the Fracturing of America," which came out Tuesday. It's a smart, engaging analysis of how the evolution of TV and Donald Trump's rise to the presidency are inexorably tied together in what's become a "Bachelor"-type love affair where publicity and ratings, and the love of his 30 to 40 percent base, conquers all.
Publishers Weekly calls "Audience of One" a "caustic, scintillating cultural history." It's that, and more, as Poniewozik deconstructs the ways Trump had wormed his way into our collective consciousness long before he rode the down elevator in Trump Tower to kick off his White House campaign. He makes a convincing case that the splintering of the three-network system, the rise of reality TV and the 24-7 news cycle was the Petri dish that fed the cellular structure of a presidential victory that politicians and pundits didn't see coming. (He also uses "Caddyshack" to deconstruct at least one portion of Trump's campaign strategy.)
Poniewozik will be talking about his book in October at the Ann Arbor District Library downtown branch and the Metro Detroit Book and Author Society's fall luncheon. He spoke to the Free Press recently about Trump's ability to reflect a changing TV landscape and his stylistic evolution through the decades. Here are six things about the book that help illuminate the 24-7 reality saga that America has been living in since the November 2016 election.
1. Donald Trump, the TV character Poniewozik traces the birth of Donald Trump, the TV character, to a 1980 interview with then-"Today" host Tom Brokaw that presented Trump as a crown prince of Manhattan real estate. Was the author surprised by Trump's comparatively restrained tone back then, which he notes matched the mainstream manners of the pre-cable landscape? "I'm surprised by, when you watch those early clips, how soft-spoken he is. There are still elements of the Trump who is president now ... the kind of swagger even in those early appearances. It's not just that he speaks in much more diagrammable sentences. ... (He's) this kind of charming, preppy rascal rather than the belligerent, constant fighter, 'you're fired' guy. It was the tone that was very different, and that sort of led me to the angle of how the tone of television has changed over the years, and he's had a chameleon-like ability to evolve with it."
2. 'Look like the thing' In the 1990s, Trump appeared as himself in sitcom cameos and TV commercials, cementing his status as an icon of wealth. "Symbolism is very important to TV. It's very important to entertainment. He always understood that it is more effective to look like the thing than to be the thing," says Poniewozik. Even when Trump was co-starring in pop-culture flotsam like a McDonald's ad with the fast-food chain's purple mascot Grimace, it didn't devalue him "because the premise of it is Donald Trump is this fabulous, braggadocio rich guy and he holds that little chunk of your brain. ... A Christmas tree means Christmas, the Statue of Liberty means freedom, and Donald Trump means rich guy."
3. A boost from 'The Apprentice' Poniewozik illuminates Trump's reign in the 2000s on "The Apprentice" by noting that reality TV fans are aware that the genre is manipulative and staged, but they still enjoy it. That fact may have helped Trump's 2016 presidential campaign on several fronts. "He was putting on the (campaign's) show, and the show appealed in one way to people who were his dedicated partisan fans through Fox News, and it appealed in a different way to people who were maybe just kind of fed up with things and wanted to quote-unquote shake things up. And the show even played to people who didn't like him politically, but had a good time dunking on him and (saying), 'Isn't it crazy, Donald Trump, this character from TV, is running for president!' That turned out to be a huge not-so-secret weapon for him."
4. Blaming cable news The fault, dear Brutus, is not in the stars, but in cable news networks, according to Poniewozik's astute take on how the format has changed — and perhaps wrecked — our political culture. "I think that whether you want to call it blame or credit, cable news may have a bigger responsibility for what politics is like than any other factor in our society. Certainly Fox News has basically created the tone of the conservative movement for the past two decades. It has created this assault on the idea of objective truth outside of Fox News. And it has contributed to this polarization and the reaction against it on the left." But all cable-news networks are required to fill their airtime with news, whether or not something newsworthy is happening, a road paved with sensationalism, conflict and the exacerbation of viewer emotions. And as Poniewozik illustrates, dramatic sagas of the late 2000s like Octomom and Balloon Boy merged reality TV and cable news into an exploitative hybrid.
5. Michigan and Ted Nugent Poniewozik weighs in on Trump's "Make America Great Again" messaging with a passage that takes a hard look at his the author's hometown region. "To have grown up in southeast Michigan was to have grown up in a culture soaked in nostalgia," he writes. "It was to hear, generation after generation, about how life was better before you were born, when the car factories were pumping out Fords and Chevys and paychecks." It also was to see "nostalgia gone ugly and curdled in Ted Nugent — the deer-hunting, used-to-be rock star who once called Barack Obama a 'subhuman mongrel' — and to know the dog-whistle tune Nugent was playing when he opened an election-eve Trump rally in Sterling Heights, insulting black former Detroit mayors, longing for "the real Michigan ... the old, real Michigan" from when he was born in 1948 and asking, "Are there enough working-hard, playing-hard, American Michigan (profanity) kickers to take this state back and vote Trump for president?'"
6. A prediction for 2021 Let's imagine it's 2021. What will Trump's role on TV be then? Still tweeting from the White House? Running a Trump cable news network out of office? Poniewozik has one safe bet after thinking about Trump's social media war with Debra Messing during Hurricane Dorian: "In 2021, Donald Trump is going to be on Twitter feuding with former sitcom stars and complaining about ratings and obsessing over what's going on at Fox News. The catch is he's going to be doing it whether he's president or not. That's my prediction."

Texto completo: A new report by the Census Bureau affirms that the health care policy being pursued by President Donald Trump and his Republican allies in Congress is working as intended: The number of Americans who lacked health insurance rose last year for the first time since the Affordable Care Act became law in 2010.
About 27.5 million Americans went without health insurance for all of 2018. That’s 8.5% of the population, up from 7.9% percent the previous year. Before the ACA was passed, establishing new insurance markets and providing financial subsidies, more than 15% lacked coverage.
Admittedly, it is hard to fathom why it would be the policy of any political party to deprive people of the means to obtain health care, but it is hard to reach any other conclusion under the circumstances.
The New York Times reports that among the steps the Trump administration has taken to undermine the ACA are these: Cutting back on the advertising and enrollment assistance that helps low-income people learn about their insurance options and exercise them; announcing that Medicaid enrollment would be held against immigrants seeking citizenship or green cards; ending a subsidy program, which in turn contributed to big price increases in the marketplaces in many areas; urging states to bring greater scrutiny to bear on Medicaid eligibility, creating new layers of red tape that may have suppressed enrollment. (And perhaps led some states to enact work requirements such as the ones imposed in New Hampshire, which are currently stayed by a federal judge).
Republicans in Congress played their role in the 2017 tax giveaway by abolishing the individual mandate that required people to obtain coverage or pay a fine. Although that provision didn’t kick in until this year, publicity about it is thought to have played a role in people abandoning their insurance coverage.
The trend reversal in the number of people with coverage is especially striking in that it occurred in the midst of an economic boom and very low unemployment. Normally, health coverage increases when the good economic times are rolling, because employer-based coverage increases — and most Americans get health insurance coverage through the workplace. What happens when the next recession comes along and the employment numbers shrink?
A separate report this month by the Government Accountability Office demonstrated what many have long suspected: that wealthy people live longer than poor people. The link between greater wealth and income and increased longevity was studied among people born between 1931 and 1941. Nearly 75% of those with incomes in the top 20% of mid-career earnings were still alive in 2014, compared with just 52% of those in the bottom 20% of mid-career earnings. Certainly, many reasons contribute to such a disparity, but who can doubt that lack of access to health care accounts for a big part of it?
Democratic presidential candidates are debating whether the right course is to shore up the Affordable Care Act, which is imperfect but has been effective, or to move to a universal health care system. There are good arguments for and against each.
By contrast, we are as yet unaware of a serious Trump health care plan or any proposal for an alternative to Obamacare that enjoys broad support among Republicans in Congress, other than to cripple it or nullify it through the courts. There are no good arguments for that approach.

Texto completo: For months, they’ve been waiting for Joe Biden to collapse. Old Joe. Sputtering Joe. The Septuagenarian Slug. He’s That Seventies Show. The woke Democratic caucus waits for him to forget a name, or mistake his cellphone for the remote. Ditto the woke press. He mentioned “record player,” for God’s sake, answering a question about racism!
Keep waiting. In a debate where Democrats finally went there on guns, saying what most Americans already believe — “Hell, yes, we’re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,” said Beto O’Rourke, in the line of the night — they finally went there on the big Biden question: his age.
The takedown couldn’t come from fellow 70-somethings, Sens. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Sanders’ voice was in the key of gravel, making his Brooklyn accent more distracting than normal when he shouted, “We can do mo-wah!” And Warren was on her best behavior.
So the dirty work fell to Julián Castro, the former Obama Cabinet member. He got right to it with an opening jab against “old ideas,” and then a direct slap, asking Biden: “Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago?” Um, no.
It was a big backfire, a cheap shot that fell to the floor. But it did finally bring out into the open the “ism” that dare not speak its name. You’ll hear plenty more of it, much of it coming from the infantile 73-year-old president, who, just this week, seemed to forget that he had a son with his third wife.
Age itself is not the problem. Winston Churchill was in his mid-70s when he became, for a second time, Britain’s prime minister. Konrad Adenauer served as chancellor of postwar Germany well into his 80s. And how old was Nelson Mandela when he took office as South Africa’s first black president? He was 75.
But age will be the weapon that Biden’s opponents will use, because it’s basically all they have.
Biden is running as a normal guy. Normal is dull. It stirs no blood. Normal is not having to worry about who’s piloting the plane; it’ll land. Uncle Joe is comfort food, the “Home is the place where, when you have to go there, They have to take you in,” in Robert Frost’s words.
But can normal be transformative? Is it enough to say that our long national nightmare is over, as people work through the post-traumatic stress syndromes that’ll be left behind by Donald Trump?
Biden’s persistent big lead in the polls over Trump is your answer. So what if he repeats “battle for the soul of America” in framing the election over and over. It is. In the Trump era, a majority will choose avuncular over authoritarian any day.
Biden took his energy drink, or something. He came out on fire. He was sober, direct, returning volleys from the two lefties on either side of him. “For a socialist, you have a lot more faith in corporate America than I do,” he said to Sanders.
But a half-hour into this third Democratic debate, many Democrats had to be wondering: Can he go three hours? It’s our own collective ageism.
He did, closing with his most appealing side: his humanity and vulnerability. After the El Paso shootings, Trump showed he couldn’t even pass the base test of a human being, demonstrating a smidgen of empathy. He couldn’t even fake it. Not for a minute. Biden bleeds empathy. What’s appealing about him is what my colleague Jennifer Senior called “the bartender aspect” of his character, in her review of his book on the loss of his son Beau.
Progressives looking for someone who will bring big structural changes should remember that we are electing not just a president, but an executive branch. I have no doubt that Biden would sign any kind of advanced legislation that can get by the Neanderthals holding the Senate back in the last century.
Waiting for Uncle Joe to collapse is not a winning strategy. Most of the other candidates in Thursday’s debate seemed to get that. O’Rourke had his best night. This is the rare politician who’s not afraid to let it rip, the b.s. valve turned off. Kamala Harris is brilliant and would crush Trump in a debate. “You can go back to watching Fox News,” was her line that should be on bumper stickers soon. And on the shootings, she said of Trump: “He didn’t pull the trigger, but he’s certainly been tweeting out the ammunition.”
For the two of them, though, it may too late: both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump led at this stage in the polls four years ago.
Pete Buttigieg, born in 1982, nearly a decade after Biden entered the Senate, makes a pitch for generational change, citing John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. He’s got the right song in the wrong presidential year. Remember the guy who specifically called for passing the generational torch in an earlier debate? Me neither. (It was Rep. Eric Swalwell.)
Cory Booker, another man of reason and intellect stuck in a politician’s body, inadvertently gave Biden some cover, the raison d’être for his candidacy. “We’ve got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president.” That’s the calculation most Democrats are making as well, and why Biden is the likely nominee.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Pentagon is preparing to send about 150 troops to northeastern Syria to conduct ground patrols with Turkish forces, reversing at least temporarily a withdrawal from Syria that President Donald Trump ordered in December.
The new troop deployment, which has not been previously reported, is part of an expanding series of military and diplomatic steps the United States has taken in recent weeks to defuse escalating tensions with Turkey, a NATO ally, over U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish fighters. Those fighters led the ground war against the Islamic State, a shared enemy, but Turkey considers them terrorists.
The United States currently has just under 1,000 troops in Syria, mainly to help stamp out remaining pockets of Islamic State fighters.
Turkey threatened last month to invade northeast Syria to rout the Syrian Kurds from territory along the border they seized from the Islamic State group. In response, the Pentagon in recent weeks has rushed to both set up joint reconnaissance flights and ground patrols with Turkish forces in a narrow buffer zone inside Syria, and destroy Kurdish fortifications near the border that Turkey considered threatening. Two senior American generals met this week with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara, Turkey's capital.
Taken together, the measures seek to prevent the war-ravaged region from sinking deeper into turmoil, which in turn could jeopardize efforts to fend off a resurgent guerrilla campaign by Islamic State fighters and imperil Trump's plan to withdraw most American troops from Syria by next year.
The future of northeastern Syria is just one area in which Turkey and the United States have engaged in contentious discussions.
The White House informed Turkey in July that the United States would not sell it F-35 stealth fighter jets, in retaliation for Turkey's $2.5 billion purchase of Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems. The sale has also heightened the possibility of long-threatened U.S. sanctions being imposing against a fellow member of NATO.
The United States and Turkey agreed in principle last month to establish a jointly patrolled zone for refugees along the border, but they are still negotiating the details, and major differences remain.

Millennials are taking over fashion, too

Texto completo: In the fall of 2018, Jean-Philippe Hecquet, the newly installed chief executive of Lanvin, was looking for a designer to save the oldest French fashion house in continuous existence. The stakes were high. The brand's collections had been critically savaged since parting ways with Alber Elbaz, its former creative director, in 2015.
It had quickly run through two other creative directors without success, and sales were plummeting. The house had a new owner, the Chinese group Fosun International, and it wanted a turnaround before Lanvin drifted off to the land of irrelevance. So what did Hecquet do?
Cherchez the millennial.
He hired Bruno Sailelli, age 31. Hecquet made a big bet on a very young, unproven name. And in doing so, he became the latest in a growing group of established brands to hand the keys to the creative kingdom to a new generation of designers.
Aside from Sailelli at Lanvin, in the last year alone Daniel Lee became creative director of Bottega Veneta at age 32 (he is now 33); Daniel Roseberry joined Schiaparelli, age 33; and Rushemy Botter and Lisi Herrebrugh landed at Nina Ricci, ages 36 and 29. Then Rihanna, 31, became the first creative to get a new label at LVMH since 1987.
They joined a club that includes Jonathan Anderson at Loewe (35), Francesco Risso at Marni (36), Julien Dossena at Paco Rabanne (36) and Olivier Rousteing at Balmain (33).
The buzziest names of fashion month, which begins this week in New York before rolling out to London, Milan and Paris, are all under 35: Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss (32), Telfar Clemens (34) and Brandon Maxwell (34), the Council of Fashion Designers of America Womenswear Designer of the Year 2019, in New York; Grace Wales Bonner in London (27); and Simon Porte Jacquemus (29) and Marine Serre (27) in Paris.
"The new luxury has brought a major aesthetic discontinuity, which is getting some brands and designers out of sync with the Zeitgeist," Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at Bernstein, wrote in an email. "This has been driven by younger consumers embracing a more informal definition of fashion. This is also producing a generation shift in the designer ranks."
Fashion loves a trend, not to mention a new discovery, and it's possible that this is simply the latest example. But the sheer number of designers of a certain age range, and the span of countries and kinds of brands they now run, suggests the change may be more systemic in nature; may, in fact, signify a meaningful shift in the demographics of fashion power.
Gen Y has reached critical mass. And that has repercussions not only for consumers and the industry, but also for the Gen X creatives who came before.
Younger, younger, younger
"They always want younger, younger younger," one headhunter in Paris said of the fashion executives for whom he worked. (The New York Times agreed to grant him anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject.) "We have put forth talent in their mid-50s who were exceptional, and they were summarily rejected."
Fashion - even the most expensive, traditional kind - has long had a yen for the disruptive stylings of youth; has long been mining their wardrobe reinventions for ideas. But this development is less about aesthetics than behavior and points of view. And it is part of a historical pattern.
There have been such tectonic shifts before: times when major groupings of designers seemed to arrive en masse, as opposed to the lone breakthroughs of wunderkind outliers like Yves Saint Laurent, who took the reins at Dior at age 21.
Often they rode the wave of broader social movements: in the 1960s, the youthquake was given shape by Mary Quant, Andre Courreges and Betsey Johnson; in the '90s, the YBDs (young British designers), John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney, took over the French establishment at the time of Cool Britannia.
"Fashion has its own class system, and this is what I call the fourth class: the youth," said Colin McDowell, the author of "McDowell's Directory of 20th Century Fashion." "They rise up every few decades."
The main forces driving the move this time are the rise of the millennial consumer and the technological transformation of 2007, when the smart-phone - and many of the social media platforms it enabled - emerged, changing human interaction just when Gen Y was entering its majority.
Yet no executive or head-hunter will acknowledge that fashion brands increasingly see age as a criterion for hiring a designer, for understandable legal reasons. Rather, they discuss the importance of "digital," of "having a community," of "a willingness to change," of understanding that the world now wants not so much "beautiful products" as "beautiful products that reflect values."
There's no question that such qualifications can be found in designers of any age. Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, is one of the pacesetters for the industry, and he's 47. But there is also no question that these are values most often associated with millennials.
'You don't need to train them or teach them or force them'
Gen-Yers don't necessarily make different clothes - or not dramatically different clothes. They aren't the so-called streetwear generation (Gen X is actually behind a lot of that - at least the commercial exploitation of it) or the gender-fluid generation. But they do think about how those clothes reach the end user in different ways, and they do talk about them differently, and see their roles differently.
So when Fran�ois-Henri Pinault, the chief executive of Kering, which owns Bottega Veneta, was interviewing designers for the top job at that brand and wanted to speak to them about sustainability, he said that what struck him about Lee was that, "it is a given."
"He didn't even understand why we were asking him about it," Pinault said. He also said that when they first spoke, Lee didn't even talk about products - just the abstract meaning of the brand.
Similarly, Hecquet of Lanvin noted that designers who grew up in the social media age are "digitally savvy."
"The way they think, the way they operate in their personal lives, there is less resistance to the way of communicating on social networks," he said. "You don't need to train them or teach them or force them - it's natural, and customers can feel that."
It's no accident that Olivier Rousteing of Balmain was among the first major designers to have a public personal Instagram profile, or that Daniel Roseberry staged his first show for Schiaparelli by plunking himself down in the middle of his runway, sketching, instead of hiding mysteriously backstage. People were wondering who the new guy they had never heard of was? Well, there he was! Check him out.
"For many candidates, the number of followers is a key part of their resume," said Michael Boroian, the founder of the executive search firm Sterling International, which specializes in the luxury industry.
Also, of course, relatively young, untested designers tend to be cheaper, at a time when geopolitics and the possibility of a recession are sending tremors through the industry.
"The existing creative directors have been making a ton of money," Boroian said. "One of the people I know was on an 8-million-euro package. The new crew tends to go from 500,000 euros to 2 million, though the latter would have to have a following, so from the very beginning their name would be a mover of product. But the compensation structure is less onerous for the brand. And in return, they get loyalty."
In fact, a brand gets more than that: It also gets a name that will not overshadow the brand name, because most of these designers were second in command, working behind the scenes before being elevated. And, said Hecquet: "They don't have any bad or comfortable habits. They are not used to having a huge team."
They are not committed to a two-season cycle, private planes and yachts, sable and vicuna. They are relaxed about the idea of change. Disruption for them is business as usual.
Follow the money
In addition, as Achim Berg, the head of McKinsey & Co.'s apparel, fashion and luxury group, noted, "younger designers are closer to the consumer." This may seem obvious, but given the potential pitfalls involved in opting for an unknown, it's also risky.
That is why big brands like Dior and Givenchy often stick to bignames like Maria Grazia Chiuri and Clare Waight Keller, both of whom are Gen X designers and had proven track records at the top of other brands (Chiuri at Valentino and Keller at Chloe).
Choosing to turn the generation wheel adds a dimension of "is he up to the job?" scrutiny to the work of designers who are already under significant pressure to reinvent an aesthetic, not to mention lead groups of people who may often be older than them.
Still, the millennial consumer has become the market every brand wants to own, and it is possible that the millennial designer is the fastest, most effective way into their mindset and wallet.
"Millennials are a key audience for today and tomorrow," Hecquet said. "Not the only one, but for sure it helps to have a young designer because the way he does Mings will naturally attract the younger consumer."
"They don't just buy products, they are buying a message," Hecquet continued. "That's what you need to build a movement." (This is especially important if a brand has lost much of its identity.) "The new generation wants to see the back story, they want to know who a designer is. He is the face of a brand, so, of course, having a 31-year-old brings a new audience."
This is even more crucial when it comes to China, which despite trade wars and political tension, is for many brands still the promised land of future growth, and where millennials are the highest-spending age group. According to McKinsey's 2019 China Luxury Report, the approximately 10.2 million Chinese millennial luxury consumers are the "driving force of the country's luxury appetite," accounting for more than half the total spending on luxury in 2018 - which is to say, more than half of the $115 billion spent at home and abroad.
By 2025, Chinese consumers are expected to account for 40% of worldwide luxury spending. In the United States, millennials accounted for approximately $200 billion in consumer spending in 2018, according to McKinsey. Ka-ching.
The Gen X puzzle
Combined with fashion's own desire for change and freshness, be it in garments, retail strategy or actual employees, this has created an environment increasingly receptive to the idea of looking past the usual names - those that have been, for the last few years, on the short list for every job that opened up at a big brand.
It also explains why they may have been bypassed in the end. Gen X designers, after all, were forged in a time when luxury had a different understanding of its own identity.
"For years the sense of purpose of a brand could be implicit in exquisite bags and clothes, but today, because of the global challenges, companies need to be very explicit about their sense of purpose," Pinault said. "And I think this means more and more young designers will appear. They get that." (That said, it is worth pointing out that the corporate side of things is still dominated by Gen Xers and boomers).
McDowell believes the momentum may be irrevocable, and that while designers in their late 40s and 50s are no longer the names of first resort, they will still be in demand for the one-off collaboration and guest star role. But 'are they going to get another big job?" he said. "No. I don't think so."
There will be exceptions, of course, but the physics of fashion are working against them, as is the industry's deep-seated and defining desire for newness. It's part of the myth that fashion tells itself about itself. And now it's reality.
"I don't regret for a minute taking this risk," Hecquet said.

So it was for Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, the New York Times reporters who, along with Ronan Farrow in the New Yorker, broke the Harvey Weinsten sexual-abuse story, leading to, among other things, #MeToo, the firings of many high-profile men, the horrifying drama of the Bret Kavanaugh hearings and, at the very least, a greater awareness of the widespread, systemically supported and always devastating nature of sexual harassment.
Now Kantor and Twohey have written "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Unite a Movement" (Penguin Press) to tell us, in fascinating detail and with a remarkably ego-free eye on the story's enormous impact, how they did it.

It is a binge-read of a book, propelled, for the most part, by a clear, adrenaline-spiking ticktock of how their stories came together, and studded with all manner of new astonishing details (R.I.P. the careers of attorneys Lisa Bloom and David Boies.)
As with "All the President's Men," in whose company it now stands, the action in "She Said" began with a seemingly small, albeit disturbing, event. For Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, it was a break-in at the Democratic headquarters in D.C.'s Watergate building; for Times reporters Kantor and Twohey it was a tweet from actress Rose McGowan claiming that she had been raped by a Hollywood producer.
As with the Watergate break-in, many American journalists were aware, or became aware, of the tweet. Some dismissed it as just one more instance of McGowan, known then as a promising actor whose career had somehow derailed, trolling Hollywood. Others made an effort to follow it up; there was a general assumption that McGowan was referring to Harvey Weinstein, who had long been suspected of, at best, a sleazy penchant for hooking up with young female stars, and at worst, predatory behavior. Certain reporters had been trying to investigate Weinstein for years.
But McGowan, it appeared, wasn't talking beyond the tweet.
Kantor and Twohey were just like all those journalists with a few notable exceptions: They each had backgrounds in top-tier investigative journalism, often done on the behalf of women; they worked for a paper that had the resources to allow them to pursue their leads (occasionally internationally) and they simply refused to give up.
Mostly, it came down to persistence. The agonizing over the wording in email requests, the repeated phone messages, the willingness to knock on the doors of women who had not answered either, the "Columbo"-like "Can you just tell me..." ability to get and keep people talking (even in one case when their editor in chief had told them not to talk to anyone in the Weinstein camp off the record) long enough to reveal even one more lead.
Kantor got McGowan to talk, albeit off the record, and her editor, Rebecca Corbett, suggested she broaden her scope and try to find other women who might have also been assaulted by Weinstein. Corbett also put her in contact with Twohey. Though still recovering from childbirth and the fallout from working on a series about women who accused then-candidate Donald Trump of sexual aggression (hint: she became a a target of public vitriol from Trump and Bill O'Reilly, soon to be fired for multiple allegations of sexual harassment), she agreed to help.
Neither of them had any Hollywood contacts, which was a blessing -- no history with the whole Weinstein myth/machine (at one point, one of their editors wondered if anyone would care since he was not that famous) -- and a curse -- no contacts.
Slowly but surely that changed. Columnist Nicholas Kristof put them in touch with actress Ashley Judd, which would prove invaluable; another source led them to Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham, who "became a two-woman celebrity switchboard" of contact information, including Gwyneth Paltrow, who had her own Weinstein story, off the record of course. Paltrow began reaching out to other women she knew, or suspected, had been abused by the producer.
The stories Kantor and Twohey collected are familiar to anyone who followed the investigation, but to see them as they saw them, piling up in a sickening pattern (the hotel room, the bathrobe, the demand for a massage, the groping, the rape or assault, the promises, the threats, the payoff) from a wide array of women remains a gut-punch.
For the two reporters it was a double gut-punch because a year or so into the investigation they had no one on the record. Each woman either felt bound by a confidentiality agreement or too afraid of Weinstein's reach to go public. With very good reason. Weinstein may not have been at the zenith of his influence but he remained, as the two reporters quickly learned, aggressively defensive, a famously uncontrollable man whom the entertainment industry had granted the ability to make or break a career. With deep pockets and rabidly fierce lawyers, he was willing to threaten just about anything to protect his image.
For months, Kantor and Twohey could do nothing about what they knew.
Not that there is much, or any really, reportorial hand-wringing in "She Said." No complaints about missing kids' bedtimes or self-portraits in noir of the nights spent staking out sources amid messy boxes of Chinese takeout. No scenes when one or the other says "Dammit, you should have talked to me first" or wondering if this undertaking is worth it. No "You're on the wrong side of history" showdown with a source or an editor. There are a few actual showdowns -- Weinstein presents himself at the Times' offices more than once -- and plenty of pulse-racing excitement in "She Said," but all of it is organic to the story rather than the storytellers.
This is an account, not a memoir. The narrative (which is written in third person) acknowledges the frustration, mostly in moments when one editor or another says, "There is no story yet." But whatever Kantor or Twohey felt during this time is left to the imagination; they are far more interested, still, in telling the story of how one man allegedly abused so many women and got away with it for so long.
Until they figured out the way to expose that.
While the two were investigating Weinstein, the New York Times broke the story of the millions of dollars Fox had paid to women O'Reilly had allegedly abused. Like Woodward and Bernstein before them, Kantor and Twohey realized they too could follow the money.
Which led them to nondisclosure agreements and legal deniability supported by a phalanx of lawyers and executives, including and especially Harvey's brother Bob, who used payouts as a way of making a "problem" go away without ever having to fully admit what the "problem" was or hear about it ever again.
It also led them to Irwin Reiter, a very worried Weinstein executive who, in a scene that is pure Hollywood, leaked a damning memo. The reporters finally had a story that didn't require a reluctant woman to go on the record (although, in the eleventh hour and another Hollywood moment, Judd agreed.)
And they knew it was a good story by the way Weinstein and his team responded -- threatening, cajoling, whining -- up until the very moments before their editor hit publish.
I don't want to spoil any details or steal any thunder because this is Kantor and Twohey's story and one everyone should read it for a panoply of reasons.
By simply recounting their reporting, the two offer a masterful explanation of how a man like Weinstein is allowed to abuse his power and many women for so long in something approaching plain sight (that so many of the people Kantor and Twohey spoke with seemed to assume that women willingly trade sex for career advancement in Hollywood is chilling).
They have also documented the long-exposure process of courage. Bravery is not a characteristic so much as it is a journey, and for each woman involved, the decision to tell her story was difficult to excruciating. But eventually they did it anyway.
"She Said" reminds us how difficult, tedious, frightening, frustrating and important the work of journalism remains. Kantor and Twohey, and then Farrow with whom they shared the 2018 Pulitzer for public service, broke the Weinstein story because they worked the Weinstein story. Tirelessly, doggedly, from any angle they or their editors could think of. Like "All the President's Men," the film of which spawned a generation of journalism students, a story like this proves the importance of skilled reporting and platforms that can afford to focus on months/years-long investigations (and send their reporters to, say, Wales.)
And in many ways, "She Said" is more significant than "All the President's Men," and not just because journalism is currently under siege, financially and politically in a way it was not in the 1970s. There was a finite number of people responsible for the crimes of the Nixon administration; the alleged crimes of Harvey Weinstein are also the crimes of our culture, and they continue to be committed every day by many men all around the world.
Although now, one hopes, without as much silence, secrecy and cultural complacency.
"She Said" is not a perfect book. It wanders a bit toward the end as the two attempt to examine the impact of #MeToo with a timeline of the Christine Blasey Ford story, which they reported on but at a distance, and, for the final chapter, a gathering of 12 of the women who had been part of their reporting to a gathering at, well, yes it must be said, Paltrow's house. Here the reporters' voice, which works so well throughout much of the book, falls a bit short. It would have been nice to feel that Kantor and Twohey were part of this conversation rather than simply recording it, and by ending with each woman given a final say, the book concedes its own.
But that's OK; certainly after years of silence, each deserves to be an equal part of a final chapter, and it is impossible to write about how an avalanche ended while the mountains continue to fall.
Just before reading "She Said," I watched the upcoming Netflix drama "Unbelievable." It's an adaptation of another Pulitzer Prize winning work, a ProPublica series about Marie, a young woman who after being raped was so disbelieved that she recanted her testimony, and the pair of female investigators who brought down a serial rapist and proved he attacked her.
Hard not to see a parallel.
At the end (I don't think this is a spoiler because the story won a Pulitzer), Marie thanks the detectives for proving that the world is not filled with terrible people; there are also people who want to help and who will work hard and tirelessly to do so.
As a woman and a journalist, I would like to take a moment to thank Kantor and Twohey for pretty much the same thing.

Texto completo: Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
By Christopher Flavelle
When the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration rebuked its own meteorologists on Friday for contradicting President Trump, the uproar that followed demonstrated more than the usual concern over political interference in science.
That pushback, which now includes inquiries from both Congress and the inspector general responsible for NOAA, reflects a deeper anxiety: The notion that one of the country's leading science agencies, which has thus far received more autonomy from Mr. Trump's White House than other parts of the federal government, might now be losing that autonomy.
To recap: On Sept. 1, the president wrote on Twitter that Alabama "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated." A few minutes later, the National Weather Service in Birmingham posted a message on Twitter saying that "Alabama will NOT see any impacts from Dorian." NOAA, which oversees the weather service, issued a statement on Sept. 6 rebuking the Birmingham office.
The New York Times reported Wednesday that NOAA's statement came at the behest of the White House.
Understanding the furor of the past few days requires an understanding of NOAA's role and its importance, especially in measuring what's happening to the planet. Its centrality to climate research could be calculated in many ways, including the steady stream of climate-related science it has continued to produce. The agency puts out an annual Global Climate Report, and told the public just a few weeks ago that this July was the hottest on record.
That work continued long after the Environmental Protection Agency took down the climate page on its website "to reflect E.P.A.'s priorities under the leadership of President Trump." It continued after the United States Geological Survey was instructed to stop projecting the impact of climate change after 2040, when the most severe impacts are expected. It continued after the head of the Climate and Health Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention filed a whistle blower complaint that alleged retaliation for speaking out on climate change.
NOAA's independence is partly structural, according to current and former staff members and outside experts. Unlike the E.P.A. and many other agencies, NOAA isn't primarily a regulatory agency (the regulations it does handle mainly concern fisheries). That means there are few businesses with a financial stake in weakening the agency or limiting its authority.
Culture matters, too. NOAA's scientists, and the career staff members who oversee them, have a reputation for fiercely guarding the agency's independence. They seem to feel they've been successful. Last year, the Union of Concerned Scientists asked more than 63,000 scientists at 16 federal agencies to gauge their perceived independence; of the scientists at NOAA who responded, two-thirds agreed with the statement that the agency "adheres to its scientific integrity policy."
For most of the time Mr. Trump has been president, in other words, NOAA has flown under the radar.
That changed during the past 10 days, as the agency's skill at avoiding the political spotlight was eclipsed by Mr. Trump's refusal to admit that he was wrong, coupled with the lengths to which his White House proved willing to go to reset the record.
The question that remains is whether this episode will inflict a sufficiently high price on Mr. Trump to restore the measure of autonomy that NOAA once enjoyed, in this and future administrations. The answer to that question will depend partly on the findings of the two inquiries -- one by the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, the other from the inspector general at the Department of Commerce.
But it will also depend on the strength of the perception, by scientists and the broader public, that meddling with NOAA is beyond the bounds of whatever constitutes acceptable political behavior.
"There is a price to pay for compromising NOAA's independence," said Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The public is clamoring for information it can trust."

Installing solar panels is expensive, but if you have the money, now might be the time to act. That's because the investment tax credit, which offers significant deductions for installing a solar energy system, is set to expire soon.
If your system is hooked up and running before the end of the year, you'll be able to deduct 30 percent of the installation costs from your tax bill. In 2020, the tax credit will fall to 26 percent. In 2021, it drops to 22 percent, and, in 2022, it will be phased out for residential customers.
Congress could decide to renew the program, of course. Abigail Ross Hopper, chief executive of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group, said she was "cautiously optimistic" that the tax credit would be extended.
Still, she said, the remainder of this year is when you can be sure to earn the largest possible deduction.
Because it can take several weeks to shop around and schedule an installation, and several more for your utility company to connect you to the grid, you should get started soon.
First, determine whether you have adequate space, and sunlight, on your roof or in your backyard. Then, consider the cost. The average solar installation, after tax credits, runs roughly between $ 10,850 and $ 14,200, depending on location, size and whether you opt for a top-of-the-line system. (This calculator allows you to estimate costs and 20-year net savings, as well as compare quotes.)
Vikram Aggarwal, chief executive of EnergySage, a solar comparison-shopping service, said you'd generate the greatest long-term savings by purchasing your system outright. If you can't afford that, the next best move would be to get financing through a credit union, home equity loan or line of credit. You could also apply for a loan through a government-backed program like FHA Title I or NY-Sun.
While many solar installation companies offer loans, they usually have higher fees and interest rates.
Leasing a solar energy system, Mr. Aggarwal said, isn't as popular anymore, in part because the price of solar has dropped 70 percent over the past decade and in part because leasing precludes you from claiming the investment tax credit. Most leases also come with an "escalator" that raises electricity rates on an annual basis.
When you buy with cash or a loan, on the other hand, you'll benefit from fixed electricity costs over your system's lifetime, usually in the range of 20 to 30 years. And, in addition to the federal tax credit, you might be eligible for state incentive programs. Enter your ZIP code into the DSIRE database to see what's available. (Worth noting: Condo owners can claim the investment tax credit for their share of the costs when their homeowners association goes solar.)
"The system will actually pay for itself in a reasonable amount of time," said Parth Vaishnav, an assistant research professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University. The average payback period, according to the Center for Sustainable Energy, is six to nine years. In some cases, Dr. Vaishnav said, you could also recover a portion of your costs through an increase in home value.
Lest you forget, solar panels help the climate, too. "On average, every residential solar panel system is almost like planting between 100 and 200 trees -- every year," Mr. Aggarwal said. "It is a very, very meaningful carbon offset."

Jockey Club: Justify clean for Preakness

Texto completo: A day after the New York Times reported that 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify tested positive for a banned substance in the run-up to the Kentucky Derby, the Maryland Jockey Club said that the Bob Baffert-trained colt was clean in pre- and post-race drug tests for the 143rd Preakness.
Earlier Thursday, Churchill Downs Racetrack released a similar statement saying that Justify had come up clean on pre- and post-race tests for the 2018 Kentucky Derby.
The Times reported that Justify tested positive for the banned substance Scopolamine after his victory in the Santa Anita Derby on April 7, 2018. If he had been disqualified from that prep race, he would not have qualified for the Kentucky Derby field.
The Times reported that the California Horse Racing Board dismissed the case four months later in a closed-door session.
Baffert released a statement Thursday saying he did not give Scopolamine to Justify and blaming the positive test on "environmental contamination" related to jimson weed, "a naturally growing substance in areas where hay and straw are produced in California."
W. Craig Robertson III, an attorney for Baffert, also issued a statement criticizing the Times story as "long on sensationalism, short on facts."
The Maryland Jockey Club statement read: "Justify, as with every horse who raced in the 2018 Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, MD, was subjected to pre-race drug testing by the Maryland Racing Commission. Justify, as the winner of the 143rd Preakness, along with several other horses who competed, also received extensive post-race testing by that same body. The Maryland Jockey Club was informed that all of those tests came back negative for any illicit substance or for the overages of any prohibited medication."

Texto completo: McIlroy surprised by player of year award
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. - Rory McIlroy is the PGA Tour Player of the Year, and even he was a little surprised.
In a vote of the players, who presumably gave as much weight to the whole season as the four biggest weeks, McIlroy won the Jack Nicklaus Award over Brooks Koepka. It was the third time McIlroy won the award, and the first time without having won a major.
"I'm at a loss for words," McIlroy said Wednesday.
Moments earlier, McIlroy was sitting down with Nicklaus at The Bear's Club in South Florida to receive the Byron Nelson Trophy for having the lowest adjusted scoring average when a bronze of the Nicklaus Award was placed on the table. McIlroy looked at it and said, "I've already got two of those," he said.
"Well, you've got three now," Nicklaus told him.
McIlroy won three times, including The Players Championship and the Tour Championship to capture the FedEx Cup and its $15 million prize. He also had a tour-best 14 top 10s.

HORSERACING
Report: Justify failed drug test
NEW YORK - The New York Times said Justify won the 2018 Triple Crown after a failed postrace drug test at a California track that could have kept the horse out of the Kentucky Derby.
The newspaper reported Wednesday that Bob Baffert-trained Justify tested positive for the drug scopolamine after winning the Santa Anita Derby, one of the final prep races for the Kentucky Derby. Justify went on to win the Derby and took the Preakness and Belmont stakes to complete the Triple Crown.
The Times said instead of a speedy disqualification, the California Horse Racing Board took more than a month to confirm the results. The newspaper also reported that instead of filing a public complaint, the board made decisions behind closed doors as it moved to drop the case and lighten the penalty for horses found to have scopolamine in their systems.

PRO BASKETBALL
Delle Donne earns top WNBA honor
NEW YORK - Elena Delle Donne put together a historic season in Washington and has been named the Associated Press WNBA Player of the Year.
Delle Donne became the first WNBA player to shoot over 50% from the field (51.5%), 40% from behind the 3-point line (43%) and 90% from the foul line (97.4%). Only eight NBA players have accomplished that milestone. She helped the Mystics finish with the best record in the league and the top overall seed in the playoffs.
Napheesa Collier edged Arike Ogunbowale for Rookie of the Year.
Phoenix center Brittney Griner returned to start the second half with a brace on her left knee after injuring it in the second quarter of the Mercury's first-round playoff game against Chicago on Wednesday night.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Oklahoma State superfan dies at 91
T. Boone Pickens was known as one of the world's richest men.
He also was known as the ultimate Oklahoma State superfan, a man whose choice to generously spend his wealth on his alma mater fueled the football program's return to national prominence. Pickens died Wednesday in Dallas at age 91, his spokesman, Jay Rosser, said.
Pickens said last month in his annual letter to Oklahoma State fans that he checked with the school and learned he had donated $652 million over the years, with much of it going to athletic facilities.
Florida State is hiring former Oregon defensive coordinator Jim Leavitt as an analyst to help fix a flailing defense, a person involved with the decision said.
Tennessee cornerback Bryce Thompson has returned to practice less than three weeks after his arrest on a misdemeanor domestic assault charge.

Steelers lineman Davis dies at 75
PITTSBURGH - Sam Davis, the guard who helped the Pittsburgh Steelers win four Super Bowls in the 1970s, has died. He was 75.
Davis was found dead Tuesday at New Life Personal Care in McKeesport, southeast of Pittsburgh. Davis, who suffered from dementia and was legally blind, had been reported missing from the facility earlier in the day. There was no evidence of foul play, according to the McKeesport Police Department's Facebook page.
Davis played 168 games with the Steelers from 1967-79, helping pave the way for Hall of Fame running back Franco Harris and protecting Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw during Pittsburgh's run atop the NFL in the 1970s. Davis started in all four of the team's' Super Bowl victories in the 1970s.
Former University of Arkansas, University of Michigan and NFL quarterback Ryan Mallett has been arrested in northwest Arkansas on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Springdale police Lt. Jeff Taylor said the 31-year-old Mallett was arrested Tuesday following a two-vehicle collision.

Texto completo: The Guthrie has added three more events that explore the Arab experience to its 2019-20 season, bringing the total (so far) to five.
Previously announced, New Arab American Theater Works’ production of “Zafira and the Resistance,” written by Minnesota playwright Kathryn Haddad and directed by Malek Najjar and Zeina Salame, will play in the Dowling Studio (Oct. 11-27). Haddad’s play, now in rehearsals, looks at the lives of students and faculty of color in an era of increasing anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim bigotry.
The regional premiere of “Noura” by award-winning playwright Heather Raffo, whose parents are American and Iraqi, will play on the proscenium stage (Jan. 11-Feb. 16). Inspired by Henrik Ibsen’s “A Doll’s House,” it explores motherhood, marriage and identity in modern America through the character of Noura, a newly minted U.S. citizen preparing to host an Iraqi meal on Christmas Eve.
Announced earlier this week, Remote Theater Project’s production of “Grey Rock,” written and directed by Palestinian artist Amir Nizar Zuabi, will be staged in the Dowling Studio (Jan. 23-26). Set in the present day, it tells of an ordinary man in a small West Bank village who is determined to go to the moon and builds a rocket in his shed. The play will be performed in English by a five-member cast from Palestine.
Next in the Dowling Studio (Jan. 29-Feb. 2), the Guthrie will present Hanane Hajj Ali’s one-woman show “Jogging,” conceived and performed in Arabic with English subtitles. The story is told through Ali’s eyes as she takes her daily jog through Beirut, remarking on her surroundings, the city’s history, and her own roles as woman, wife, and mother.
On Jan. 26, the Guthrie will host an “In Conversation” event moderated by Artistic Director Joseph Haj with artists from all four plays, “Zafira and the Resistance,” “Noura,” “Grey Rock” and “Jogging.”
In a statement, Haj said, “So often, our exposure to Arab culture in America is reduced to stories connected to war and politics, but the lives of Arabs and Arab Americans go far beyond the limits of that framework. … We didn’t want a singular story to bear the weight of trying to represent an entire cultural worldview, so we took the opportunity to present multiple tales from the Arab experience.” Haj is the son of parents who emigrated from Palestine in the late 1950s.
Tickets for all but “In Conversation” are on sale now. New this season, ticket prices for plays in the Dowling will be $9 for select performances and regularly priced at $25 or $32 for all other performances.
Weekend events for the M’s new exhibition
Since moving into its permanent home in the Pioneer Endicott Building in December 2018, the Minnesota Museum of American Art has presented three exhibitions. Today (Thursday, Sept. 12) begins the fourth. “History Is Not Here: Art and the Arab Imaginary” may be the M’s boldest statement yet about the boundless (and borderless) diversity of American art. For sure, it’s not what most people would expect to see in a museum of American art in the heart of a Midwestern city.
Co-presented with Mizna, the St. Paul-based Arab arts organization, “History Is Not Here” features work by 17 artists from the so-called “Arab world” who are working in the United States and abroad. It’s eye-opening and stereotypes-busting. We saw a press preview Tuesday and are still processing.
Meanwhile, several events are happening tonight and over the weekend that are good entry points into the show, why it matters, and what it has to say about history, representation/misrepresentation and America’s habit of lumping together (and often vilifying) everyone from Southwest Asia, North Africa and the diaspora. All are free and open to the public, but space is limited and RSVPs are requested.
An opening party tonight will feature a first look, cash bar, and DJ Yasmeenah spinning tunes. Guest curators Heba Y. Amin and Maymanah Farhat will give remarks at 7 p.m. The party starts at 6 p.m. and ends at 9.
Amin and Farhat will return for a curator conversation tomorrow (Friday) moderated by Laura Wertheim Joseph, the M’s new curator of exhibitions. 6 p.m.
On Saturday, Athir Shayota, who has two paintings in the exhibition, will give an artist talk about his experiences as an artist in the Midwest. 1 p.m.
On Sunday, Amin and Farhat will give a curators’ tour of the exhibition, with special insights on the artists, artworks and themes. 1 p.m.
And on Monday, Sept. 16, Sudanese-Norwegian artist Fadlabi – one of 12 artists who are creating murals in St. Paul’s Creative Energy Zone during this year’s inaugural Chroma Zone Mural & Art Festival, taking place right now – will give an artist talk about his process and the content of his mural.
Until Tuesday, Fadlabi’s presence at Chroma Zone was uncertain. Despite his Norwegian citizenship, his Sudanese upbringing delayed his artist visa. But he made it, he’s here, he’s painting and he’ll talk. NOTE: This event will take place at Forecast Public Art, not the M. 7-8:30 p.m.
The picks
Tonight (Thursday, Sept. 12) at Bockley Gallery: Opening reception for “George Morrison.” Ojibwe modernist Morrison was born on Lake Superior’s North Shore in 1919. Celebrating the centennial of his birth, Bockley Gallery has mounted a show of paintings, drawings, prints and sculpture spanning five decades of the artist’s life. The gallery first showed Morrison’s work in the late 1980s and now represents his estate. 5-8 p.m. Closes Oct. 19. FMI.
Starts Friday at the Film Society’s St. Anthony Main Theatre: “Miles Davis: Birth of the Cool.” If you missed Stanley Nelson’s acclaimed documentary when it screened at MSPIFF earlier this year – or if you want to see it again – here’s your chance. The San Francisco Chronicle called it “truthful, gritty, elegantly musical, unpredictable and even surprising.” The narration is in Davis’ own words; Nelson used selections from his colorful autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe, and actor Carl Lumbly performed them. FMI including trailer, times and tickets. The run has already been extended beyond Sept.19. More show times will be added.
Friday and Saturday at the Walker: Nature Theater of Oklahoma and EN-KNAP Group: “Pursuit of Happiness.” The Walker’s 2019-20 performing arts season begins with “one of the wildest things you’ll see at the theater this year” (New York Times). A New York-based theater company and a Slovenian dance company meet up in a Western bar to explore the Declaration of Independence’s “pursuit of happiness” as an “unalienable right” and what that means. Here’s a trailer. With English subtitles. Contains sounds of gunshots and depictions of physical and sexual violence. 8 p.m. FMI and tickets ($28/$22.40 for members).
Friday at SooVAC: Opening reception for “Collect Call.” What do other collectors collect? What draws them, entices them, inspires them? What do they spend their money on? Every other year, SooVAC invites Minnesota collectors to share a portion of their collection with the public. This year’s collectors are Mark Addicks and Tom Hoch, Tom Arneson, Todd Bockley, Chris Barfield and Benjamin Brown, Carlo Cuesta and Dana Gillespie, Kathryn Hanna and Daniel Romero, Michael and Lindsay Herbert, Masami Kawazato and Aaron Merrill, Herman J. Milligan, Jr. and Constance Osterbaan-Milligan, Tom Owens, Phil and Tammie Rosenbloom, Jim Rustad and Kay Thomas, and John and Michael Sammler-Jones. 6-9 p.m. Free. Closes Sept. 29.
Saturday at the Hook and Ladder: Daniel Borzutsky and Steve Healey. A child of Chilean immigrants, Borzutsky is a National Book Award-winning poet and award-winning translator. Healey learned as a child (during the Cold War) that his father was a spy for the CIA. Borzutzky’s poetry deals with the political and economic violence shared by Chile and Chicago, where he now lives and teaches, Healey’s with national and family secrets and a paranoid childhood. Books will be available. Presented by Rain Taxi. 7 p.m. Free. FMI.

Does this Justify a cover-up?

Resumen: A report of a tainted horse race, and a warning issued for charging phones. It's Thursday's news

Texto completo: One of the greatest runs in horse racing history may have been tainted, and the Coast Guard warns against unsupervised phone charging. Plus: Dogs of The Short List.
It's Ashley. Let's dive into today's news, shall we?
But first, cue the "Rocky" theme song: Here are five questions tonight's Democratic debate may answer, including: Is Joe Biden a fragile front-runner?
Was this horse on drugs?
Triple Crown-winning thoroughbred Justify failed a drug test in the weeks leading up to the 2018 Kentucky Derby, according to a report from The New York Times, but the horse was still allowed to race in all three events, winning the Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes en route to the crown jewel of horse racing. The California Horse Racing Board took months to confirm the results of the test and made several decisions (in secret, apparently!) to drop the case and soften the penalty for any horse with the substance scopolamine, which was found in Justify's system, according to the story.
The cover-up for Triple Crown winner Justify looks shameful, Tim Sullivan says, no matter how it's framed.
Beware of charging phones, Coast Guard warns
The Coast Guard has a warning for boat operators: Keep an eye on charging phones. After the California boat fire that killed 34 people on Labor Day, the Coast Guard issued a safety bulletin recommending commercial boat operators limit unsupervised charging of cellphones and other electronic devices. Boat operators should "consider limiting the unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and extensive use of power strips and extension cords," the bulletin said. The batteries, found in millions of electronic devices, are filled with volatile, flammable chemicals. Incidents of battery fires are extremely rare. Though we still don’t know what caused the boat fire, the National Transportation Safety Board said the way batteries and electronics were stored and charged is being scrutinized.
The law that could make a difference: Charges in California boat fire may hinge on 1838 law.
What everyone’s talking about

15,000 people in the Bahamas are without food or shelter
More than a week after Hurricane Dorian devastated the Bahamas, thousands of people are without shelter and food, 1,300 are missing, and the prime minister says he expects the death toll of 50 to "significantly increase. " To help aid the country as it tries to emerge from the devastating storm, golfer Tiger Woods and singer Justin Timberlake established the One Bahamas Fund, aimed at providing shelter, food, clothing and infrastructure needs to the islands. "It's horrifying to see the videos and hear the stories about the effects of Hurricane Dorian," said Woods, who called the need in the Bahamas "very real. " According to the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, about 15,000 people need shelter or food.
Tropical Storm Humberto is likely to form by this weekend near the Bahamas and could head toward Florida.
Former FBI second-in-command is in the hot seat
Federal prosecutors recommended that Andrew McCabe be indicted. McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI and a frequent target of criticism by President Donald Trump, faced scrutiny in his role regarding a leak about an investigation of the Clinton Foundation shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors in Washington recommended that he be indicted, and a top Justice Department official told his lawyers Thursday that the case could proceed, a person familiar with the matter said. McCabe's lawyers asked the Justice Department to overrule the indictment recommendation, but the department refused, clearing the way for a criminal charge.
Real quick
An arrest warrant was issued for R. Kelly after he failed to appear in court to face sex-crime charges.
Odell Beckham Jr. was called out by Warren Sapp for wearing a $350,000 watch.
Terri Lynn Hollis, 11, was murdered on Thanksgiving Day 1972. Investigators have finally solved her murder.

One of the country’s most wanted fugitives was arrested after a weeks-long manhunt.
The murder of 9-year-old Tyshawn Lee horrified Chicago. Now, gang members will stand trial.
Remember when y'all sent in pictures of your dogs?
First of all: That was the best day of my life. Second: Thank you, your pups are majestic creatures. But we didn't think including your dogs in The Short List newsletter was quite enough to showcase their furry glory, so we've published a gallery of some of your pooches to USA TODAY. Are you ready for this? Check out some of the adorable "Dogs of The Short List. " Oh, and check out our Instagram Story today, too.
Share the gallery with your friends, share it with your enemies, but be sure to tell them to sign up for "The Short List" newsletter!

Trump lost his marbles long ago

Autor: Boot, Max.

Texto completo: P resident Trump spent much of last week obsessed with proving that he was right to claim on Sept. 1 that Alabama "will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated" by Hurricane Dorian - a claim immediately (and accurately) contradicted by the National Weather Service office in Birmingham. A normal president would have simply said, "I hadn't realized that the hurricane projections had changed by the time I spoke," and moved on to more important matters of state. Not Trump. He has devoted 12 tweets - and counting - to insist that his false information was factual. He even held up a weather map clumsily altered with a Sharpie to claim vindication.
Coming after a report that Trump was interested in nuking hurricanes, Sharpiegate has contributed to concerns that the most powerful man in the world is losing his marbles. Business Insider quotes "one former White House official" saying, "No one knows what to expect from him anymore . . . He's losing his s---" and a "Republican strategist who's in frequent contact with the White House" saying: "He's deteriorating in plain sight." Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci says, "The guy is obviously in mental decline."
I agree with former Republican White House aide Peter Wehner, who argues in the Atlantic that "Trump's disordered personality - his unhealthy patterns of thinking, functioning, and behaving - has become the defining characteristic of his presidency." But I disagree with those who insist that Trump is getting worse. Maybe he is, but those who say this conveniently forget how bad he was from the very beginning.
This was, after all, a president who suggested that Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States, that Ted Cruz's father was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination, that global warming was a Chinese hoax, that wind farms cause cancer and that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered. Trump lied about the size of his inauguration crowds, claimed that Obama had wiretapped him and insisted that he was the victim of a Deep State conspiracy.
Those are not the actions of a normal person - and none of them happened recently. Some Republicans might be ignoring this history of alarming behavior to absolve themselves of responsibility for enabling a president who was so obviously unfit from the start.
So if Trump isn't getting worse mentally, what's going on? My theory is that there are fewer checks on him today than there were at the start. Jim Mattis, John F. Kelly, H.R. McMaster, Nikki Haley, Rex Tillerson and other officials - even John Bolton - were occasionally successful in checking Trump's erratic impulses. But the adults are gone, and their replacements are mainly sycophants and timeservers who are happy to tell Trump that 2+2=22.
Case in point: Trump's bizarre decision to invite the Taliban to Camp David on the eve of the 9/11 anniversary. Then-national security adviser Bolton reportedly criticized this move (along with the general direction of Afghan negotiations), leading to a final break with Trump. Yet even as Bolton was leaving, Trump abruptly withdrew the invitation to Camp David and announced that talks with the Taliban were "dead." Vice President Pence rushed to deny that he had had any disagreement with the president ("More Fake News!") and told Trump on Twitter "I FULLY support your decision." But which decision? Was Pence saying he supported both the invitation to the Taliban and the withdrawal of the invitation? It takes superhuman levels of sycophancy to always agree with a president who is constantly changing his mind.
What is truly ominous is that we have moved beyond administration officials simply affirming whatever Trump says. Some are now trying to twist the facts to conform with Trump's twisted worldview. The New York Times reports that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross threatened to fire top officials after the National Weather Service dared to contradict Trump's claim that a hurricane was heading for Alabama, and that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, told Ross to have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration disavow its own forecasters. NOAA then did just that. (The Post reports Mulvaney was responding to pressure from Trump.) The word "Orwellian" has gotten a lot of mileage lately. But if this isn't Orwellian, it's hard to know what is.
As lawyer George T. Conway III (who is married to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway) tweeted: "What's next? Will the National Air and Space Museum construct exhibits on the significance of military aviation during the Revolutionary War?" This was, of course, a reference to Trump's Fourth of July ad-lib, when he said that "our army . . . took over the airports" during the War of Independence. This imaginative rewrite of history might itself be taken as evidence that the president's mental faculties are in decline - were it not for the fact that all the way back in 2016 Trump engaged in another bit of historical revisionism by claiming that Obama founded the Islamic State.
The evidence suggests that Trump hasn't gone off his rocker lately - because he was never on it to begin with. That's an uncomfortable thing to say about a president of the United States, but we can't ignore reality because it's so alarming. Trump's supporters ill serve the country - or a president in obvious need of help - by pretending that everything is normal when it so obviously isn't.

Texto completo: Liberals of a certain age, upon hearing the name “Molly Ivins,” will find themselves smiling.
If you’re smiling, plan to see “Raise Hell: The Life & Times of Molly Ivins,” a documentary celebrating her life, which opens at the Lagoon Cinema in Minneapolis on Friday.
Ivins was a loud, hilarious, 6-foot-tall progressive journalist from Texas. Although she worked as a young reporter, she is best known for her decades as a crusading columnist, gifted at mocking both convention and conservatism.
(Local angle: On her way to national fame, Ivins worked as a reporter for the Houston Chronicle, the Texas Observer and the Minneapolis Tribune. If any old Stribbers are reading this, Marilyn Hoegemeyer testifies in the film about Ivins’ Minneapolis period. And, according to the film, reporter Ivins was so hard on the local cops that the Minneapolis Police had a pet pig that they named “Molly.”)
Ivins left us for the New York Times in the early ’70s, and I arrived after that, so I never knew her, but I wish I had.
Ivins was a hilariously poor fit for the staid “grey lady,” as the Times is nicknamed. She constantly scandalized the high-toned editor, Abe Rosenthal, and could not reconcile herself to the conventions of so-called objective journalism. (It was her position that the term “objective journalism” is nonsense. The film includes some great anecdotes from her New York Times period.)
Back in Texas, where she belonged, Ivins wrote a column, which was syndicated nationally, from a base at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. That was the work that turned her into a national liberal icon. She had a particular knack for mocking George W. Bush (she is credited with nicknaming him “Shrub,” and the nickname stuck). This caused some of the conservative Texas papers to buy the exclusive right to her column in their market but never run them, which precluded other papers from publishing them in the same market.
Before I get too far from Ivins’ Minnesota period, I should pass along a famous remark, quoted in the film, which alludes to a famous Minnesotan, in contrast to herself, to describe the “two kinds of humor:”
“There are two kinds of humor. One kind that makes us chuckle about our foibles and our shared humanity — like what Garrison Keillor does. The other kind holds people up to public contempt and ridicule — that’s what I do. Satire is traditionally the weapon of the powerless against the powerful. I only aim at the powerful. When satire is aimed at the powerless, it is not only cruel — it’s vulgar.”
Ivins died at age 62 of cancer in 2007. And I hadn’t thought much about her recently, so I was delighted to be reminded of her life and work when I got to watch a preview showing of the film. (What a gig I have!) Being a liberal of a certain age, it made me smile.
Among those who admired her and are on camera in the film are Dan Rather, Rachel Maddow, and former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, with whom she was good buddies.
Ivins was so foul-mouthed, she named her dog “Shit.” As long as I’ve used that word, I’ll double down with one more quote that I managed to scribble in my notebook in the dark as I watched the preview. It seems to have captured her worldview: “We live in a world where shit flows downhill and the people at the bottom are drowning in it.”
And, without benefit of a curse, there’s this quote on her philosophy of writing about politics:
“I figure there’s only three possible reactions to most of politics — you can laugh, you can cry, or you can throw up. You might as well laugh. It’s a better way to live life.”
I guess you have the same three options watching the story of Ivins’ sad, funny, short life. In her honor, I laughed.
(I was taking notes in a dark theater, so forgive me if any of the quotes or details are a little off.)
The film opens Friday at the Lagoon.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee joined the Congressional Black Caucus in commemorating the 400th anniversary of the arrival of enslaved Africans to America on Tuesday.
On Monday, Lee also led a special order hour on the House Floor during which CBC members joined her in delivering remarks acknowledging this dark moment in American history. Lee reflected on the impact of the slave trade on Africans and African Americans, drew connections between the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow in the U.S. and systemic inequalities impacting African Americans today, celebrated the contributions of African Americans to the nation, and noted her recent trip to Ghana with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and members of the CBC.
"Four hundred years ago, as we've heard tonight, the first slave ship arrived in Virginia. This began one of the darkest chapters in American history," said Lee. "During the course of over 250 years of slavery in America - that's government-sanctioned slavery in America - families were ripped apart. People were beaten and brutalized. Men, women, and children were sold and traded like objects. And to this day, Black communities continue to suffer from the generational trauma from these crimes against humanity."
"So today, as we observe 400 years since the first enslaved Africans were brought to these shores, let it be known that this is a Sankofa moment," continued Lee, referencing a West African symbol for the need to learn from the past in order to move forward. "Moving forward, I look forward to this body addressing the damage caused by the inhumanity of slavery by advancing positive legislation that uplifts the descendants of those who were enslaved, including H.R.40."
HR 40 is the call for reparations for descendants of people who were enslaved in the U.S.
At the conclusion of her remarks, Lee asked for unanimous consent to enter The New York Times' seminal project on the legacy of slavery in the United States, the 1619 Project, into the Congressional record. The project seeks to reframe readers' understanding of the role of slavery as America's foundational institution and its legacy and impact throughout the nation's history.

Kamala Harris’ criminal justice reform plan can’t be trusted

Texto completo: “I know the system from the inside out, so trust me when I say we have a problem with mass incarceration in America. Trust me when I say we have a problem with accountability. Trust me when I say we have to take the profit out of criminal justice.” These are the words of presidential candidate Kamala Harris in an interview with the New York Times on her recently-unveiled criminal justice plan. She asks voters to put their faith in her because of her experience, but it’s her experience that shows voters exactly why they should think twice about that.
Harris’s new plan begins with an introduction that attempts once more to paint the self-portrait she’s persistently pushed throughout her campaign: one of a reform-minded prosecutor who “has seen firsthand the fundamental flaws of the system.” She’s seen them alright—and personally contributed to them. As Tulsi Gabbard aptly noted in the last debate, Harris was far from a reformer during her prosecutor days. In fact, she was notoriously tough on crime.
But she’s apparently had a pretty recent change of heart.
In her new plan, Harris proposes ending the war on drugs, claiming marijuana legalization is the first step toward that. It’s an excellent proposition and fairly mainstream among the Democratic candidates, but it’s certainly not something that Harris has always stood by.
Historically, she opposed the legalization of marijuana, and as a San Francisco District Attorney, she oversaw hundreds of marijuana convictions. Although she may not have been directly involved in the convictions, she had immense power to direct her attorneys which marijuana cases to prosecute, and what punishments to pursue. Yet, despite how sorry she is for all of the lives she’s had a part in ruining during her tenure as lead prosecutor, she’s done nothing to help those particular people.
Among her plans, too, we find a proposed effort to expunge marijuana-related criminal records and create a grant program from marijuana sales tax to help those most adversely affected by the drug war. Sure, these policies are noble, but they’re not a total ceasefire in the drug war by any means. After all, this is where Harris’s plan here falls flat. Aside from legalizing marijuana, she supports reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. That’s a change that is certainly important, but, in terms of drug reform, it’s low-hanging fruit.
Proposing pre- arrest diversion programs, legalizing safe injection sites, descheduling drugs and loosening academic study restrictions are all strong policies that would help end the drug war. But she didn’t make any of those suggestions.
As a San Francisco District Attorney, Harris opposed the use of drug courts for those charged with drug related crimes—another action which is not cohesive with ending the drug war which she now supports. Drug courts are great, because they’re set up to provide an alternative sentencing route for individuals so they can be connected with the resources and treatment they need, rather than sticking them straight into prison.
But as Reason Magazine reports, Harris complained that people “learned how to manipulate the system by simply claiming to be addicts.” She proposed barring individuals from drug court if they had ever sold any quantity of drugs in the past—even if they needed addiction help. This means prison time for low-level drug offenders who, somehow, she’s had a wild change of mind about.
That same goes for her stance of the cash bail system. Money bail disproportionately harms low- income individuals, because they can’t afford to buy their way out of pretrial incarceration the way the wealthy can. They remain in jail—sometimes for months on end—until they can find a way to post bail or until their court date comes around.
Though Harris has sponsored legislation to end cash bail, this fight may dwindle when she becomes president. She previously supported hiking the rates of cash bail, but, of course, this is the exact opposite of what she’s saying now.
Sure, Harris’s criminal justice plan has a lot of good proposals. It even calls for accountability by granting the U.S. Department of Justice explicit authority to conduct investigations into prosecutorial offices that commit misconduct.
It’s a bold policy that stands among many other needed reforms outlined found in her plan. But none of this changes the fact that she spent so many years of her life locking people up for the things she’s claiming to be dovish on now. And that’s when she wasn’t trying to become president.
Harris has been caught lying for political gain before, so what’s stopping her from doing it again—especially if it could win her the Oval Office?
For the sake of those who spent years of their lives sitting in prisons because of her terrible policies, it’s a question worth seriously considering.

Leonard Pitts: Another mass shooting, a nation on tenterhooks

Texto completo: In 1879, on the road leading into Dodge City, there stood a sign. "The Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited," it said.
As recounted in the book “Gunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America” by Adam Winkler, the gun control ordinance was the first law passed when the city was organized in 1873. Nor was Dodge unique. Many other western towns, Wichita and Tombstone among them, had similar laws.
The statutes don't seem to have been particularly controversial. Though Dodge City was, by reputation if not always in actual fact, one of the toughest and most lawless places on the frontier, cowboys had no problem walking unarmed into its brothels and saloons. Yet in 2019, many of us feel the need to take guns into Walmart.
Worse, they're allowed to do so under permissive "open carry" laws which, in most states, give people the right to bear handguns and even long guns in public. But now Walmart is fighting back. Sort of.
Last week, the giant retailer announced that it was “respectfully requesting” that people not bring guns into its stores. This, on the heels of last month’s racist mass shooting — 22 people died — at a Walmart in El Paso. Other companies, including Kroger, CVS and Walgreens, quickly followed suit. The New York Times notes that still more companies — Starbucks, Target and Chipotle among them — already had such policies in place. Most used the same word Walmart did to couch their requests: “respectfully.”
To say "it's about time" is to understate. Years of living in the shadow of massacres has left us a nation on tenterhooks, 330 million people all sharing the same case of PTSD. One recalls the panicked stampede in Times Square last month when motorcycles backfired. One observes that children are being sent back to school this year with bulletproof backpacks. And one is glad businesses are willing to "respectfully request."
But they must do more.
The idea of a cowboy walking without his revolver down the wooden sidewalks of Tombstone stands in rather pointed contrast to that of some accountant waiting in line at a suburban Starbucks with an AR-15 slung across his back. One can imagine no more vivid illustration of the absurdist dystopia this country has become as a result of the NRA, its GOP toadies and their conviction that all people must have access to all guns in all places at all times.
If you're sitting in a movie theater or standing in a checkout line and some stranger walks by carrying a military grade rifle, do you feel safer or do you start looking for the exit? The answer is obvious: this is not a scenario that instills a sense of security. One would have to be drunk, stupid or Republican to think otherwise.
So it's good to see American business taking a stand American lawmakers won't, the marketplace of commerce reaching a consensus the marketplace of ideas can't. That said, this polite pleading is not enough. Asked about Walmart's policy, even David Amad, a gun rights activist in Texas, told the Times, "They are ducking the issue."
Which they are. Walmart and other retailers seek a path of least resistance that will relieve them of the responsibility of taking a stand. But no such path exists: sides must be chosen and lines must be drawn, because this is, quite literally, a matter of life and death. And death and death and death. As a private entity, Walmart, like CVS, Starbucks and Kroger, can simply say, Do not bring guns into our stores. They have that power and they must use it. The majority of us who want gun sanity in this land must require them to. They've made their "respectful request."
We must answer with an impatient demand.

For A Longer Life, Get Moving, Even A Little Bit

Texto completo: Men and women who move around throughout the day, even if they just stroll or clean the kitchen and do not formally exercise, are less likely to die prematurely than people who hardly ever leave their chairs, according to a new study of physical activity and mortality.
The study, the largest of its kind to date, finds that any activity, no matter how modest, can reduce mortality risks, with some of the greatest gains seen when people shift from being almost completely sedentary toward rising and ambling for even an extra hour each day.
By now, none of us should be surprised to hear that exercise and movement are good for us. Many studies show links between activity and longevity, with more moving almost always tied to longer life spans.
A limitation of these past studies, however, is that in many of them, researchers asked people how active they had been in recent days or weeks, and most of us cannot accurately report how much time we spent sitting or completing gentle, everyday activities like cooking and cleaning.
Some of those past studies, however, did equip people with activity trackers to objectively monitor their days. But most of those have tended to be small or focused only on men, women or older adults, making their results difficult to interpret for the general population.
So for the new study, published in August in the British Medical Journal, an international consortium of researchers combined and reanalyzed data from earlier studies that had provided volunteers with activity monitors. They wound up with data covering 36,383 middle-age or older men and women and divided them according to levels of activity. They found, to no one’s surprise, that the men and women who were the most active were the least likely to have died. That group’s risk of premature death was about 60% lower than for the men and women in the most-sedentary group.
More unexpected, people in the second-least-active group also were significantly less likely to have died than those in the least-active group, even though their activities consisted primarily of moseying, housecleaning, cooking or gardening.
Overall, the researchers found, someone’s chances of dying prematurely continued to drop the more he or she moved, up to a plateau at about 25 minutes per day of moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, or 300 minutes a day of light, gentle activity. Beyond that point, people did not gain additional longevity benefits, although their risks of premature death did not rise either.

Texto completo: For Chris Cohen and his wife, Christine, the new owners of Sidecar Treats in Cape Coral, moving to Southwest Florida and owning an ice cream shop came from one stroke of luck after the other.
Earlier this year, the pair were living on Long Island, going about their normal routine. Christine worked for the customer service branch of the IRS. She thought she'd put in a transfer to move to the Southwest Florida office. Chris' father was in a nursing home in Fort Myers. It was an area the couple knew well.
They didn't hold their breath on the transfer.
Requests to move from northern branches to offices in southern states can take five to seven years, depending on availability, Chris explained. And the branch where Christine worked on Long Island had about 6,000 people, while the Southwest Florida branch would be much, much smaller. As Chris put it, getting the transfer would be like hitting the lottery.
Yet two weeks after Christine put in her transfer request, that's exactly what happened. Suddenly, the Cohens were moving to the Sunshine State.
Chris needed a project.
Soon after Christine got the news, Chris was "loafing around on Craigslist," as he put it. He discovered the Cape Coral location of Sidecar Treats for sale. Sidecar has a store in downtown Fort Myers stocked with gourmet popcorn, candy and ice cream. The owners had launched a second one in Cape Coral, but decided to focus their energies on the Fort Myers store instead. It was another stroke of luck for Chris, who was no stranger to the ice cream business.
"I used to be a distribution manager for Hershey ice cream," he said.
"Although I never scooped ice cream, I managed service calls and sent trucks out to mom and pops."
So, while Christine finished out her work in the Long Island IRS office, Chris flew to Florida shortly after Memorial Day to set up their new life. They'd bought a condo sight-unseen. Chris had to hire contractors, pick out floor tiles and choose paint colors while Christine managed the sale of their Long Island house.
"My wife's seen photos," Chris said of the work on the condo. "And thus far, thumbs-up on everything."
At Sidecar Treats in Cape Coral, everything was ready to go — ice cream ordered, popcorn in stock, shelves stacked with candy.
"I just had to set up a register system, and away we went," he said.
The business launched at the beginning of July, and Chris has seen a steady stream of traffic ever since. The shop carries Love Boat Ice Cream, from the standard flavors to the wilder varieties, with brownie batter and chocolate peanut butter being the most popular at the Cape shop. The store is also dog friendly, and every dog gets a treat.
The couple have had a lot of luck, and they're happy to spread it around.
"We want it to be a destination for moms, dads, kids — everybody," Chris said.
"We're trying to make it part of the community."

Texto completo: Conservative reaction to The New York Times’ "1619 Project" — an attempt to tell the story of slavery and its lasting effect on American political, economic and social structures — has been both disappointing and instructive.
I am not referring here to thinkers (the term is employed loosely) who consciously embrace a philosophy of white supremacy. Though resurgent and repellent, they do not constitute the mainstream of conservative thinking on race.
I am thinking instead of conservative writers who argue that the 1619 Project is a prime example of leftist ideological overreach — that its (mainly African American) authors see the country entirely through the prism of its sins and intend to "delegitimize" the American experiment. In making this case, some conservatives have offered excuses — or at least mitigations — for the moral failures of the founders on matters of race.
The institution of slavery, we are assured, was historically ubiquitous. The global slave trade, we are reminded, involved not just Americans but Arabs and black Africans. Other countries, we are told, took more slaves than America, treated them worse and liberated them later. The attempt here is to defend the honor of the American experiment by denying the uniqueness of its hypocrisy on slavery. In one way or another, all these arguments ask us to consider the inadequacies of the founders within the context of their times.
But to deny the uniqueness of American guilt on slavery is also to deny the uniqueness of its aspirations. Americans are required to have ambiguous feelings about many of the country’s founders precisely because of the moral ideals the founders engraved in American life. The height of their ambitions is also the measure of their hypocrisy. It should unsettle us that the author of the Declaration of Independence built a way of life entirely dependent on human bondage.
This leads to an unavoidably complex form of patriotism. We properly venerate not the founders, but the standards they raised and often failed to meet. This is their primary achievement: They put into place an ideological structure that harshly judged their own practice and drove American democracy to achievements beyond the limits of their vision.
In the mid to late 18th century, there was plenty of compelling moral thinking on the issue of slavery.
In 1759, Quaker Anthony Benezet wrote "Observations on the Enslaving, Importing and Purchasing of Negroes," which presented eyewitness accounts of the cruelties of the slave trade. Benezet called slavery "inconsistent with the gospel of Christ, contrary to natural justice and the common feelings of humanity, and productive of infinite calamities to many thousand families, nay to many nations, and consequently offensive to God the father of all mankind."
In 1776, the year independence was declared, Presbyterian pastor Samuel Hopkins wrote "A Dialogue Concerning the Slavery of the Africans," which he dedicated to the Continental Congress. Hopkins urged his readers to "behold the sons of liberty oppressing and tyrannizing over many thousands of poor blacks who have as good a claim to liberty as themselves."
In 1778, another minister, Jacob Green, pointed out the discrediting inconsistency of a country that was dedicated to liberty and yet tolerant of slavery: "What foreign nation can believe that we who so loudly complain of Britain’s attempts to oppress and enslave us, are, at the same time, voluntarily holding multitudes of fellow creatures in abject slavery…?"
America’s founders stand accused by the best, most humane standards of their own time. When Jefferson wrote about natural rights on his mountaintop prison for black people, many of his contemporaries knew he was, on this issue, a total hypocrite.
America’s story is not one of initial purity and eventual decay. It is the story of a radical principle — the principle of human equality — introduced into a deeply unjust society. That principle was carried forward by oppressed people who understood it better than many of the nation’s founders. Denied the blessings of liberty, African Americans became the instruments by which the promise of liberty was broadly achieved. The victims of America’s moral blindness became carriers of the American ideal.
This story is not simple to tell. But it is miraculous in its own way. And it is good reason to be proud of America.

Texto completo: Robert Frank, the fiercely independent photographer and filmmaker whose bleak yet poetic book "The Americans" jolted the nation's self-image and sparked a photographic revolution, has died. He was 94.
In his life and art, the Swiss-born Frank followed his twin muses - intuition and imagination - wherever they led. During a career that spanned nearly seven decades, he shifted from still to moving pictures and back again, sometimes blurring the lines between the two as he experimented with content and form.
His death was confirmed by the Pace-MacGill Gallery in Manhattan, the New York Times reported.
"The Americans," which was first published in the late 1950s, is considered one of the most influential photography books of the 20th century. Its 83 black-and-white images - largely taken during a series of road trips - made the ordinary seem extraordinary and established what the noted curator John Szarkowski called "a new iconography for contemporary America, comprised of bits of bus depots, lunch counters, strip developments, empty spaces, cars, and unknowable faces."
Initially derided by many critics, the book "came to be passionately embraced by younger photographers and artists, and then by the public, for its radically innovative subject matter and style," said Sarah Greenough, senior curator and head of the department of photographs at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, which has mounted two Frank exhibitions and is home to a major archive of his work.
In the '50s, the nation liked to think of itself as being as prosperous and wholesome as the picket-fenced suburbia of television shows like "Father Knows Best." Frank presented a more diverse - and disquieting - view. His book looked "beneath the surface of America," Greenough told The Times, "revealing issues like racism, skepticism of political leaders and a rapidly rising consumer culture that are still relevant."
The immigrant photographer had set out to produce, as he put it, "a spontaneous record of a man seeing this country for the first time." Starting in the East, he and his Leica camera captured people of different races and classes living their lives, from Southern hamlets to Midwestern metropolises to western highways. Observing what others often overlooked, he exposed undercurrents of isolation and angst, discovered beauty in unexpected places and turned mundane scenes - a passing trolley, an elevator ride - into telling portraits of postwar society.
Compared to classic compositions of the day, Frank's pictures looked rough, as if done on the fly, poorly lighted and oddly framed. But to admirers, such imperfections made the images feel more "true," while prompting viewers to ponder their deeper meaning.
Frank's first film, "Pull My Daisy," a 1959 Beat tale he co-directed with Alfred Leslie, is regarded as an important example of American avant-garde cinema. Many of his other works were intensely personal. "I think I became more occupied with my own life, with my own situation, instead of traveling and looking at the cities and landscape," he said in the 1986 documentary "Fire in the East: A Portrait of Robert Frank." "And I think that brought me to move away from the single image, and begin to film, where I had to tell a story."
Robert Louis Frank was born in Zurich, Switzerland, on Nov. 9, 1924. He was the younger of two sons of Hermann, a successful businessman, and Regina, the daughter of a wealthy factory owner.
Everyone expected Frank to go into business, too. He had other ideas. In his teens, he became a photographer's apprentice and worked in several studios, learning about graphics and publishing as well as photography.
During World War II, the Franks, who were Jewish, maintained a safe, if uneasy, existence in neutral Switzerland. After the war, the restless young man decided to leave a homeland he found small and confining. In 1947 he arrived in New York, a city alive with poets, painters and jazz musicians as well as magazines that championed photography as journalism and art. Frank was hired by Alexey Brodovitch, the celebrated art director of Harper's Bazaar, and spent a short stint on the Bazaar staff before striking out on his own. He traveled extensively in Latin America and Europe, shooting evocative images of people and places that caught his eye.
Frank married artist Mary Lockspeiser in 1950. That same year, he was chosen for a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Edward Steichen, Szarkowski's predecessor as director of the museum's photography department, was an early admirer.
Another supporter was photographer Walker Evans, a mentor who helped win the Guggenheim fellowship money that financed the trips for "The Americans."
In 1955 and 1956, Frank drove a used Ford up, down and across the nation. He filled more than 760 rolls of film. "It was hard work," said Greenough, "and he was frequently harassed because he was a stranger taking pictures in places where strangers weren't always welcome."
Back in New York, Frank reviewed thousands of frames and then sequenced his selections, creating what he called a "distinct and intense order" that enhanced their dramatic and thematic impact.
"Les AmÃ©ricains" was first published in France in 1958 by Frank's friend Robert Delpire. A year later, Grove Press came out with "The Americans," a U.S. edition that had an introduction by Jack Kerouac. "Robert Frank, Swiss, unobtrusive, nice, with that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film," Kerouac wrote, "taking rank among the tragic poets of the world."
Reviewers were less enthusiastic. While some sounded positive notes, many - especially those from photography magazines - lambasted Frank, accusing him of being misguided, mean-spirited and - perhaps worst of all, given the Cold War climate - anti-American. Popular Photography decried his prints as "flawed by meaningless blur, grain, muddy exposure, drunken horizons and general sloppiness."
"I do like America," Frank said in a 2004 documentary, noting that "I became an American." (He gained U.S. citizenship in 1963.) His project made him realize how "lonely" and "tough" the country could be, he recalled in "Leaving Home, Coming Home: A Portrait of Robert Frank." "Also, I saw for the first time the way blacks were treated. It was surprising to me. But it didn't make me hate America. It made me understand how people can be."
As times changed so did perceptions of Frank. By the end of the 1960s, he was being hailed as a prescient social observer and convention-busting artist who changed the course of modern photography.
"Seeing 'The Americans' in a college bookshop was a stunning, ground-trembling experience for me," artist Ed Ruscha told Tate Etc., the international art magazine, in 2004.
"Frank creates movement with his camera and his subject in a truly original way," photographer Mary Ellen Mark said in the same issue. "He's a narrative photographer. Looking at his pictures is like watching a part of film; you can imagine what is happening around the frame."
Rather than embrace fame, the at-times-reclusive Frank often seemed to do what he could to avoid it. For a while, he thought of "The Americans" as an albatross. "He felt like a rock star expected to sing a certain song," Greenough said. Eventually, he came to appreciate the book but, loath to repeat himself, he remained eager to try new things.
Indeed, after "The Americans," Frank turned his attention to dramatic and documentary films and videos. Among the best-known is his controversial look at the Rolling Stones' 1972 North American tour. The Stones fought to prevent release of the movie with the unprintable title; Frank won the right to screen it under restricted conditions.
In 1972, Frank published the autobiographical photography book "The Lines of My Hand." He began to create Polaroid art, collages and images constructed, altered and scribbled on.
Robert and Mary Frank separated in 1969. Their daughter, Andrea, died in a plane crash in 1974. Frank expressed his grief in the 1980 film "Life Dances On...." In the 2004 "True Story," he included scenes from his life and work and correspondence from his son, Pablo, who died in 1994 after a battle with mental illness.
Frank married artist June Leaf in 1975. For decades the couple lived in tiny Mabou, Nova Scotia, and New York.
In 2009, radio interviewer Bob Edwards asked Frank what tips he had for young photographers. "I'm not too much about talking or giving advice," he said. " 'Keep your eyes open' ... that's what I tell them."

Antonio Brown accused of rape in a lawsuit

Texto completo: Just a day after formally signing with the Patriots, the controversial and gifted receiver Antonio Brown was accused of raping his former trainer, who said in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday that he sexually assaulted her three times in the past two years.
The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, alleges Brown sexually assaulted Britney Taylor, a gymnast he met while they were attending Central Michigan University together. Brown later hired Taylor as a trainer.
In her lawsuit, Taylor alleges that Brown sexually assaulted her twice during training sessions in June 2017.
Then, the lawsuit says, on May 20, 2018, Brown forced her onto a bed, pushed her face into the mattress, and raped her. She tried to resist him, screaming and repeatedly shouting “no" and “stop," the lawsuit says, but Brown refused.
Brown's legal team released a statement denying the allegations.
“Mr. Brown denies each and every allegation in the lawsuit," read the statement from Darren Heitner, a lawyer representing Brown. “He will pursue all legal remedies to not only clear his name, but to also protect other professional athletes against false accusations."
The lawsuit adds to the legacy of Brown, who has had multiple run-ins with the law over the last few years and who was released by the Oakland Raiders after a brief, bizarre tenure.
In April 2018, while a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown was allegedly involved in an incident where he tossed furniture from the balcony of a 14-story apartment building in Florida, and was later part of a suit brought by the grandfather of a young child who was reportedly almost struck by the furniture. (That suit was settled by the two parties.) In January 2019, he was involved in a domestic disturbance in Hollywood, Fla., but wasn't arrested.
More recently, in Oakland, his list of transgressions included a social media movie narrated by a private phone conversation with his coach, a reported on-field altercation with his general manager, and another social media post that featured a photo of private, internal correspondence from his team.
Warning: Some content and language in this lawsuit is graphic
The Patriots released a statement Tuesday night saying, “We are aware of the civil lawsuit that was filed today against Antonio Brown, as well as the response by Antonio's representatives. We take these allegations very seriously. Under no circumstance does this organization condone sexual violence or assault. The league has informed us that they will be investigating. We will have no further comment while that investigation takes place."
In a statement released to The New York Times by her lawyer, Taylor said the decision to come forward was a challenge.
“As a rape victim of Antonio Brown, deciding to speak out has been an incredibly difficult decision," she said. “I have found strength in my faith, my family, and from the accounts of other survivors of sexual assault."
According to the lawsuit, the two met in college as part of a Bible study group and became friends. They went their separate ways, it alleges, before they connected again in June 2017. Shortly after that, Brown hired Taylor as part of his physical training team.
In the suit, Taylor says she “never dated or had an interest in any romantic relationship with Brown." The suit describes her as an elite-level gymnast who opened a gymnastics training center for girls in her hometown of Memphis.
“Brown preyed on Ms. Taylor's kindness and her religious devotion, casting himself as a person equally dedicated to his religious faith and someone she could trust. In reality, he used manipulation and false promises to lure her into his world, and once there, he sexually assaulted and raped her," the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit says Brown bragged about the incident in text messages that are copied in the lawsuit.
There is no mention of criminal charges or a police investigation into the allegations in the lawsuit.
Heitner, Brown's lawyer, said that Brown was approached by his accuser in 2017 and asked to invest $1.6 million in her business project.
“Mr. Brown was not informed by his accuser that she had just been levied with a $30,000 IRS tax lien or that $300,000 of the $1.6 million so-called 'investment' was to be used to purchase property already owned by the accuser and her mother," Brown's lawyer said. “When Mr. Brown refused to make the $1.6 million 'investment,' the accuser supposedly cut off communications with Mr. Brown."
However, Heitner said, she “resurfaced" in 2018 and offered to train Brown for the upcoming season.
“Thereafter, the accuser engaged Mr. Brown in a consensual personal relationship. Any sexual interaction with Mr. Brown was entirely consensual," Heitner said in a statement.
Brown is scheduled to attend Patriots practice on Wednesday.
According to an NFL Media report, Brown's deal includes a $1 million fully guaranteed base, a $9 million signing bonus ($5 million immediately, $4 million later), and other incentives.
Brown had 104 catches, 1,297 yards, and a league-high 15 receiving touchdowns last season. He is a four-time first-team All-Pro.
For the Patriots, the lawsuit will force the team to confront a decision of how to handle the allegations.
When New England acquired defensive lineman Albert Haynesworth in the summer of 2011, he was facing a sexual assault charge following an alleged incident that February. Haynesworth later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor assault charge, and played a portion of that season before he was released by the team.

Texto completo: Robert Frank, whose 1958 book, “The Americans," changed the face of 20th-century photography, died Monday in Nova Scotia. He was 94. The cause of death was not immediately known.
As the novelist Jack Kerouac wrote in his introduction to “The Americans," “Robert Frank, Swiss, unobtrusive, nice, with that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand . . . sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film, taking rank among the tragic poets of the world."
What Mr. Frank did in that book was to take the leading tradition of American photography — the documentary tradition, with its reverence for the particular, of Timothy O'Sullivan, Lewis Hine, and Walker Evans — and enlarge it: to emblematize the particular and make it mythic.
As Mr. Frank wrote in his application for the Guggenheim Fellowship that underwrote the photographic travels that resulted in “The Americans," “ 'The photographing of America' is a large order — read at all literally, the phrase would be an absurdity. What I have in mind, then, is observation and record of what one naturalized American finds to see in the United States that signifies the kind of civilization born here and spreading elsewhere."
In the end, the book's 83 images are about nothing so much as American immensity, a span of distance both inner and outer. So many of the people pictured in the book stare off elsewhere. Rarely do they look at one another, and almost never into the camera. For all that the book's title suggests otherwise, “The Americans" is not about people. It's about the space that holds them.
“In this picture," Evans wrote of an image of an empty highway, "US 285, New Mexico," "you instantly find the continent. The whole page is haunted with American scale and space, which the mind fills in quite automatically . . ."
Five days after Mr. Frank arrived in the United States, in 1947, he wrote home, “Nothing is impossible here. They have electric toothbrushes and nail clippers. . . . In 10 minutes you have eaten and there are three men standing behind you, waiting for you to leave . . . I can only tell you this; you have to see for yourself." That sense of discovery informs every image in “The Americans," as Mr. Frank's camera reveals a land of highways and jukeboxes, unwatched televisions and waving flags, mink stoles and movie premieres.
With his cool, disarmingly hungry eye, Mr. Frank gathered up America in a casual embrace. Affecting neither advocacy nor scorn, he offered no judgments on the continent-sized country he was capturing with his camera, no judgments other than a kind of narrow-eyed wonder.
At the time of the book's publication, many did not see Mr. Frank's work that way. A Popular Photography reviewer agreed with Kerouac on the poetic quality of “The Americans"; but, put off by its often-scruffy subject matter and seemingly artless style, he denounced “this sad poem for sick people." Six decades later, the book looks vastly different: Yesterday's subversion has become today's unkempt appreciation.
In addition, “The Americans" profoundly influenced the work of two generations of photographers. The critic Janet Malcolm likened its creator to the painter who ushered in Impressionism. Mr. Frank, she wrote, was “the Manet of the new photography." What was once a revolutionary document now looks like a manual of late-20th-century photographic style. In redefining an art form, Mr. Frank had an impact on photography comparable to Marlon Brando's on acting, a few years earlier, and Bob Dylan's on popular music, a few years later.
"Never before," the photographer Joel Meyerowitz has written of "The Americans," "was there a book of photographs with the wholeness of literature and the clarity of a poem. Many photographers of my generation succumbed to his vision and through it saw the difficulties and potential of photography and the adventure in store for us were we to misread that work in our own inevitable ways."
The impact of Mr. Frank's work extended beyond photography and film. “I've always wished I could write songs the way he takes pictures," Bruce Springsteen once said.
Robert Frank was born in Zurich on Nov. 9, 1924, the son of Hermann and Regina Frank. His father was a German businessman who'd moved to Switzerland after World War I. Mr. Frank's interest in the United States and photography came early. As a boy, he clipped a photo of Franklin D. Roosevelt and placed it over his bed. As a teenager, he apprenticed himself to a local photographer and got his first photographic job, taking stills on a movie set, when he was 17.
Mr. Frank immigrated to the United States in 1947 and was almost immediately hired to work as a photographer for the fashion magazine Harper's Bazaar. “I could feel the possibilities," he said nearly half a century later of his first years in New York. “You could do anything, go anywhere; nobody really cared."
In 1950, he married the sculptor Mary (Lockspeiser) Frank. She and their two children accompanied Mr. Frank on parts of the 1955-56 cross-country travels in a 1950 Ford that produced “The Americans." It was a journey both mundane (Mr. Frank went to the American Automobile Association to plan his route) and exotic (suspicious of his accent, the Arkansas State Police sent his fingerprints to the FBI).
In its combining the commonplace and extraordinary, the journey was like something out of Kerouac's novel “On the Road." In fact, Mr. Frank collaborated with such Beat writers as Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. The best known of these collaborations is the film “Pull My Daisy," made in 1959, and Mr. Frank spent much of his time in subsequent years making experimental films. “When you make a film, you have a conversation," he said in a 1994 New York Times interview. “You have more contact with people. When you photograph, often you walk away."
Film also had the advantage of letting Mr. Frank get away from his old style. The astonishing influence “The Americans" had on other photographers dismayed him. As the '60s wore on, more and more “people would come by or send me photographs, and they looked like my photographs. Then I realized there was no more point. I wanted to move on."
Mr. Frank turned to more haphazard techniques of photography: marking up negatives, assembling collages, and emphasizing spontaneity at the expense of composition. An example of his later style is the album cover of the Rolling Stones album “Exile on Main Street," for which Mr. Frank provided the art. Mr. Frank also made a documentary film about the group's 1972 tour, “CS Blues," which the Stones banned for many years because of its graphic representations of backstage drug use and sexual situations.
In 1969, Mr. Frank built a house in Mabou, Nova Scotia, and started to divide his time between there and New York. Also in that year, he and Mary Frank divorced.
In 1972, Mr. Frank published a photographic autobiography, “The Lines of My Hand." An expanded edition appeared in 1989. A year later, he donated an archive of some 5,500 negatives, contact sheets, and prints to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the first time that institution had collected the work of a living photographer. The gallery organized a major retrospective of Mr. Frank's work in 1995. Other museums that organized exhibitions of Mr. Frank's work include New York's Museum of Modern Art; the George Eastman Museum, in Rochester, N.Y.; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; New York's Whitney Museum of Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
The many exhibitions devoted to Mr. Frank notwithstanding, the touchstone of his career remained “The Americans." The National Gallery organized a major show in observance of its 50th anniversary, "Looking In: Robert Frank's 'The Americans.' "
“I think that trip was almost pure intuition — I just kept on photographing," he wrote upon concluding his journey in 1956. “I kept on looking. . . . That made me work so hard until I knew I had something, but I didn't even know I had America."
He leaves his wife, June Leaf. A son, Pablo, died in 1994. A daughter, Andrea, died in a plane crash in 1974.

Interesting bears that came out of Vermont

Texto completo: Build-A-Bear Workshop was all over National Teddy Bear Day, billing it as the "BIGGEST" celebration ever. That same enthusiasm was missing from Vermont Teddy Bear Co.'s website and social media accounts the morning of the Sept. 9 holiday.
Though the Vermont company took a laid-back approach to the holiday (they did eventually add a post to their Facebook page around noon Monday), we took the excuse to look back at some of the company's most interesting bears.
1. The Vermont Teddy Bear Co.'s 2005 Valentine's bear that was outfitted in a straitjacket and came with commitment papers caused backlash from lawmakers, medical professionals and mental health advocates.
The "Crazy for You" bear even spurred then-Gov. Jim Douglas to denounce it saying, "Mental health is very serious. We should not stigmatize it further with these marketing efforts," according to a New York Times article.
2. Some people took exception to company's Giant Hunka Love bear that was advertised as the perfect Valentine's gift for your girlfriend or wife.
A contributor to Forbes blasted the 4-foot or 6-foot bears in a 2014 opinion piece for infantilizing grown women.
"Teddy bears are soft and suggest love and comfort, which is why they're generally an appropriate Valentine's Day gift for a young child or maybe a friend. Yet in a strange twist, the company has managed to sexualize the 'teddy bear,'" Sabrina Schaeffer wrote.
3. The company followed up in 2015 with its "Fifty Shades of Grey" bear for anyone who wanted to "dominate" Valentine's Day.
The erotic romance novel by English author E.L. James served as inspiration for this bear that held handcuffs in one hand and a black mask in the other.
"Bear seduces her with silky, smoky Grey fur; smoldering Grey eyes; a handsome grey suit and silver tie," Vermont Teddy Bear's website described at the time.
4) The "Bernie Bear" premiered in 2015 as the state's U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders made his bid to be president.
The 15-inch bear sported a tuft of Sanders-like unruly white hair along with glasses, a suit and a campaign pin.
"We just couldn't resist," Vermont Teddy Bear President Bill Shouldice said at the time. "Given Senator Bernie Sanders' well-known affinity for President Theodore Roosevelt, and our products' tie to the former President of the United States, it seemed only natural."
What exactly is the teddy bear's connection to the US presidency? The teddy bear was born in 1902 when President Theodore Roosevelt, known as an avid big game hunter, went on an unfruitful bear hunt, according to the U.S. National Park Service's website.
Roosevelt's attendants cornered a black bear and tied it to a tree for the president to shoot. He found it unsportsmanlike and refused. The act, or non-act, made national news and inspired a couple in Brooklyn to create a stuffed bear that they dedicated to the president.
With the president's approval, the couple mass produced the toy bears and founded the Ideal Toy Company.

Vermont Teddy Bear is offering a Fifty Shades of Grey bear on its website, named after the wildly popular erotic romance novel published in 2011.

Trump as TV character: Here’s help in understanding him

Texto completo: “Try to understand Donald Trump as a person with psychology and strategy and motivation, and you will inevitably spiral into confusion and covfefe. The key is to remember that Donald Trump is not a person. He’s a TV character.”
I quote the paragraph above (and most of what’s below) from an op-ed in the Sunday New York Times by the paper’s chief TV critic, James Poniewozik — a piece I gather he boiled down from a full-length book he wrote titled “Audience of One: Donald Trump, Television and the Fracturing of America.”
Trying to understand Donald Trump, or his appeal to the roughly 40 percent of Americans who approve of the job he is doing as president, has frustrated me for going on three years. Maybe Poniewozik gets it. At least I had that feeling reading his piece.
I watch plenty of TV, mostly news, sports and old movies. But I must confess, to my utter disgrace, I have never followed any of the gazillions of shows in the category of “reality TV,” which always strikes me as a hilarious name for a category that seems further from reality than a mediocre episode of “Leave It to Beaver.” But I don’t really know.

Perhaps a solution to two mysteries

But trying to understand what inspires Trump to constantly behave like such a jerk, and how this routine somehow got him a four-year term in the Oval Office has eluded me. And for a least a nanosecond, reading “Audience of One,” gave me a fleeting feeling that maybe this was the solution to both mysteries. I can’t explain Poniewozik’s theory any better than he does, so I’ll just pass along a taste. Writes he:
If you want to understand what President Trump will do in any situation, then, it’s more helpful to ask: What would TV do? What does TV want? It wants conflict. It wants excitement. If there is something that can blow up, it should blow up. It wants a fight. It wants more. It is always eating and never full. …
Donald Trump’s ‘Apprentice’ boardroom closed for business on Feb. 16, 2015, precisely four months before he announced his successful campaign for president. And also, it never closed. It expanded. It broke the fourth wall. We live inside it now.
Now, Mr. Trump re-creates the boardroom’s helter-skelter atmosphere every time he opens his mouth or his Twitter app. In place of the essentially dead White House press briefing, he walks out to the lawn in the morning and reporters gaggle around him like ‘Apprentice’ contestants awaiting the day’s task. He rails and complains and establishes the plot points for that day’s episode: Greenland! Jews! ‘I am the chosen one!’
As The Times has reported, before taking office, he told aides to think of every day as ‘an episode in a television show in which he vanquishes rivals.’
Mr. Trump has been playing himself instinctually as a character since the 1980s; it’s allowed him to maintain a profile even through bankruptcies and humiliations. But it’s also why, on the rare occasions he’s had to publicly attempt a role contrary to his nature — calling for healing from a script after a mass shooting, for instance — he sounds as stagey and inauthentic as an unrehearsed amateur doing a sitcom cameo.
His character shorthand is ‘Donald Trump, Fighter Guy Who Wins.’ …
There’s more, and I think maybe it’s brilliant. The whole piece is here. It makes me want to give up TV completely, but not while the Twins are in a pennant race.

New York Times deletes tweet calling Mao Zedong ‘one of history’s great revolutionary figures’

Texto completo: The New York Times' archive account deleted a tweet on Monday that posted their front page story reporting on Mao Zedong's death in 1976.
The tweet said, "Mao Zedong died on this day in 1976: The Times said he 'began as an obscure peasant' and 'died one of history's great revolutionary figures.'" In a subsequent tweet, NYT Archives said their previous tweet about Zedong "lacked critical historical context."
NYT Mao TweetTweet
Many criticized the NYT Archives' initial tweet for not mentioning how Zedong's communist "Great Leap Forward" policies lead to the deaths of over 45 million people.
The deaths vastly outnumber those killed by the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, where about 20 million people died in labor camps, forced collectivization that resulted in famines, and executions in purges. Under the regime of Adolf Hitler, 11 million were killed in the Holocaust.

Texto completo: NASSAU, Bahamas - The roof had blown clean off. Outside, the ocean surged, swallowing the land. Brent Lowe knew he had to escape - and take his 24-year-old son, who has cerebral palsy and can't walk, with him.
But Lowe had another problem. He's blind.
So he put his grown son on his shoulders, then stepped off his porch, he said. The swirling current outside came up to his chin.
"It was scary, so scary," said Brent Lowe, 49.
Clutching neighbors, he said he felt his way to the closest home still standing. It was five minutes - an eternity - away.
Stories of unlikely survival have slowly emerged in the days since Hurricane Dorian hit the Bahamas, pummeling the islands of Grand Bahama and Abaco for days before moving toward the Atlantic Seaboard.
While the damage has been visible from above, the full human toll is still far from certain, with 30 deaths confirmed so far and authorities warning that the real number may be much higher.
The death count "could be staggering," Dr. Duane Sands, the minister of health, who updated the toll late Thursday.
Some neighborhoods have been reduced to rubble, almost entirely flattened by the storm. In others, 95% of homes have been damaged or destroyed.
Thousands of people are now homeless, taking refuge in gymnasiums or churches, and authorities are bracing for an influx of bodies as the extent of the destruction becomes clear.
"We are embalming bodies so that we have more capacity as new bodies are brought in," Sands said. "We need to get coolers into Abaco and Grand Bahama, because we believe that we may not have the capacity to store the bodies."
Sandra Cooke, a resident of Nassau, the capital, said her sister-in-law had been trapped under a collapsed roof in the Abaco Islands.
At first, her brother couldn't find his wife - then the family dog detected her in the rubble. When there was a break in the storm, neighbors helped free her.
"She was trapped under the roof for 17 hours," Cooke said. She hired a private helicopter service to bring the rescued woman to Nassau, she said.
When Hurricane Dorian first made landfall Sunday, Lowe recalled, all of its fury seemed to bear down on him.
The storm raging outside was one of the most powerful ever to sweep through the Atlantic. Its eye was approaching, and the group of eight people inside Lowe's cement house was particularly vulnerable.
In addition to Lowe and his disabled son, neighbors whose homes had already been destroyed were also sheltering there. Among them were two children.
As the storm howled around them, Lowe said, the roof began to lift off, then slap back down. Abaco withstood sustained winds of up to 185 mph that day, with gusts that reached 220 mph. The group sought safety in the bathroom, where they huddled together and prayed, hoping for relief. Lowe's son was nestled inside the bathtub, he said.
That's when the roof flew away.
Exposed to the elements, each person had to step out into the storm. They clung to each other and set out to find refuge.
"I've never experienced anything like that in my life," said Lowe, who is no stranger to hurricanes but said he could never have imagined the terror of that day.
The group reached a neighbor's home. Lowe and his son hunkered down there for a day until a rescue bus was able to pick them up Monday and take them to a shelter.
On Tuesday night, he was evacuated to Nassau, where Brent Lowe can get the dialysis treatment he needs three times a week. His son had to stay in Abaco, in the care of Lowe's sister-in-law, he said.
"I came here with the clothes that I had on from Saturday," he said.
Although Lowe and his son are now safe, his ordeal is, in some ways, only beginning.
He didn't know if his eldest daughter made it through the storm, he said. The phone lines have been down for days, and communication with Abaco is very difficult.
"Right before we had the wind, I spoke with her," he said. "I wish I could have been able to call and ask somebody, you know, because I really was worried about them. I was worried about everybody."
So many people have been pushed from their homes by the hurricane that in Marsh Harbour, the main town on Abaco, as many as 2,000 people were seeking shelter in a clinic and a government complex. Officials warned that tent cities might have to be set up to accommodate the many survivors.
There are also environmental concerns. The Norwegian energy company Equinor said an oil storage terminal on the island of Grand Bahama had been damaged. The terminal was leaking, the company said, though it was too early to tell how much oil had spilled.
From the air, the storage tanks appeared to have no lids. The domed tops of five tanks were "gone," a company spokesman said.
Bahamian officials urged their citizens to be unified.
"There are no words to convey the grief we feel for our fellow Bahamians in the Abacos and Grand Bahama," Dionisio D'Aguilar, the tourism and aviation minister, said in a statement. "Now is the time to come together for our brothers and sisters in need, and help our country get back on its feet."
Like many of his neighbors, Lowe is now homeless. After a lifetime on the outskirts of Marsh Harbour - where he raised a family and worked as a butcher in a fish house until he lost his eyesight to diabetes - his home, his community and everything he built has been obliterated.
Still, Lowe wants to return to Abaco.
"I have to go," he said. "That's where my family is. My kids are there; my brothers, my sisters, they're all there."
But he is unsure of its future. The damage is catastrophic.
In the area where he lived, "90% of the houses are compromised," he said. "I'm talking about roofs gone, houses totally collapsed everywhere."
He added, "I'm just wondering where we're going to live when I go back home, what I'm going to do."

Texto completo: In a nation of 7,500 breweries, there's only one I ever pledged not to patronize: Special Ed's Brewery, in Galt, California.
Launched in 2016, Special Ed's staked its identity not on quality beer or even interesting branding. It made fun of people with special needs. Special Ed's slogan upon launch: "Ride the short bus to special beer." Its beer, the brewery claimed, was " 'tard tested, 'tard approved."
Iconoclasm has been among the craft beer industry's greatest strengths, but Special Ed's approach was the cruelest I've come across in 10 years of writing about the industry. It was the epitome of punching down.
For a few stubborn days, Special Ed's founder Ed Mason held fast to the brewery's name. Then, after meeting with parents of people with special needs, he agreed to change it to something far more ordinary: River Rock Brewery.
The hero of this story isn't Mason. It's a woman named Tricia Bowden, a Galt resident whose daughter is autistic. Bowden initially called for a boycott of Special Ed's, though at the time she also told the Sacramento Bee, "I would love to get to know him and love to be his friend because I feel like all of his other friends let him down."
After Special Ed's became River Rock, she didn't hesitate to forgive Mason.
"I believe in second chances," she said.
Bowden offered a lesson, and it's one I've considered many times in recent years. We have slid into an era of bloodthirsty vengeance, endlessly seeking our next villain and demanding action before asking questions. It's a zealousness shared by both sides of the political spectrum.
The issue arose yet again last week with the jaw-dropping quip by a white Oklahoma City morning news anchor, Alex Housden, who said her black co-anchor, Jason Hackett, looked similar to a gorilla at the zoo.
Housden tearfully apologized live on air the next day: "I said something yesterday that was inconsiderate, it was inappropriate and I hurt people." She told Hackett she loved him and called him one of her best friends, saying she "would never do anything on purpose to hurt you." She didn't just come across as "sorry." She seemed gutted. As she should.
Hackett handled the matter gracefully, accepting his colleague's apology, but without excusing the behavior. He affirmed Housden as a close friend but made clear she was wrong. He called for the proverbial "teachable moment."
"We have to understand each other's backgrounds and the words that hurt, the words that cut deep, and we have to find a way to replace those words with love and words of affirmation," Hackett said.
Social media debated the sincerity of Housden's apology and she was, of course, crucified on Twitter. ("Future racist in training," one person replied to a photo Housden had shared of herself from third grade.)
Hackett's choice to forgive his colleague was entirely his own; it would be impossible to blame him if he had decided not to.
But the broader issue, and the one we seem increasingly conditioned against, is social forgiveness: acknowledging that people make mistakes, weighing the context, considering the substance of the apology and then implementing the "teachable moment." We can gain far more from that discussion than we do from vengeance.
We're in a particularly thorny and uncomfortable time. Black Lives Matter has helped spark a conversation about systemic racial oppression. #MeToo pulled back the curtain on the aggression women navigate daily. Immigrants have been demonized, endangering all people of color -- whether two Indian men in a bar or a store full of Walmart shoppers. Synagogues, mosques, churches and a Sikh temple have been attacked. And a large swath of the nation seems to struggle to see a place for itself in a rapidly changing land.
The tensions are amplified by a president who is anything but presidential, thriving on the politics of division, and amplified further by the relentless drumbeat of social media. (Worse still, those two things collide daily.)
We're left to vent anger, looking for someone to blame and an enemy to castigate. But forgiveness doesn't only benefit those being forgiven -- it's helps us. Says the International Forgiveness Institute at the University of Wisconsin (yes, that's a thing, and forgiveness has even become a field of scholarship): "Forgiveness creates a higher quality of life, a healthier body and a more positive attitude. It can reduce anger, bitterness, resentment and depression."
Forgiveness, of course, is in the eye of the beholder. It depends on context. It depends on remorse -- and action.
Consider Joe Walsh, the suburban congressman turned Republican shock jock, who is on an apology tour of sorts while trying to present himself as an alternative to Donald Trump.
Walsh's habit of ignorant and inflammatory tweets are well documented, from questioning Barack Obama's religion to mocking Sandy Hook parents, calling for "no more Muslims in the US" to threatening to take up arms if Trump didn't win in 2016.
Now he's sorry for his "share of controversy." Sort of.
"We now see where this can lead," Walsh wrote in The New York Times. "There's no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them."
Not exactly ringing with Housdenesque sincerity. While Walsh is right about the reasons to run against Trump -- "He's nuts, he's erratic, he's cruel, he stokes bigotry" -- Walsh's unhinged rhetoric and lack of remorse show he's not someone to be forgiven. He's someone to be held accountable.
But just as some people must be held accountable, others are best forgiven. In an era of bottomless rage, it's in all our interests.
And so Alex Housden remains employed. River Rock Brewery is still open. And I'd gladly join Tricia Bowden there to tip back a beer or two.

Texto completo: There’ll always be an England, a point reinforced last week by the Conservative Party revolt against Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s attempt to make an end-run around Parliament and leave the European Union on Oct. 31 on his own terms — without a deal to manage future relations between Britain and the European trade and customs union.
Enough of Johnson’s fellow Conservatives rebelled to block that plan, which many economists and others predict would be a disaster for Great Britain, perhaps leading to shortages of food, fuel and medicine as well as devastating some manufacturers. Johnson blithely dismisses this analysis as fear-mongering, but reports by his own government do not sustain that rosy view, according to The New York Times.
But perhaps more than the prospect of a catastrophic Brexit, what enraged the score of Conservatives who defected was Johnson’s attempt to circumvent consideration of the issue by suspending sittings of Parliament for five weeks before the end-of-October deadline. That amounted, in their view, to trampling on England’s unwritten constitution and overturning political norms, something they were unwilling to countenance, even from a Conservative government.
Johnson, who bears a striking political resemblance to President Donald Trump, retaliated by purging the rebels from the party for disloyalty. Nonetheless, they have apparently thwarted his Brexit machinations for the time being, and he has called for a general election to determine the country’s future course in — or out of — Europe.
The terms on which Britain leaves the European Union are certainly important, but the most significant effect of this revolt, the ringleaders of which included several of the party’s longest-serving and most distinguished members, may be that it draws a line in the sand against attempts to subvert the democratic process. It represents the most stinging rebuke yet to the bully-boy tactics of right-wing populism since the global return of the nativists began a few years ago.
The contrast with the United States could not be starker. Here, craven Republican officeholders have swallowed the Trump administration’s worse excesses without even gagging. We do not refer to issues such as the ruinous trade war with China; that’s squarely within the realm of partisan politics. But the president’s overt and covert courting of white supremacists; his Twitter attacks on people of color; his denial of Russian election interference; his attempts to destroy confidence in the courts, the election system and the free press all directly target the democratic process itself. Conservatives of good conscience are obliged to stand up and speak the truth. So far they have shown no inclination to do so.
That brings us New Hampshire, where Corey Lewandowski, the president’s former campaign manager, is thinking about seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat of decidedly moderate outlook. Lewandowski’s slash-and-burn persona has been aptly captured in a single word by former U.S. Sen. Judd Gregg: “thug.”
Gov. Chris Sununu, who himself has showed distinct signs of quietly knuckling under to the Trump brand of thuggery while attempting to burnish his image as a moderate, is said to worry that a Republican ticket headed by Lewandowski could result in an electoral debacle for Republicans in New Hampshire next year, a view that many party leaders in the state are thought to share. Maybe if their own political hides are at risk, they will see the light and repudiate Trumpism and the threat it poses to the political norms that the state has traditionally embraced.

Texto completo: Headnote Breaking Barriers in Ballet
Misty Copeland had the world of ballet standing still, when she made history as the first Black female principal dancer to the prestigious American Ballet Theatre (ABT) in 2015, just months after becoming the first Black woman to perform the lead role of "Odette" in ABT's coveted "Black Swan" in the winter of 2014.
Determined to shatter the glass ceiling of the ballet world, on Sep. 11, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) will honor Misty Copeland with their esteemed Trailblazer Award during the CBC's annual "Celebration of the Arts" event-an award that Copeland deemed as not only an honor but also a necessity.

"It's so important for other Black dancers to see a possibdity, a future for themselves, in a world that still doesn't include many other Black ballerinas," Copeland said.
"There's definitely still a glass ceiling in the ballet world," Copeland continued. "There's only one Black principal dancer in the American Ballet Theatre in their entire almost 80-year history and a lot of people don't have the understanding that just because it's been done once, doesn't meant that that problem goes away... having one Black president didn't mean that racism didn't exist."
"If I didn't have art in my life, then I wouldn't be the articulate, confident person that I am today. Fields in STEM are important but the arts are also so vital... not every child learns the same way and sometimes the missing link is art."
Growing up as the fourth child of six in underserved areas of San Pedro, California, Copeland spoke to a time where she and her five other siblings found themselves all living in a small motel after her mother's marriage to her fourth husband became abusive - both emotionally and physically - to Copeland's mother and all of her children.
Despite the economic and social hardships, Copeland said that she was able to find solace and her voice through the world of dance. At the age of 13, the ballet lessons that she began taking at at the local Boys and Girls Club would eventually allow her to move in with her teacher's family and eventually prepare her to make history.
"It's been 25 years now that I've been a part of classical ballet and I still have that same fire," Copeland said. "1 think for me it was initially out of my own need, as a 13-year old girl growing up in underprivileged areas, to find structure, something I never had, and dance provided exactly what I needed for that time in my life."
"I represent ballet and any child that needs to see someone persevere," Copeland continued. "What it means to be an underdog and to be mentored and have an amazing support system and represent that American dream."
Since joining the American Ballet Theatre in 2001, Copeland has gone on to be inducted into the Boys & Girls Club National Hall of Fame; serve on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, under the Obama administration; publish three books, including the New York Times Bestselling memoir, "Life in Motion;" secure her own clothing line with Under Armour; and receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Hartford. All the while Copeland has been an ardent beliver in reminding others that "representation is important."
"I'm still a Black ballerina and a Black woman in this world and that doesn't just disappear with titles," Copeland said. "The more I use my visibility, my platform, my voice, to continue to speak about diversity both in front of the scenes and behind them, the more I'll be able to help change the directory of dance."
"A lot of underserved areas and youth either don't receive access to dance courses or don't receive quality training, which limits their chances of going even further when that time comes," Copeland continued. "My hope, is that with my platform. I can continue this conversation to bring about change, to show younger people how to own their own power, to embrace who they are, to walk in their own path and to be represented."

Texto completo: Headnote Breaking Barriers in Ballet
Misty Copeland had the world of ballet standing still, when she made history as the first Black female principal dancer to the prestigious American Ballet Theatre (ABT) in 2015, just months after becoming the first Black woman to perform the lead role of "Odette" in ABT's coveted "Black Swan" in the winter of 2014.
Determined to shatter the glass ceiling of the ballet world, on Sep. 11, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) will honor Misty Copeland with their esteemed Trailblazer Award during the CBC's annual "Celebration of the Arts" event-an award that Copeland deemed as not only an honor but also a necessity.

"It's so important for other Black dancers to see a possibility, a future for themselves, in a world that still doesn't include many other Black ballerinas," Copeland said.
"There's definitely still a glass ceiling in the ballet world," Copeland continued. "There's only one Black principal dancer in the American Ballet Theatre in their entire almost 80-year history and a lot of people don't have the understanding that just because it's been done once, doesn't meant that that problem goes away... having one Black president didn't mean that racism didn't exist."
"If I didn't have art in my life, then I wouldn't be the articulate, confident person that I am today. Fields in STEM are important but the arts are also so vital... not every child learns the same way and sometimes the missing link is art."
Growing up as the fourth child of six in underserved areas of San Pedro, California, Copeland spoke to a time where she and her five other siblings found themselves all living in a small motel after her mother's marriage to her fourth husband became abusive - both emotionally and physically - to Copeland's mother and all of her children.
Despite the economic and social hardships, Copeland said that she was able to find solace and her voice through the world of dance. At the age of 13, the ballet lessons that she began taking at at the local Boys and Girls Club would eventually allow her to move in with her teacher's family and eventually prepare her to make history.
"It's been 25 years now that I've been a part of classical ballet and I still have that same fire," Copeland said. "I think for me it was initially out of my own need, as a 13-year old girl growing up in underprivileged areas, to find structure, something I never had, and dance provided exactly what I needed for that time in my life."
"I represent ballet and any child that needs to see someone persevere," Copeland continued. "What it means to be an underdog and to be mentored and have an amazing support system and represent that American dream."
Since joining the American Ballet Theatre in 2001. Copeland has gone on to be inducted into the Boys & Girls Club National Hall of Fame; serve on the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition, under the Obama administration; publish three books, including the New York Times Bestselling memoir, "Life in Motion;" secure her own clothing line with Under Armour; and receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Hartford. All the while Copeland has been an ardent beliver in reminding others that "representation is important."
"I'm still a Black ballerina and a Black woman in this world and that doesn't just disappear with titles," Copeland said. "The more I use my visibility, my platform, my voice, to continue to speak about diversity both in front of the scenes and behind them, the more I'll be able to help change the directory of dance."
"A lot of underserved areas and youth either don't receive access to dance courses or don't receive quality training, which limits their chances of going even further when that time comes," Copeland continued. "My hope, is that with my platform, I can continue this conversation to bring about change, to show younger people how to own their own power, to embrace who they are, to walk in their own path and to be represented."

Administración Trump estudia si reduce aún más el ingreso de refugiados, según reportes

Texto completo: Entre las medidas en tema de políticas de inmigración que la administración del presidente, Donald Trump, evalúa actualmente, también está la posible reducción del número de refugiados que pueden entrar en EEUU.
La decisión del Gobierno se acerca, según reporta The New York Times y confirma The Associated Press. Ambos medios aseguran que funcionarios de la Casa Blanca tienen prevista una reunión de alto nivel sobre este tema para el martes de la semana que viene. El objetivo es discutir a qué cifra anual de refugiados se permitirá el ingreso, explican.
Como ya contó también Noticias Telemundo, el 1 de octubre empieza el nuevo año fiscal, una fecha clave para fijar el cupo de refugiados admisibles en los siguiente 12 meses. La administración Trump tiene intención de fijar el nuevo cupo antes de esa fecha, según AP.
Esta agencia asegura que no se ha llegado todavía a una decisión. Algunos funcionarios de la administración que han hablado bajo la condición de anonimato a esta agencia consideran que el número de refugiados se tendría que reducir debido a que EEUU está bajo presión por el aumento de solicitudes de asilo en la frontera sur y de otros países afectados por guerras o graves desastres naturales.
La jurisdicción prevé una diferencia entre las dos categorías: la primera, el estatus de refugiado, se refiere a personas consideradas bajo graves amenazas que se encuentran fuera de EEUU y que no pueden volver a su país de origen.
La segunda se asocia en cambio a migrantes que ya se encuentran en territorio nacional o en el intento de entrar en el país y que aseguran que estarían en peligro si vuelven a sus países de origen.
El Times afirma que el Gobierno baraja distintas opciones. Según las fuentes consultadas por este periódico, una prevé una limitación del número de refugiados que podría reducirlo a cero. Esta idea ha sido propuesta por un alto oficial de la administración. El primer medio que habló de esta posibilidad fue la revista Politico en julio.
Otra idea, confirmada también por AP, es establecer un máximo de 10,000 ó 15,000 ingresos anuales. El cupo establecido para este año fiscal fue de 30,000 refugiados, 15,000 menos que para 2018. El año fiscal anterior, cuando estaba en vigor la meta fijada bajo la administración de Barack Obama, el total de admisibles era de 110,000.
Ambas ideas harían que EEUU renunciara a su posición de país que más refugiados acoge en el mundo, destaca el rotativo neoyorquino.
La decisión tiene que tomarla el presidente Trump, según afirmó una fuente del Departamento de Estado. Pero la Casa Blanca todavía no ha hecho comentarios oficiales al respecto.
Un actual funcionario de la administración y varios exfuncionarios de la misma dijeron al Times que uno de los que más presionan para reducir ulteriormente el número de refugiados es Stephen Miller, el principal asesor de Trump en materia de inmigración.
Miembros de grupos de defensa del programa de refugiados, activo en EEUU desde 1980, indican que para la puesta en marcha de la medida será clave la posición de Mark T. Esper, secretario de Defensa desde el pasado julio.
Su antecesor, Jim Mattis, se opuso a grandes recortes del número de refugiados admisibles, alegando que estos afectarían los intereses militares de EEUU en el mundo. Un alto funcionario afirmó que la posición de Esper al respecto todavía se desconoce. Militares retirados y grupos de ayuda humanitaria están intentando convencerlo a tomar una postura parecida a la de Matis.
Organismos implicados en la ayuda humanitaria y reasentamiento de refugiados consultados por Noticias Telemundo consideraron que sería un desatino y una “catástrofe” continuar reduciendo el ingreso de refugiados, especialmente debido a la crisis global de 26 millones de refugiados que huyen de la violencia y persecución.
Hans Van de Weerd, vicepresidente del programa para refugiados del “Comité Internacional para Rescates” (IRC, por su sigla en inglés), dijo que si eventualmente la Administración baja a cero el número de refugiados, eso sería algo “catastrófico” para personas que dependen del reasentamiento para sobrevivir.
La decisión pondría en entredicho la credibilidad e influencia de EEUU en el mundo y sería otro “golpe bajo” de una Administración que ya implementó una veda a inmigrantes de países con mayoría musulmana, ha impuesto restricciones al proceso de asilo, ha separado familias en la frontera sur, y mantiene una política de detención de niños migrantes, agregó Van de Weerd.
A la fecha del 6 de septiembre, la cifra de refugiados aceptados a partir del pasado 1 de octubre fue de 28,501, según AP . El año fiscal pasado, se admitieron 22,491. Los latinoamericanos admitidos como refugiados en el año fiscal 2019 fueron poco más de 600, según el Centro de Procesamiento de Refugiados del Departamento de Estado.

Shaky summer box office points to larger issues

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES - This was supposed to be the summer when Hollywood blew the doors off theaters. Stay home and stream? Not with Simba, Spider-Man, John Wick, Snowball, Buzz Light-year, Aladdin, the X-Men and Godzilla on the way.
Instead, the film business finds itself lagging last year's surge and facing questions about why. Some box office analysts point to 20th Century Fox, which imploded in Rupert Murdoch's handoff to Disney and delivered three bombs in a row. Others say moviegoing has become too expensive - concessions, tickets, babysitters - especially given the growing array of low-priced at-home entertainment options that are often already part of a household's budget.
Or is something bigger going on? "It is another sign that the broader economy is in a fragile place," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, noting that some other leisure businesses - Disney theme parks, Major League Baseball games - also had a soft summer.
From the first weekend in May to Labor Day, a period that can account for as much as 40% of annual movie ticket sales, box office revenue in the United States and Canada is expected to total about $4.32 billion, a 2% decline from the same period last year, according to Comscore.
For the year, revenue from ticket sales is down 6.3%, which roughly translates to a 5% decline in attendance. That is despite the runaway success of "Avengers: Endgame," the Disney-Marvel superhero movie that arrived in late April end collected a record-breaking $2.8 billion worldwide, nearly $860 million of that in North America.
The specialty box office has been in particularly rough shape. Between January and Aug. 25, combined ticket sales for the 20 largest art film distributors (Fox Searchlight, Magnolia and the like) fell 45% from the same period last year, according to Box Office Mojo data.
The movie business ebbs and flows depending on factors that vary from reviews to the weather. Ticket sales soared 15% last summer in part because of pent-up demand; the "Incredibles" series from Pixar returned after a 14-year hiatus, and "Crazy Rich Asians" was the first studio movie in 25 years to tell a contemporary Asian story. The art-house sector is extra-dependent on quality, and distributors say gems have been in short supply lately, in part because Netflix has snapped up so many of them (for premium prices).
Hollywood could make up ground in the coming months with potential blockbusters like "It: Chapter 2," "Joker," "Frozen 2," "Jumanji:, The Next Level," "Cats" and "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." Specialty distributors have high hopes for Bong Joon-ho's "Parasite" (Neon), which was the top prizewinner at Cannes, and "Downton Abbey" (Focus Features).
But box office experts say the theatrical landscape has shifted, possibly permanently. Before it drowned in red ink, Movie Pass, the cut-rate ticket subscription service, trained fans (especially younger one;) to expect deep discounts. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime have also proliferated, offering huge catalogs of movies and shows for acomparatively own price. At this point, many living rooms are equipped with large flat-screen televisions.
"Pricing was never an impediment to going to the movies, and it is now," said Chris Aronson, a former distribution chief for 20th Century Fox who now runs his own consultancy. "Streaming services have come along with such attractively priced entertainment that theaters can't compete, except on a handful of event movies that people absolutsly must see."
Out-of-home entertainment had a down summer in general. Attendance at Major League Baseball games is expected to fall for the fourth consecutive season, according to Two Circles, a sports marketing agency. Broadway attendance has declined 2.6% from a year earlier, according to the Broadway League. Full data was not yet available for concerts, but early numbers suggest a decline, according to statistics from Pollstar, a trade publication.
Attendance eased 3% at Disney theme park resorts in Florida and California in the April-June period, according to the company's quarterly financial report. National Park Service data shows that Yellowstone National Park had fewer visitors in May, June and July.
"Recreation is, of course, a discretionary purchase, and that it has gone soft reflects greater caution by consumers," Zandi said.
On a studio-by-studio basis, Hollywood's summer was severely lopsided. The top 10 movies generated $2.57 billion in domestic ticket sales, and Disney commanded 51% of that total -with just three films: "The Lion King," "Toy Story 4" and "Aladdin." The No. 1 movie of the summer was "The Lion King," a remake that took in $523.5 million in North America and $1 billion overseas (and is still playing).
Disney was humbled, however, by the performance of its newly acquired 20th Century Fox division, which delivered a hall-of-fame bomb: "Dark Phoenix," an X-Men movie, cost an estimated $350 million to make and market and collected $252 million worldwide, roughly half of which goes to theater owners. Two other Fox movies, "Stuber" and "The Art of Racing in the Rain," also fizzled at the box office. All were well in the works before the Disney deal.
Sony Pictures Entertainment accomplished a unique feat, releasing a juggernaut superhero sequel, "Spider-Man: Far From Home," and a completely original blockbuster, "Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood." No other studio showed that range.
"We believe in balance, and you can see this exact strategy in the rest of our year," said Thomas E. Roth-man, Sony's movie chief, noting the "Jumanji" sequel and an original drama, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood," which stars Tom Hanks as the television personality Fred Rogers.
"As strong as the audience is for superheroes and sequels, we limit ourselves to serving that audience at our peril," Rothman said. "It will ultimately narrow the business. We have to think about every audience."
Sony misfired with "Men in Black International" in June, but the studio limited its financial exposure on that science-fiction film by bringing in outside financiers to share the production costs. "We wish it had gotten more enthusiasm," Rothman said.
For the year, Sony is a whisper away from Warner Bros, in domestic market share, a standing that drew double takes in Hollywood. Just a few years ago, Sony was sputtering and Warner was the film industry's superpower. But Warner, now owned by AT&T, has struggled in recent months.

A press secretary who redefines the job

Texto completo: Stephanie Grisham became President Trump’s third press secretary during the first week of summer. But Labor Day passed without Grisham giving her debut White House briefing or hosting the regular driveway gaggles that emerged as a substitute.
“I haven’t seen a need yet,” she told the Washington Examiner in a broad exchange reflecting on her first months on the job.
But Grisham, 42, has been busy behind the scenes as Trump’s top press surrogate. The mother of two and veteran of Arizona GOP politics has generated goodwill among many reporters while issuing biting rebukes of commentators hostile to Trump.
During her first days on the job, Grisham physically confronted North Korean guards who sought to block reporters from covering a Trump meeting with Kim Jong Un inside the Demilitarized Zone. “Go! Go!” she shouted, leaning her body into a guard.
She downplayed reported bruises, but the heroics were the talk of journalists’ West Wing workspaces. Grisham “[made] her first mark in the job by fighting, literally and physically, for press access,” wrote New York Times White House reporter Peter Baker.
Grisham, who also serves as White House communications director while keeping her old job as first lady Melania Trump’s communications director, is known for her understated demeanor and as a Trump loyalist since the 2016 campaign. When ex-White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci questioned Trump’s mental fitness, she gave a scorching rebuttal of “his ravenous appetite for attention.”
Whereas her predecessors found themselves subject to Saturday Night Live impersonations and accusations of flubbing facts during tense exchanges, Grisham’s interactions with reporters generally feature collegial sit-downs in her office.
Whether she ever takes to the White House briefing room podium is ultimately “up to the president,” she said.
Trump tweeted this year that he had instructed then-press secretary Sarah Sanders to stop giving briefings because “the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately.”
Grisham’s tenure has not been entirely devoid of clashes. In one of the first major controversies involving her office, Grisham approved the suspension of a Playboy magazine reporter’s press badge over a Rose Garden shouting match with guests. The decision was reversed by a judge.
Now that you have the job, what is most surprising about the role?
There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work that needs to be done. Meetings, managing staff, answering emails, talking to press, travel and logistical issues, etc. I think most of the country knows this role as forward facing, but that’s actually a small part of the job.
At least for now, you redefined the job by receding from the spotlight. What's going on behind the scenes?
I have taken the first two months to meet with my press and communications teams, West Wing staff, and members of the media. I have been working to get up to speed on policy and have also done two international trips, as well as domestic travel with the president.
Are you considering other changes to press operations?
I think we are in a very good place right now — my teams are incredible, and the White House is lucky to have them. The goal of this office is to represent the president and first lady, communicate the work of this administration to the country, and work to provide information to the press corps.
During your first weekend on the job you confronted North Korean guards to ensure press access at the DMZ. How did reporters respond?
Members of the media were grateful to our entire team on the ground. Behind the scenes, the press corps knows how hard this administration works on their behalf to get them access to events, it just never gets reported. At the G-7 two weeks ago, the American press corps had vastly more access than any other country and that was because people at every level worked on their behalf to ensure they were represented.
You haven’t given a briefing, or regular gaggles on the driveway. Are there certain events that require an in-person address from you?
There could be at some point. Ultimately, it is up to the president, and he is more accessible than any president in modern history, so I haven’t seen a need yet. I am available 24/7 and talk to reporters one-on-one every day. That seems to be working well for now.
Have you been training for briefings? Are there missteps you’d like to avoid?
I don’t want to get drawn into the theater of it all — and that is what it has become. I believe briefings and on-camera gaggles should communicate the president’s policies and messages to the country, not get ratings for networks or camera time and contributor contracts for reporters.
Sean Spicer and Sarah Sanders famously clashed with reporters on TV. You haven’t. Has that helped you build relationships with reporters?
Sean and Sarah are good friends of mine, and I learned a lot from both of them. To be honest, I haven’t had time to think about our differences — I am focused on how I can best serve the president and first lady.
Do you see a point where you step away from the East Wing and focus solely on the West Wing?
I hope I never step away from the East Wing. I respect Mrs. Trump very much and still have a lot to learn from her.
How much did you cooperate for Kate Bennett's forthcoming Free, Melania book?
I answered some questions, nothing major.
How do you balance the needs of the first lady and the president when their demands are not in sync? Have you ever felt put in the middle?
I have not. They are each independent individuals, which I celebrate. I am honored that I have a role in communicating to people how much they each love this country.
How have you balanced being a mom with essentially doing three jobs at once?
That one has been tough. Mom guilt is the worst. I am very close to both of my sons, and we make it work. They are my world, and time in the White House is temporary, and they each know that. It is my hope that by watching their mom achieve her ultimate professional goal and serve this country, they know they can do anything they put their minds to.
How have your sons responded to your recent job change?
My oldest and I are a lot alike — and he is very proud, though he’ll never admit that! My youngest has struggled with it a bit more because people at his school have been less than kind at times.
How many hours of sleep do you get a night?
It varies. I’d say between four and six hours. Having a new puppy in the house isn’t helping with my goal of a full night’s sleep.
You seem to be busier than ever. Why get a dog now?
“You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.” — President Harry S. Truman
What’s something you do for fun in your spare time?
As basic as it sounds, time with my friends and family is more important than ever these days. Taking time to sit and laugh means everything.
Aside from your new office, do you have a favorite place to spend time at the White House?
The Blue Room on the State Floor. If it is a challenging day, I go in there and look toward the South Lawn — you can see the fountain and Monument, and it reminds me of how grateful I am to be here.

Texto completo: The initial arrival of European explorers in the Americas marks the ruination of the land's founders by disease, malnutrition and violence.
Native American history in the U.S. includes a timeline of displacement, enslavement and population decline. The federal holiday on Oct. 12 celebrating the explorer who started European colonization, for some, represents a violent history of western colonialism.
Instead of continuing to honor the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus who exposed the Americas for conquest, at least two Montgomery residents are pushing for the city to rename Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.
In April, the New York Times reported at least six states and 130 cities and towns have now renamed the holiday.
Tuesday, Tori Jackson and Valerie Adams approached the Montgomery City Council with a request to change Columbus Day to Indigenous People's Day.
"My grandmother instilled in me that Native Americans were here before Columbus stepped foot here," Jackson told the Advertiser.
Adams referenced Native American contributions to the country, mentioning code talkers that helped win World War II, giving examples of how indigenous people have succeeded in America regardless of a history of atrocity.
"We have survived. We have thrived. We have adapted our languages. We're still here," Adams told the City Council.
Jackson, who is of Muskhogean ancestry, told the Advertiser that Native Americans have little representation yet so many tribes span the U.S. There are 573 federally recognized Indian Nations in the U.S. (tribes, nations, bands, pueblos, communities and native villages), according to the National Congress of Native Americans.
Jackson represents historical Native American figures in art, painting with a purpose of educating people on the history of indigenous people. Changing the name of the holiday would be a peaceful approach to educating people about the facts, she said.
Jackson said she's heard concerns that renaming the holiday would abolish it, but that isn't the case.
"A lot of people are scared we're going to take away their federal holiday. We just want it to be known that it's not a good thing to celebrate," she said.
Alabama did combine two other recognized holidays with Columbus Day. Adams addressed Alabama's unusual three-part holiday when she and Jackson approached the council saying the mingled celebration wasn't in line with the movement.
"Alabama did, under (Gov. Don) Siegelman, change to Columbus Day/American Indian Heritage Day/Fraternal Day, so we feel like starting at this level two of those are out of place of what's trying to happen across the nation," Adams said.
Mayor Todd Strange said he appreciated the conviction of residents to bring the issue before the City Council, recognizing the Poarch Creek tribe.
"Our city owes a debt of gratitude to all Native Americans, especially the Poarch Creek of Alabama for their continued support of projects and community-centered programs that enhance quality of life in the River Region," Strange wrote in an e-mail.
Poarch Creek is the only federally recognized tribe in Alabama. Jackson said it's problematic many don't realize there are other Native Americans in Alabama that do not live on the Creek Indian Reservation and are not part of the Poarch Creek tribe.
"I, along with many others, do not reside in Poarch. I am here, in Montgomery, Alabama," Jackson said.
Digressions aside, Strange said the city's bearing on renaming Columbus Day to Indigenous Day is moot.
"Our stance on renaming any holiday, including Columbus Day, is moot since the city adheres to federal direction for holiday observance as outlined by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management," Strange said.
Charles Jinright, president of the City Council, reiterated the mayor's point saying the City Council doesn't have authority to rename the holiday. Montgomery observes state holidays and would only be able to rename the holiday if state or federal lawmakers did, he said.
"We wouldn't have any input on that. That'd be your state representatives or your federal representatives," Jinright said.
City Councilman Richard Bollinger said he's open to a discussion, but renaming the holiday wouldn't change history.
"You can't change history. Too many people are backward looking rather than forward looking," Bollinger told the Advertiser in a phone conversation.
After Adams and Jackson finished their presentation, Jackson told the Advertiser it seemed some of the council members were hesitant to the idea, which was disappointing.

Texto completo: Recent comments by President Trump have thrown some cold water on hopes that he will soon order the IRS to index the capital gains tax, ending the taxation of phantom, inflationary gains.
"I've studied indexing for a long time and I think it will be perceived — if I do it — as somewhat elitist. I don't want to do that," President Trump recently told a gaggle of reporters at the White House.
Does that mean the president now disagrees with his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, who has doggedly pursued capital gains indexing for years? Does it mean advocates of the policy change should move on to something else?
Absolutely not.
The president's reluctance is directly related to dishonest headlines from the New York Times and elsewhere that frame indexing as a tax cut for the rich. The president is not concerned about the substance of the policy or his legal authority to implement it, but rather the perception — the politics of it.
If there was any doubt that the president is still very much considering this big, beautiful tax cut that Nancy Pelosi can't stop, he put that to rest with a new trial balloon tweet just a week after his public comments. Trump asked if capital gains indexing is "An idea liked by many?" with a retweet of Steve Forbes linking to an article endorsing the idea written by Sen. Ted Cruz and Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist.
President Trump is conducting a live focus group on the issue. He wants to know whether the media frame about "another tax cut for the rich" prevails among his supporters and the general public.
So we need to engage that argument and defeat it. Fortunately the facts are on our side.
IRS data show 26 million tax returns paid capital gains tax in 2016, 80 percent of whom made less than $200,000 and 56 percent made less than $100,000. And that understates how widespread the benefits would be because the majority of American households own long-lived assets like homes, mutual funds, and stocks that they will sell someday, representing years and possibly decades of accumulated value. The year they sell they will be "rich" according to income — but only for that one year. Taxing years or decades of inflation because a family looks rich on paper for that one year is wrong.
Democrats are howling at the thought of President Trump bypassing Nancy Pelosi and ending the capital gains inflation tax via executive order — which he has acknowledged he has clear legal authority to do. But Nancy Pelosi voted for capital gains indexing herself in 1992 — as did Maxine Waters, Bernie Sanders, and Chuck Schumer. Was it "for the rich" then?
Schumer even gave a floor speech in support of the idea, saying: "If we really want to increase growth, there are proposals that we can do. I would be for indexing all capital gains."
The bottom line is that taxing inflationary gains is wrong and economically destructive — and President Trump has the power to fix it. He should not be deterred by disingenuous Democrats or their media allies.

Mattis's relish for books a stark contrast to Trump's apathy

Texto completo: "If you haven't read hundreds of books, you are functionally illiterate, and you will be incompetent, because your personal experiences alone aren't broad enough to sustain you," Jim Mattis writes in his memoir, which came out Tuesday. "Any commander who claims he is 'too busy to read' is going to fill body bags with his troops as he learns the hard way."
The commander in chief has repeatedly said that he's too busy to read. "I never have. I'm always busy doing a lot. Now I'm more busy, I guess, than ever before," Donald Trump told The Washington Post in 2016.
"Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead" is not the kind of tell-all that many of Trump's critics hoped for. But there are plenty of those for sale. Nine months after he resigned in protest, Mattis remains unwilling to speak candidly about his 712 days as secretary of defense. Instead the book is entirely a memoir about four decades as an officer in the Marine Corps - with references to Trump only in the first and final pages. The book is chock full, however, of implicit and illuminating contrasts between Mattis's management style and Trump's.
Mattis amassed a private collection of more than 7,000 books, despite deployments around the world. "Reading sheds light on the dark path ahead," he explains. "By traveling into the past, I enhance my grasp of the present."
In a series of interviews with The Post's Marc Fisher three years ago, Trump was adamant that he does not need to read extensively because he reaches the right decisions "with very little knowledge other than the knowledge I [already] had, plus the words 'common sense,' because I have a lot of common sense and I have a lot of business ability."
Trump also insisted that he does not need to read anything that's long because he absorbs complex issues quickly. "I'm a very efficient guy," he said.
Mattis, who prefers the nickname "Warrior Monk" to "Mad Dog," repeatedly leans on his bibliomania throughout his 300-page book. The book reads like a literature review at times, as the 68-year-old recommends dozens of titles and name-checks too many authors to mention here. He also makes time to mock the scholars who said after the Cold War that it was "the end of history."
The way some people prepare for a marathon, Mattis challenges himself intellectually by picking some battle or area of history where he's weak. Then he fixates on the subject and reads everything he can find until he feels like an expert. "Living in history builds your own shock absorber, because you'll learn that there are lots of old solutions to new problems," he explains. "Strategy is hard unless you're a dilettante. You must think until your head hurts."
Mattis is partial to studying Roman generals and historians, from Marcus Aurelius and Scipio Africanus to Tacitus. "I followed Caesar across Gaul," he writes wistfully. "I marveled at how the plain prose of [Ulysses] Grant and [William Tecumseh] Sherman revealed the value of steely determination. . . . Biographies of . . . Native American leaders, of wartime political leaders and sergeants, and of strategic thinkers from Sun Tzu to Colin Gray have guided me through tough challenges." Mattis argues that intellectual rigor is just as important as physical rigor to excel in his beloved corps.
The president's disinterest in reading books is historically unusual. Former president Barack Obama still occasionally shares reading lists on his Facebook page. During his second term, George W. Bush competed with Karl Rove to see who could polish off the most books each year. As president, Trump regularly plugs hagiographies about himself on Twitter, but there's no indication he's read them.
Trump's dearth of historical knowledge has almost certainly played a role in the biggest miscalculations of his administration, especially the fateful decision to launch a trade war against China that he promised the American people would be quick and easy to win.
The Marine Corps maintains a list of required reading for each rank. Mattis, who was assisted in writing the book by Marine veteran Bing West, said this common core curriculum proved critical as he rose in the ranks because he could comfortably cite specific examples of how fighting forces had faced similar challenges in previous eras, knowing that his troops would understand what he was referencing.
The book showcases a multitude of moments that an institutional insistence on studying history paid off for Mattis and his Marines. In spring 2002, Mattis was promoted to a two-star general. He took command of the 1st Marine Division and was ordered to prepare to go to war in Iraq. Mattis writes that the idea of invading Iraq "stunned" him. "Even assuming he had chemical weapons, I believed we had him boxed in with our daily combat air patrols and sanctions against his oil exports," he volunteers. "Having served 20 years in the region, I knew that [Saddam Hussein's] hatred of Iran worked to our strategic advantage."
But, Mattis said, his commanding officer told him that his job was to get 22,000 troops ready for combat, regardless of whether he thought it was a good idea. That night, he remembers, "I dumped my gear in my quarters, pulled books off the shelves and began studying campaigns in Mesopotamia, starting with Xenophon's 'Anabasis' and books on Alexander the Great - working my way forward."
After the invasion, Mattis's headquarters wound up being only 500 meters from where Alexander the Great laid in state in Babylon. He laments in the book that much of the trouble that followed in the occupation would have been foreseeable, and even avoidable, if political decision-makers had studied the British occupation of Iraq after World War I and the French battle for Algiers in 1956 the way that he had.
In contrast, the president prefers visuals over written text when it comes to briefings on the hard issues that reach the Resolute Desk. The New York Times reported in 2017 that National Security Council staffers were told to keep briefing papers for Trump to a single page, with bullet points and graphics. Reuters reported that the president's daily briefers strategically placed Trump's name in as many paragraphs as possible in a gambit to hold his attention.
"I like bullets, or I like as little as possible," Trump told Axios in 2017. "I don't need, you know, 200-page reports on something that can be handled on a page."
Mattis makes clear in his book that Afghanistan cannot be handled on a page. Nor can Iraq. Or NATO. He decries the deceptive simplicity of PowerPoint, which he calls "the scourge of critical thinking."
"It encourages fragmented logic by the briefer and passivity in the listener," Mattis writes, adding that "it makes us stupid."

There will still be an election in the UK, and Brexit will still happen

Texto completo: Life in Britain is pretty great right now. It’s the loveliest time of year: The rankness of high summer has passed, but the hedgerows remain thick and green, flecked with the first hints of autumn color. We are gripped by one of the most dramatic Ashes series ever: our regular cricket clash with Australia. Employment is at record levels. The deficit has finally been eliminated. The governing Conservative Party is 10 points ahead in the opinion polls.
I feel I have to lay these things out for overseas audiences, because a casual glance at the headlines might give you the impression that the United Kingdom is in the throes of some terrible crisis. The New York Times and the Washington Post, in particular, now run hilarious articles on an almost daily basis about how dreadful everything suddenly is “because of Brexit.”
Yes, there is a crisis in Parliament, but, outside Westminster, things are ticking along very nicely. In the three years since the referendum, Britain has attracted more foreign investment than any country in the world except China. Our stock exchange is surging. There are more EU nationals working in the U.K. than ever, belying the NYT’s idiotic claims of a faltering economy, let alone rising xenophobia.
What of the shenanigans at Westminster? Well, one thing that I can state definitively is that they are not a “Brexit crisis." Brexit, as you must have noticed, has not happened. What we are seeing is the opposite of a Brexit crisis, an “un-Brexit crisis," a crisis caused by the refusal of MPs to do what they promised to do when they last stood for election.
As I write, the Opposition parties are seeking to overturn the referendum result. They don’t exactly phrase it like that, of course. Instead, they say that they don’t want to leave without a deal. But they know perfectly well that, if you rule out a “no-deal Brexit," you rule out Brexit itself. If "no-deal" is off the table, then all Brussels has to do to keep Britain in the EU is continue to offer intolerable terms.
On Wednesday afternoon, MPs passed a motion obliging the government to seek as many extensions as the EU wanted. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, responded by calling for a general election. Whereupon Labour, which has been demanding an immediate poll for two years, suddenly went cold on the idea. Under legislation passed in 2010, two thirds of MPs must agree to an early dissolution of Parliament. On Wednesday evening, Labour and the other opposition parties, looking at the opinion polls, voted against such a dissolution.
Yes, you read that correctly. The parties that have spent the past month accusing Johnson of mounting some sort of coup just voted to prevent him from subjecting his tenure to a national vote.
The House of Commons has thus put itself in a ridiculous position. Pro-EU MPs have voted to keep in office a government they have calculatedly undermined. They have done so for the sole purpose of overturning a referendum result which they had previously promised to uphold. That, my friends, is our political crisis in a nutshell.
Now the good news. Voters are not idiots. They can see what is going on. Sooner or later, probably sooner, there will have to be a general election. The Conservatives have, in effect, deselected 21 of their MPs, including several former ministers, for voting with Labour to prevent Brexit. Although that purge has horrified commentators, most of whom are in awe of the Europhile grandees, it is a necessary prelude to an election campaign that will turn on Brexit. The Tories could hardly fight an election promising to leave the EU while several of their candidates refused to accept that policy. Though the pundits are fainting like affronted matrons, voters appreciate Boris Johnson’s strength of purpose.
In the meantime, the loss of those 21 votes has deprived the government of its majority, making an election before the end of the year almost inevitable.
No one can say how it will turn out, obviously, though the betting markets and the money markets are both predicting a Conservative majority. Such a majority would at last allow Britain to square up to the EU without being undermined.
When British MPs defy public opinion, they often quote Edmund Burke’s 1774 speech to the voters of Bristol, in which he explained that he was their representative, not their delegate. The MPs rarely go on to mention that Bristol booted Burke out at the next election.
My guess is that something similar will happen when polling day comes. Even many remain voters balk at the idea of dragging the argument out any further. I’m going to stick my neck out here: Boris is going to win.

Texto completo: Jeff Gordinier used to write profiles of chefs for The New York Times.
His professional gig was great, but his personal life was grim due to a divorce, he said during a telephone interview from California.
Then in 2014, he met Rene Redzepi, the charismatic chef who created Noma, an internationally famous restaurant in Copenhagen. Redzepi was burnt out; his Denmark restaurant had suffered from bad publicity after an outbreak of norovirus sickened diners.
For this duo, the antidote to adversity turned out to be tasting and traveling.
Mr. Gordinier, the food and drinks editor for Esquire magazine, is the author of "Hungry: Eating, Road-Tripping and Risking It All With the Greatest Chef in the World" (Crown/Duggan, $26).
He will recount his adventures and sign copies of the book Thursday at 7 p.m. in Oakland's Carnegie Library Lecture Hall as part of the Pittsburgh Arts&Lectures series. On stage with him will be Pittsburgh chef and James Beard award winner Sonja Finn and Dan Gigler, a food and features writer for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Mr. Redzepi is "constantly on the run, talking about the state of the world, ingredients and cooking and gossip," Mr. Gordinier said.
In their first face-to-face conversation, Mr. Redzepi talked rapturously of tacos and Mexico. Mr. Gordinier thought to himself, "You, Mr. Denmark, are going to lecture me about tacos?"
"At that point, I didn't understand the depth of his love affair with Mexico. I didn't know he spent several weeks every year in Mexico. ... I love Mexican food. I grew up in Los Angeles. His pitch to me was, 'We can travel through Mexico and eat a lot of great food.'"
Their first trip together was the beginning of a sensory education and a beautiful friendship. Emails and texts led to a fishing trip in February above the Arctic Circle, a long journey to Sydney, Australia, and a visit to the Bronx to meet pastry chef Malcolm Livingston II.
Readers have told Mr. Gordinier that the book resonates with them because both men kept pushing forward despite setbacks.
"These adventures just started unspooling," he said. "I just started saying yes to everything. If I didn't chronicle it, no one else would."
Tickets, priced at $10 each, are available by calling 412-622-8866 or at pittsburghlectures.org.

Texto completo: President Trump’s allies are trying to raise two million dollars to fund an effort to find damaging information on journalists.
The fundraising effort was detailed in a three-page pitch seen by Axios.
Trump’s allies intend to target reporters and editors at the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, BuzzFeed, HuffPost, and other news outlets it claims “routinely incorporate bias and misinformation in to their coverage.”
The group said it would give the damaging information it finds on journalists to their colleagues at “friendly media outlets.”
Arthur Schwartz, a conservative consultant who is close with Donald Trump Jr., is involved in raising the funds.
Last month, the New York Times reported on the effort after it had exposed past anti-Semitic tweets from an editor at the newspaper. The pro-Trump network is now using the exposure to help fund their operation, joking that their slogan should be: “Brought to you by The New York Times.”
The effort is similar to how Media Matters, a liberal nonprofit, tracks journalists and publications for bias.

New shows stand out in crowded field

Texto completo: TV is about to become bigger this fall. A whole lot bigger. In addition to the usual crop of new shows from broadcast networks, cable channels and streaming services, two new players will jump into the game in fall 2019: Apple TV+ and Disney+. Disney will unveil "The Mandalorian," the first live-action TV series in the "Star Wars" franchise, with the service's Nov. 12 launch. Apple, which has not announced a debut date, is betting on star power, including Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell in drama "The Morning Show." And some old favorites will return, including the long-awaited third season of Netflix's "The Crown" ( Nov. 17), with Oscar-winner Olivia Colman stepping in the role of Queen Elizabeth II. ABC's long-running family sitcom "Modern Family" (Sept. 25) also is coming back for one last season. To help you sort through this fall's avalanche of television, we chose the 10 most exciting new series.
'Undone'
Amazon Prime (Sept. 13)
"BoJack Horseman" creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg joins forces with Kate Purdy ("Cougar Town") for this adult animated series that embraces darkness. "Undone" is a magical realist drama about Alma (Rose Salazar), a directionless woman in her late 20s who survives a terrible car accident and discovers she has an ability to move through time and communicate with her dead father. The series touches on themes of family history and self-destruction and uses its animation to beautifully and eerily render realistic sketches of its talented cast, which includes Bob Odenkirk as Alma's father. The result is a series that deliberately lives in the uncanny valley, much like its protagonist.
'Country Music'
PBS (Sept. 15, Sundays at 8 EDT/PDT; times may vary)
Because a Ken Burns documentary is almost always a gripping, informative and gorgeously scored examination of American history, it's natural for the celebrated filmmaker to point his lens at country music, a uniquely American cultural phenomenon. The 18-hour, comprehensive look at the genre's rise is not just for diehard fans. It looks at the influences of African instruments and rhythm and blues, among others, includes interviews with dozens of artists and historians, and features an excellent soundtrack.
'Stumptown'
ABC, Sept. 25 (Wednesdays at 10 EDT/PDT)
Cobie Smulders ("How I Met Your Mother") returns to TV with the butt-kicking moves she learned from her Marvel films ( "The Avengers"). Except Dex, her damaged private investigator character on "Stumptown," drinks and gambles far more than S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria ever would. Based on a graphic novel, "Stumptown" which also stars Jake Johnson, follows Dex as she solves (and sometimes mildly commits) crimes and other cases in Portland, Oregon, while she takes care of her younger brother (Cole Sibus), who has Down syndrome, and tries not to gamble her way into poverty. The pilot episode deftly mixes action, drama and comedy, and Smulders remains the magnetic leading lady she was for nine years on "Mother."
'The Unicorn'
CBS, Sept. 26 (Thursdays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
This new comedy is not about mythical horse creatures, but rather Walton Goggins' Wade, a widower who's reluctantly re-entering the dating pool as a rare middle-aged "unicorn" because he's not divorced or a cheating husband, has his own loving family and is earnest. It's a great setup for a great romantic comedy, and has a stellar cast, including Rob Corddry and Michaela Watkins, along with the adorable Goggins, who can make almost anything funny.
'The Politician'
Netflix (Sept. 27)
Prolific creator Ryan Murphy's first Netflix series preserves his stylish flair. "The Politician" stars Ben Platt ("Pitch Perfect," "Dear Evan Hansen") as a pathologically driven high school student who is convinced he will become president of the United States. The first step on his journey is president of his senior class, and he will do anything to win. Co-starring Gwyneth Paltrow as Platt's mother, "Politician" is more akin to early seasons of "Glee" than recent seasons of "American Horror Story;" "Politician" has just the right amount of surrealism and melodrama without going over the edge, at least in early episodes.
'Back to Life'
Showtime, (Oct. 6, Sundays at 8:30 EDT/PDT)
Fans of dark British comedies "Fleabag" and "Catastrophe" will be drawn to this new series created by and starring Daisy Haggard ("Episodes"). The understated but affecting series follows Miri, a middle-aged woman who returns to her parents' house after 18 years in prison. "Life" is awkward, sweet, sad and witty, and wisely takes its time to unfurl Miri's past, initially withholding the reason she was sent to prison.
'Living With Yourself'
Netflix (Oct. 18)
In this comedy from "Daily Show" writer Timothy Greenberg, the great Paul Rudd stars as Miles, a depressed, struggling and unmotivated man who can't even seek fertility doctors. He seeks out an unconventional treatment for his malaise at a strip mall spa and receives much more than he bargained for. Without spoiling the first episode's major twist, let's just say the riotously smart series gives you a double dose of Rudd.
'Modern Love'
Amazon (Oct. 18)
This effervescent romance, based on the New York Times column, is as sweet as apple pie without becoming sickly. "Love" is structured as an anthology series. That could mean a relationship between an overprotective doorman and an apartment resident or someone with bipolar disorder worried about revealing it to their new flame. The joyful series stars Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, John Slattery, Dev Patel and Cristin Millioti.
'High School Musical: The Musical: The Series'
Disney+ (Nov. 12)
An extension of Disney Channel's "High School Musical" franchise, this mockumentary chronicles students' efforts to put on a production of the musical. The tongue-in-cheek approach offers enough new and old music to satisfy fans but creates modern new characters to anchor the stories. Aimed at teens (or nostalgic millennials) instead of Disney Channel's kid and tween audience, "High School" is self-aware and self-effacing. It does almost everything right that NBC's ill-fated "Rise" did wrong, and genuinelyis funny. "The Mandalorian" (which was unavailable to preview) will get much of the attention when Disney+ launches, but don't write off this sitcom as just for kids.
'His Dark Materials'
HBO (expected in November)
The world of Phillip Pullman's classic fantasy trilogy comes to life in far more detail (and with better writing) than the failed 2007 film "The Golden Compass." With each planned season based on one of Pullman's novels, "Materials" (already renewed for a second) gives more depth to the story of Lyra (Dafne Keen), the bright young girl living in a world slightly different than our own (human souls live outside their bodies in animals called "daemons"). Co-starring Lin-Manuel Miranda, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson, the steampunk-style fantasy world might satisfy HBO viewers who miss the high fantasy that "Game of Thrones" brought them for so long.

Texto completo: Our series "How I became a …" digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings starting an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage that turned into the booming fashion retailer Nasty Gal to writing New York Times
bestseller #GIRLBOSS and founding the digital media brand and community Girlboss, Sophia Amoruso has been at the forefront of brand-building in the digital age.
Question: How did you get your start in the business world?
Sophia Amoruso: At 22, I started an eBay store called Nasty Gal Vintage, and it exploded. In a few years, we went from $250,000 to $1.1 million to $6.5 million to $30 million in revenue.
Q: What does a typical workday look like for you?
Amoruso: I usually take calls from home in the morning, and come in around 10. I have a lot of meetings, more than I would like, but there's a lot to do. I go home at maybe 7, and for the most part I cook dinner for myself – I enjoy cooking – and I'll often work from home for several hours after that, just catching up.
Q: What's your favorite thing about your job?
Amoruso: Being able to learn. Our platform is in beta, but I'm beta, and I'll always be beta. I get to learn things that I would never otherwise be able to and that I never even knew existed. Just learning, really every day – it's such a privilege to be in a place where our business requires that.
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Amoruso: Resourcefulness, grit and curiosity.
Q: What have been some of your career highlights?
Amoruso: The cover of Forbes was huge; publishing "#GIRLBOSS" was an unparalleled experience; opening our first store with Nasty Gal was so exciting, and founding Girlboss.
Q: What has been one of the biggest tough lessons you've had to learn as an entrepreneur?
Amoruso: Holding executives accountable. That's something I could have done a better job of at Nasty Gal. I hire people, and I trust them. The advice is to let smart people do their jobs, but at the same time, everybody needs that kind of guidance.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Amoruso: Try a lot of things and find what you're good at. Especially when you're young, you cannot fail. You have all the permission to jump around and try different things. Find smart people around you who have been there and done it. Seek out great advice, and stay curious.

Texto completo: The new report from the Justice Department inspector general proves beyond any doubt that fired FBI Director James Comey leaked sensitive law enforcement material in the Trump-Russia investigation. Doing so set a "dangerous example" for the bureau's other employees, Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote.
Still, Comey's supporters have claimed exoneration on one front: that Comey did not leak classified information. Some reacted angrily when President Trump tweeted that Comey had done so.
But Comey did, in fact, leak classified information. It's right there in the report. It wasn't much classified information, and it was perhaps not terribly important, and Justice Department officials concluded it was not worth prosecuting. But Comey leaked classified material.
Comey implicitly recognized as much even as he claimed vindication. In a tweet, Comey quoted the report, saying: "DOJ IG 'found no evidence that Comey or his attorneys released any of the classified information contained in any of the memos to members of the media.'" To that, Comey added, "I don't need a public apology from those who defamed me, but a quick message with a 'sorry we lied about you' would be nice."
But the portion of the report Comey highlighted said he did not release classified information to members of the media. That's true; Comey, through his friend and lawyer Daniel Richman, leaked sensitive but unclassified law enforcement material to the media. But it's also true that Comey leaked classified information to his lawyers. Comey gave classified information to people who were not authorized to receive it.
Comey wrote seven memos about his interactions with Trump. In June 2017, the month after Comey was fired, the FBI checked the memos to see if any contained classified information. From the report: "The FBI determined that Memos 1 and 3 contained information classified at the 'SECRET' level, and that Memos 2 and 7 contained small amounts of information classified at the 'CONFIDENTIAL' level. The FBI designated Memos 4, 5, and 6 as unclassified 'For Official Use Only.'"
Memo 4 was the one Comey leaked, through Richman, to the New York Times with the hope of setting off a firestorm that would result in the appointment of a special counsel. The inspector general concluded the leak violated Justice Department and FBI policy, as well as Comey's terms of employment. But it had no classified material in it.
The problem for Comey was Memo 2, which he sent to Richman and to Comey's two other lawyers, Patrick Fitzgerald and David Kelley. Of the memos Comey shared with his attorneys, Memo 2 contained six words that the FBI determined in June 2017 to be classified at the 'CONFIDENTIAL' level," the inspector general report said. In a footnote, the report added: "Four of the six words in Memo 2 that the FBI determined were classified were the names of foreign countries being discussed by the president....The president referenced the countries when he conveyed his personal views on the relative importance of promptly returning telephone calls from the leadership of the named countries."
Comey, who as director was something known as an OCA, or Original Classification Authority, had the power to classify material on his own. He did not classify Memo 2 at the time he wrote it, but an FBI team later determined it should be classified. When the document was released to the public, portions were blacked out to reflect that classification.
Another indication of the material's status as classified was that the the FBI took extensive steps to remove it from the computers and devices of the three lawyers, Richman, Fitzgerald, and Kelley, who received it. After top bureau officials determined that there was classified material in what Comey had sent, in June 2017 the FBI dispatched agents to Richman's home to take away his desktop computer. Nine days later, they returned the computer "after taking steps to permanently remove the memos from it," the report said.
In later months, FBI agents "met with the individuals and IT professionals associated with [Fitzgerald's and Kelley's] accounts, and confirmed that the emails and copies of the memos were deleted from the computer systems that had received them."
It was a lot of work. "The FBI wouldn't have wasted time deleting copies of Memo 2 from Comey's lawyers' email accounts if it didn't contain classified information," a source familiar with the interactions between the FBI, the inspector general's office, and oversight committees on the Hill about the classified clean-up efforts told me. "There is no doubt Comey leaked that classified memo to his counsel, and oversight committees have known about the clean-up operation since it first occurred."
Comey's defenders can argue that just a few words on Memo 2 were classified. They can argue, as Comey apparently believes, that even those words should not have been classified. But the fact is, they were classified, and Comey sent them to unauthorized recipients, and after the FBI learned about it, the bureau took steps to clean up what it called a "spill" of classified material.
So it's true that Comey did not leak classified information to members of the media. But he still leaked classified information. The Justice Department decided that given the small amount of classified material involved, and given that it was formally classified after Comey sent it, and given the difference of opinion on whether it should be classified at all, prosecuting Comey was not warranted.
Finally, there is no doubt that Comey's leak of sensitive law enforcement material was far more serious, and far more consequential, than his leak of classified information. That was the inspector general's focus when he wrote that "by not safeguarding sensitive information obtained during the course of his FBI employment, and by using it to create public pressure for official action, Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information." Comey's rationale — that he was compelled to leak sensitive law enforcement information because he loved his country and loved the FBI — was not sufficient, the inspector general said. "Comey's closest advisers used the words 'surprised,' 'stunned,' 'shocked,' and 'disappointment' to describe their reactions to learning what Comey had done," the report noted.
Surprised, stunned, shocked. Comey's FBI colleagues did not utter those words because they heard Comey had been exonerated. They uttered them when they heard the full extent of what Comey did, and that included leaking classified information.

Texto completo: This great country took Omar, a Somali refugee from a Kenyan refugee camp, granted her citizenship, and sent her to the hallowed halls of Congress. All we ask for, is a little gratitude. Apparently, that is too much to ask.
Recently, Israel barred congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering the country citing their support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, one which even the Democrat-controlled U.S. Congress voted down in bipartisan fashion by a margin of 398-17.
A few days later, Israel granted a humanitarian exception to Tlaib and allowed entry so she could visit her grandmother.
Tlaib declined the offer and instead held a press conference where she shed tears and falsely claimed that Israel barred her from visiting her grandmother.
She promptly followed up her tear-filled claim with a fundraising letter.
Omar and Tlaib have constantly hidden behind their skin color, national origin, religion and gender while refusing to accept responsibility for their poor judgment, irresponsible remarks and questionable alliances.
This time Omar and Tlaib attempted to hide behind their special status as members of Congress.
They could have easily visited Israel with 41 of their Democrat colleagues led by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, who took the trip earlier this month.
Instead, they opted for a trip sponsored by Miftah, a pro-Palestinian group that supports suicide bombers and spreads false claims that Jews used the blood of Christians in the Jewish Passover, according to New York Times columnist Bari Weiss.
The congresswomen's official agenda called it a "U.S. Congressional Delegation to Palestine". Tlaib has a world map in her office with a Post-it "Palestine" that has an arrow pointing to Israel on the map.
Anti-American remarks and actions by Omar and Tlaib are innumerous. In 2017, Omar took a trip to Honduras sponsored by the pro-communist, anti-American group Witness for Peace. She subscribes to the Marxist view of the Cold War, which makes America the villain. Then there is Omar's reference to the attacks of 9/11 as "some people did something." Neither Omar nor Tlaib have condemned the terrorist organization Hamas or those in the Middle East who burn American flags and chant "Death to America." Just this month, Tlaib spoke to reporters where she said, "My city [of Beit Ur al-Fauqa] is so excited." She tweeted about "my love for my city" referring to a city in the Middle East. I thought she was from Michigan ...
One final point: In 2016, I was invited to meet with a delegation of Israeli parliamentary staffers.
During the conversation, I started responding to one of their questions with, "America is the greatest country in the world ..." when I realized that my audience may feel that their country, Israel, is just as great.
I tried to be mindful to their sensitivities, so I continued with, "I recognize you may feel that Israel ..." but I never had the chance to finish my sentence.
"Sam, we love Israel but America is the greatest country in the world", said one of the members of the delegation. Somehow, America's greatness, acknowledged by many around the world, seems to have eluded Omar and Tlaib, and their allies.
The protestors in Hong Kong, all of whom are Chinese citizens, waved the American flag and sang our national anthem many times during their recent protest. America is, and has been, the beacon of freedom in the modern world, yet, these two congresswomen somehow have a tough time acknowledging it.
This great country took Omar, a Somali refugee from a Kenyan refugee camp, granted her citizenship, and sent her to the hallowed halls of Congress.
All we ask for, is a little gratitude.
Apparently, that is too much to ask.

Texto completo: The promo for tonight's local news runs across your screen: "Two of the items in your pantry right now could kill you. Tune in at 11 to find out which ones."
After hearing this announcement, you can't not tune in.
When you learn about a hot tech company that offers unlimited days off, tuition reimbursement, cool offices and a change-the-world mission, you can't not apply for the job.
The new all-natural, great tasting, calorie-free, reasonably priced, time-saving meal kit is exactly what you've been looking for. You can't not buy it. In our business lives, we're constantly striving to persuade. The desired action we seek could be to watch a TV show, apply for a job, or buy a product. It could be to hire a certain law firm, reduce carbon emissions, or save for retirement. To a degree, our professional accomplishments are directly tied to our ability to effectively move others to specific actions. So what can we do to boost results? How can we stand out from the competitive set, becoming irresistible?
In every act of persuasion, a value proposition is offered up.
For example, if you're trying to get a job promotion, your proposed value is that you'll work hard, effectively lead the team, and your extensive industry experience will help you make smart decisions. Whether you're pitching in-home health care services or industrial bolts, your odds of persuasion skyrocket if you creatively present your wares such that the other party can't not buy.
If your product or service can easily be procured by another supplier, the main decision factor is price. But if you are serving up something that's unique and compelling, you enter the rarified territory of can't-not. To get there, we must think creatively on what we're offering that others don't or won't.
The primary factors that drive irresistibility include scarcity (is what you offer limited?), status (do you offer something that elevates the way others feel?), efficacy (does your offering effectively do the job better than alternatives?), and presentation (is the story and packaging alluring?).
Take your current pitch — which could be any desired action you're hoping to drive — and examine it along these four elements. If you haven't yet reached can't-not status, take another creative pass to boost your irresistibility factor.
Reaching can't-not isn't about manipulation. Rather, it is a deliberate approach to your value proposition that makes your offer so much better than the alternatives that going with you is a no brainer. If you sell life insurance, make sure your prospects can't not select you as their provider. If you're trying to raise investment capital for your startup, what makes you a can't-not choice?
Shoot for the can't-not, and you'll simply end up selling, persuading and achieving more.
C'mon ... you can't not want to.

'Absolute no' does not mean 'maybe'

Texto completo: "I feel the ballot is my term limits," I'll say while holding both hands up to my chest and clasping imaginary lapels in an haphazard effort to look more scholarly.
From the dome to your home. Ramblings, mutterings, keen observations and things you ought to know out of Helena from the mind of Phil Drake.
AN ABSOLUTE NO: If you follow the news you know by now that Gov. Steve Bullock did not qualify to be in the Sept. 12 Democratic presidential candidates' debate.
Political observers long before last Wednesday's deadline said he was struggling to get the needed numbers.
But the Bullock campaign is moving forward with him announcing minutes after learning he did not qualify that he will watch the debates with Iowans. He continues to work the state prior to its caucus, which is about 145 days away.
Several candidates have dropped out, bringing the field down to 20.
Did you catch his Aug. 25 town hall meeting on CNN? Well, I did. So much of what he said I had heard before, but there were some new things – at least new to me.
He talked about the economy and rising fears of a recession.
"At the end of the day, from my perspective, the economy is really about 300 million people making decisions each and every day around their kitchen table," he said.
Bullock said if a recession does occur by 2020, a president would need to address challenges along the way such as getting back to local stability, getting off Twitter before adding that big things need to be done. He noted that it's crazy not to be able to get a meaningful infrastructure bill through.
And again he pooh-poohed (a phrase that only the most talented of writers use) suggestions that he run for Senate.
"That is an 'Absolute no,'" Bullock said at the prodding of CNN host Alisyn Camerota, who posed the question.
Then he said something that I reported, but did not pick up on, but that someone else noted to me the next day.
One of the reasons he gave was that as a senator he would only be able to see his children on weekends.
The person I was chatting with, a Republican, said that was the first time he had heard that given as a reason. But I must admit, I think that would have been one of the things that would have drawn my parents to the job.
The Republican I was chatting with, and another standing nearby, both believe he will run for Senate. I keep thinking he digs himself in deeper and deeper with each denial. But I also know that folks are very forgiving when it comes to that kind of stuff.
Stay tuned.
IZZAT SO?: (A phrase my grandma used to say) Speaking of the GOP, I got an email from the Montana Republican Party seeking some donations. It's not unusual as I have been getting emails from everyone asking the same thing, including a Nigerian prince who I recently loaned $10,000 in the hopes of getting $1M back.
State GOP president Don Kaltschmidt, who goes by "Don K," says "We've personally been told that Montana is the number one target seat in the entire nation to flip Republican in the Governor's race."
"Thanks to supporters like you, we're building our plan for victory and making historic investments right now to put our candidates in the strongest position to win next year," he wrote.
I think the primary season will be very brutal for the Republicans. Rep. Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Tim Fox and state Sen. Al Olszewski have already started to tangle.
I was talking with one high-ranking Republican who said he felt like a heartbroken father to see his sons fighting.
Democrats in the race include Lt. Gov. Mike Cooney, state Rep. Casey Schreiner and former state Rep. Reilly Neill.
HITTING THE LIMITS: Republican Matt Rosendale, who is running for the U.S. House of Representatives vacated by fellow Republican Greg Gianforte, said recently he has signed a term-limit pledge.
I've never been enamored with the term-limit debate.
"I feel the ballot is my term limits," I'll say while holding both hands up to my chest and clasping imaginary lapels in an haphazard effort to look more scholarly.
U.S. Term Limits, which describes itself as a "nonpartisan national movement to limit terms for elected officials," put out a news release Tuesday praising Rosendale for signing their pledge.
"I will cosponsor and vote for the U.S. Term Limits amendment of three (3) House terms and two (2) Senate terms and no longer limit," the pledge says in part.
The group states congressional term limits is the one bipartisan issue supported by President Donald Trump and former President Barack Obama.
I can't help but think that is the real story.
You can read his pledge here: http://bit.ly/2PnDwMh
Others in the House race include Republicans Corey Stapleton, Joe Dooling and Timothy Johnson. Democrats in the running include Kathleen Williams, Thomas Winter and Matthew Rains.
I SCREWED UP: I attended an event regarding the F-35 recently and its impact on Montana.
It was a fairly glowing story and I had Googled the F-35 before attending. But I got an online spanking from a Cut Bank reader the next morning.
"Gee Phil, you could have mentioned one or two of these issues," he wrote.
He's absolutely right. However, I did not see an Aug. 21 article in the New York Times by Valerie Insinna, the air warfare reporter for Defense News, that the plane "still faced at least 13 severe technical deficiencies during operational testing, including spikes in cabin pressure, some rare instances of structural damage at supersonic speeds and unpredictability while conducting extreme maneuvers."
Officials at the Montana event touted its capabilities as a fighter jet and its economic value to the state through contractors who participate in the program. In Montana, the F-35 brings 190 direct and indirect jobs and has a $16 million impact on the state's economy, officials said.

SAD NEWS: I got a call Wednesday that a former boss of mine in Southern California had died. Steve Hunt was 64. That's too darn young. Heck 100 would have been too soon for Steve to check out.
He was skinny as a rail, kind, a dedicated journalist, talented songwriter and always the hardest-working person in the room. He was the managing editor, and I was the city editor, the best job you can have in a newsroom.
He was the kind Tom Hanks character in "Saving Private Ryan," and I was the crazed Tom Sizemore character from the same movie. I would have fired me if I were him. But I think I always got the job done, even though it wasn't pretty.
I am having trouble coming to grips as to why he is gone and I am still here. Don't get me wrong, I griped about some of the stuff he did, but now that he is gone I can see how petty I was.
I wrote a column in California at his urging in which I often referred to myself as "the self-anointed king of the San Gabriel Valley." I really think I got the column because I ticked him off by sitting in the back of the room during staff meetings and muttering something to the person next to me, causing them to laugh.
He told me to put my comedic skills to good use and make the column funny. He believed people needed a reason to laugh on a Sunday morning. I think he was right, but didn't know if I was the guy to do it. The column was somewhat/not somewhat popular. But it gave me a chance to vent and have fun.
He even thought of starting an advertising campaign with my ugly mug on billboards and buses plastered with "Get your Phil." Thankfully, that never came to fruition. I probably would have thrown myself in front of the bus to stop the torture of innocent citizens.
We talked rarely after I left Southern California, which was 99% my fault. My self-loathing keeps me from keeping in touch with folks as much as I should.
And now he's gone. The world has lost a great newsman, and I've lost a great friend.

Texto completo: ThinkFoodGroup, the Washington-based parent company that oversees Mercado Little Spain in New York City, said this week that it had discovered a payroll glitch that underpaid some employees at the gigantic Hudson Yards food hall and market. The affected workers will receive back wages, plus another check of equal size to "offset any difficulties," ThinkFoodGroup founder Jose Andres said in a statement released Wednesday.
The announcement came two days after a bartender at Mercado Little Spain had sued Andres and Hudson Hall LLC, the company behind the sprawling Hudson Yards project, claiming that the superstar chef and restaurateur's debut in New York has violated state and federal wage laws.
"This week, we found a glitch in how we paid some wages in NYC - some underpaid, more overpaid. I apologize to everyone who was underpaid. We're correcting it today," Andres tweeted on Wednesday.
"Well, look at that," said lawyer D. Maimon Kirschenbaum, upon learning about Andres's pledge from a reporter. "An American hero." (Last year, the chef and restaurateur was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work feeding victims of natural disasters.)
Kirschenbaum apologized for his flippant remark, but said that as attorney for Tina Braunstein, the bartender who filed the initial class-action complaint on Monday, he will continue with his case against Andres and Hudson Hall.
"There is no way they would try to settle it without my intervention unless they were trying to save money," Kirschenbaum said. He said that Andres and ThinkFoodGroup are trying to avoid the potentially heavy fines that can accompany such wage-violation cases. Kirschenbaum said a company must pay $250 a day, per employee, for each day there is inaccurate information recorded on a worker's pay stub. There is a $5,000 cap per employee.
Andres, the lawyer said, is "hoping for some sort of mulligan on whatever penalties he might owe."
ThinkFoodGroup declined to respond to Kirschenbaum's allegations about avoiding fines. The company did issue this statement from Eduardo Sanabia, chief people officer for ThinkFoodGroup:
"Following an allegation that Mercado Little Spain may have underpaid certain employees with respect to certain rates of pay, we immediately conducted an accounting and pay audit and discovered a glitch in our payroll software that caused both underpayment of some employees and overpayment of others. While the total amounts underpaid are very small and do not affect every employee, we take an error like this very seriously and intend to rectify it immediately. We're working with the software company to fix the error, and employees who were underpaid will receive back payment and wages owed this week. In fact, Chef Jose has directed that any employee who had the wrong rate used to their detriment will receive a second payment in an equal amount in an effort to offset any difficulties. Moreover, employees who were in fact overpaid will be able to keep the extra wages."
Braunstein was hired in April to work as a bartender at various sites at the sprawling Mercado Little Spain, which had opened in March at Hudson Yards. In her complaint, Braunstein alleges that she was paid the tipped minimum wage for work that, according to New York law, requires employers to pay the full minimum wage.
She also alleges that Mercado Little Spain did not pay her the proper overtime wage of $17.50 per hour and did not pay her the correct $15 premium, as required by New York state law, when she worked more than 10 hours in a day. Furthermore, Braunstein alleges that pooled tips were improperly shared with non-service workers, such as barbacks, in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The plaintiffs in the case increased by one on Thursday, when former Mercado Little Spain bartender and barback Cindy Martinez was added to an amended complaint. Martinez, the lawsuit alleges, "felt so strongly that defendants were not interested in paying her properly that she resigned her position only days after the formal opening." The number of plaintiffs could rise further. The complaint mentions a potential class of 40 members, but Kirschenbaum said Braunstein claims there could be hundreds of employees who may also be underpaid.
In the amended complaint, Kirschenbaum argues the alleged wage and labor violations cannot be chalked up to software malfunctions. For example, the complaint said, Martinez worked three shifts from 2 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. as a bartender/barback at a Mercado Little Spain space that allegedly did not open until 5 p.m. and closed at "roughly" 11 p.m., requiring her to work at least four hours without the opportunity for tips.
The "blatant minimum wage violation has no relation to any alleged software glitch," the complaint noted. "Rather, defendants saved money by having tipped employees perform non-tipped setup and breakdown work while illegally paying them as though they were receiving tips for that work."
What's more, the amended complaint singles out Andres's opposition to Initiative 77, the ballot measure that would have eliminated the tipped minimum wage in the District. Voters approved the ballot initiative last year, but the D.C. Council later repealed the measure amid pressure from the restaurant industry. Given his past statements on higher minimum wages for tipped employees, the complaint said, "it is quite brazen and unbelievable that he now chalks all underpayments up to a glitch and believes that he should get a free pass by repaying only a small portion of his true liability."
Mercado Little Spain has been generally well-received since its debut. Both Eater New York and the New York Times have given it positive reviews. "I was well into my fifth meal in the complex before I came across a dish I didn't really like; as a general rule, everything is good, which is not something restaurant critics are in the habit of saying," wrote Times critic Pete Wells in a July review.
Kirschenbaum said his niche is representing restaurant workers who accuse employers of wage theft and other labor violations. In 2017, he represented two plaintiffs who accused Sushi Nakazawa, owner Alessandro Borgognone and chef Daisuke Nakazawa of misappropriating tips and not paying workers the minimum wage. (The case has since been settled, Kirschenbaum said.)
The attorney also represented Braunstein as a plaintiff in a case against activist chef Dan Barber and his Blue Hill at Stone Barns, the farm-to-table destination in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., where the farm resides next to the restaurant. Braunstein sued in 2006 for discrimination, harassment and retaliation, a case in which the bartender claimed she was called names and belittled by management after receiving praise in media coverage of Blue Hill, including a 2004 review by Frank Bruni in the New York Times.
According to court documents, the Blue Hill complaint was voluntarily dismissed in early 2010. There was a settlement in the case, reached just ahead of a jury's decision, but the terms were not made public.
Braunstein has been a plaintiff in other cases against restaurants, too, including one against the now-closed Telepan restaurant on the Upper West Side (the case was dismissed) and a still-open discrimination and retaliation complaint against the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
In the Mercado Little Spain action, Braunstein and other potential plaintiffs who join the class action are seeking unpaid wages, liquidated damages, attorneys' fees, and "other legal and equitable relief as this court deems just and proper."
Kirschenbaum said it was standard practice to name an individual - in this case Andres - in this type of lawsuit.
"You never know what's going on with a company's finances," Kirschenbaum said. "Having an individual on the hook is always a good way to make sure a company will make good on their debts."

Texto completo: *Correction appended
A lone gunman with a local address and no apparent connection to terrorism was responsible for the Permian Basin shooting that left eight people dead, including the shooter, according to Odessa Police Chief Michael Gerke. Twenty-two others were injured — including three law enforcement officials and a 17-month-old who was hit in the mouth and chest with shrapnel — in a Saturday afternoon rampage that ended with the gunman's death outside a crowded Odessa movie theater.
“You will notice I am not naming the subject,” Gerke said during a Sunday press conference attended by Gov. Greg Abbott. “I refuse to. I am not going to give him any notoriety for what he did.”
Gerke said authorities would release the alleged shooter’s name, but not during a nationally-televised press conference; the Wall Street Journal, citing law enforcement sources, later identified him as 36-year-old Seth Ator.
The New York Times reported on Sunday night that the shooter had been fired from his trucking job a few hours before his rampage.
According to CNN, Ator was arrested in 2001 for criminal trespass and evading arrest and received deferred adjudication for the misdemeanors. In 2018, he also had a traffic citation. CNN also reported that a neighbor of the suspected gunman, Veronica Alonzo, said he showed up at her home one night last month and threatened her with a rifle for leaving trash in a nearby dumpster. She said he would shoot at targets at night.
Gerke said though they cannot confirm that the shooter's intent was to enter the theater, it begs the question of why he would go there if he did not plan to go inside.
“A Saturday in Odessa, that is one of the most crowded places,” Gerke said.
One of the victims was postal worker Mary Granados, whose van was hijacked by the shooter during the rampage. In a written statement, the U.S. Postal Service said it was “shocked and saddened by the events that occurred yesterday in the Midland-Odessa area. We are especially grieving the loss of our postal family member, letter carrier Mary Granados, age 29, and we continue to keep her family in our thoughts.”
Ector County ISD, located in Odessa, tweeted late Saturday that one of their students died in the shooting.
“We are heartbroken and outraged by the violence that struck our community and our school district today,” the tweet read. “We are learning that we have lost friends, family members, as well as one of our students. Our lives have been changed forever.”
The district didn't name the student, but Gerke said a 15-year-old girl was among the victims. He said the people killed ranged in age from 15 to 57.
“There are no definite answers as to motive or reasons at this point,” said Gerke, who also offered his apologies and condolences to the victims and their families.
It was the second mass shooting in Texas in a month. Saturday’s shooting happened exactly four weeks after a deadly Saturday shooting at an El Paso Walmart — nearly 300 miles west of Midland-Odessa — that left 22 dead and more than two dozen wounded on Aug. 3. The gunman in that shooting was arrested and charged with capital murder.
And just as he’d done after the El Paso shooting, Abbott flew to West Texas and offered words of sympathy and promises to take action to reduce gun violence.
“We know that words alone are inadequate,” Abbott said during Sunday's press conference. “Words must be met with action.”
“I have been to too many of these events,” Abbott added. “I am heartbroken by the crying of the people of the state of Texas. I am tired of the dying of the people of the state of Texas. Too many Texans are in mourning, too many Texans have lost their lives.”
He said that following the May 2018 Santa Fe High School shooting near Houston that left 10 people dead, he signed 15 new laws this year that addressed school safety. He said he’s been working with lawmakers and advocates since the El Paso shooting to draft more legislation that he said will be aimed at both protecting Second Amendment rights and reducing gun violence. The Legislature finished its most recent session in May and doesn’t convene again until January 2021.
Abbott read aloud a text he received from the mother of the 17-month-old girl who was shot and is now hospitalized in Lubbock. The mother wrote that the child will undergo surgery to repair her lip, teeth and tongue and remove shrapnel from her chest. The child’s jaw wasn't struck, the mother wrote.
“This is all our worst nightmare but thank God she is relatively well,” Abbott read. “Toddlers are funny in that they can get shot, but still want to run around and play.”
According to officials, the shooting started just after 3 p.m. in Midland during a traffic stop over a failure to signal.
The Texas Department of Public Safety said that two state troopers pulled over a lone male driver, who then grabbed a rifle, opened fire and wounded an officer. He then began shooting at people with what Gerke described as an “AR-type weapon.” The shooter eventually ditched his car, hijacked Granados’ Postal Service vehicle and continued to open fire as he drove, police said.
The shootings ended next to the theater, where two police officers — one from Odessa and one from Midland — were wounded as they exchanged gunfire with the gunman, who died at the scene.
The trooper is in serious but stable condition and is expected to make a full recovery, and the two police officers are in stable condition at a local hospital, according to DPS. CBS 7 identified the Midland police officer as Zach Owens.
FBI Special Agent Christopher Collins said more than 15 crime scenes were being investigated and a federal search warrant was being executed on Sunday.
At a press conference from Medical Center Hospital in Odessa, CEO Russell Tippin said 13 victims were transported to the hospital and one died after arrival.
“Pray for the victims,” Tippin said. “If you hear my voice, hug your families.”
By Sunday morning, one person remained in critical condition, while another three were in serious condition and seven were in fair condition, according to CBS 7.
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released a statement that he and his wife, Heidi, were heartbroken by the attack and were “lifting up in prayer all the victims, their families, and the entire Midland-Odessa community.”
“We are thankful for the law enforcement officers who heroically risked their lives and acted swiftly to stop the shooter and save others,” Cruz said. “Their courage helped prevent even more senseless deaths, and we honor their tireless commitment to protecting us all. We Texans are standing together tonight united against all forms of hatred and violence.”
Both Texans in the presidential race, Julián Castro and Beto O’Rourke, also released statements.
“Heartbreaking news out of Odessa and Midland, Texas as police search for an active shooter at-large,” Castro tweeted. “Stay indoors and monitor news alerts and safety protocols.”
“Our hearts are with Midland, Odessa, and everyone in West Texas who has to endure this again,” O’Rourke said. “More information is forthcoming, but here's what we know: We need to end this epidemic.”
President Donald Trump tweeted that he had been briefed by Attorney General William Barr about the shootings and the “FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged.”
Correction: A previous version of this story cited a CNN story that reported the gunman was arrested for criminal trespass and burglary. The gunman was actually charged with criminal trespass and evading arrest, the network reported in a later version of its story. Due to an editing error, a previous version of the story also incorrectly stated the location of the movie theater where the gunman was killed. It is in Odessa.

HOW CAN MINNESOTANS HELP THE AMAZON?

Texto completo: Thousands of miles away from Minnesota, rainforests in the Amazon are burning down. But local nonprofits say Minnesotans can help.
More than 26,000 forest fires have been recorded in the Amazon rainforest this month, the highest number in a decade, according to the New York Times. That affects climate change because forests absorb a significant share of the planet's climate-warming carbon dioxide. They are also home to endangered species and indigenous people.
"It's a global issue … it will impact Minnesota," said Tim Schaefer, the state director of Environment Minnesota, an advocacy organization based in Minneapolis. "It's just a really important moment and we want to be part of finding a solution."
Here are some suggestions:
• Donate to a nonprofit
National nonprofits such as the Rainforest Alliance have set up funds to support groups in Brazil working to protect the Amazon.
• Contact elected officials
Schaefer said local residents could put pressure on federal elected officials to boost aid to Brazil. National environmental groups also say consumers should be aware of how their choices affect deforestation.
• Plant a tree
Many local nonprofits organize and fund tree plantings across the state.
Great River Greening, a St. Paul nonprofit, organizes volunteers to plants trees, grasses and flowers and implement conservation practices on agricultural land to decrease erosion throughout the state. Donate or find more details at greatrivergreening.org.
"While we're a long way from the Amazon here in Minnesota, our work to plant native trees, grasses, and wildflowers acts as a carbon sink to mitigate the impacts of climate change," Mary Anne Welch, a spokeswoman for Great River Greening, said. "So a concrete way for folks to make a difference is to commit to stewardship in anyway they can, on their own properties and in larger areas."
At Tree Trust, a St. Paul nonprofit that plants 3,000 trees a year across the metro area, people can volunteer to help plant trees this fall or donate at treetrust.org. "Trees planted anywhere help people everywhere," Tree Trust's Karen Zumach said.

New York Times writer blames ‘the phonies, the charlatans’ for ‘why people hate religion’

Texto completo: New York Times opinion writer Timothy Egan published a scathing rebuke of Evangelical Christians who "give cover to an amoral president" because they believe God is using Trump to promote their causes.
The op-ed, published on Friday, notes how evangelicals allegedly have turned a blind eye toward Trump's rhetoric and appear to be thrilled by Trump's bullying antics.
"There has never been anyone who has defended us and who has fought for us, who we have loved more than Donald J. Trump," conservative activist Ralph Reed said at a gathering of Christian activists earlier this summer.
Egan describes Vice President Mike Pence as wearing "his faith like a fluorescent orange vest," but said that faith turned invisible when he visited the United States' southern border this summer and saw human beings "crammed like cordwood in the Texas heat," lumping him in with "the phonies, the charlatans."
"Pence is the chief bootlicker to a president who now sees himself in messianic terms, a president who tweets a description of himself as 'the second coming of God,'" Egan writes.
He also claims that "millions" of Americans believe in a version of "Jesus Trump, Superstar," a comedic reference to the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar.
Egan sets out to condemn Catholics, as well. He notes the decision of Indianapolis Archbishop Charles C. Thompson to remove a Jesuit high school of its Catholic identity this summer for refusing to fire a gay, married teacher. A similar school in another part of the city was forced to terminate one of its teachers after it was revealed he had married another man.
Thompson's actions are "selective moral policing," according to Egan, which angers good people of faith. He claims that a majority of Catholics support same-sex marriage, saying that Christ does not condemn homosexuality in the Bible.
Egan asserts that "young people are leaving the pews in droves" because religion is too often used as a weapon for loathsome behavior. He indicates people of faith should instead look to the example of a nun who opened up a shelter for migrant children along the U.S.-Mexico border.
"Faith is not that complicated. Religion always is," Egan writes.

Texto completo: Una mujer lanzó este viernes un cóctel molotov en la recepción de una oficina del Servicio de Inmigración y Aduanas (USCIS, por sus siglas en inglés) de Oakland Park, Florida . La bomba casera no funcionó y el incidente quedó en un susto y sin heridos, según Associated Press.
De acuerdo al informe que consultó la citada agencia de noticias, la mujer entró con una botella llena de gasolina y una mecha encendida . Sin embargo, al lanzarla la mecha se soltó y la botella no se encendió.
El personal de seguridad de la oficina esposó a la autora y la detuvo hasta que llegó el Servicio de Protección Federal y la arrestaron.
Las autoridades policiales dijeron que este ataque no está relacionado con otros perpetrados también contra agencias del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS). No obstante, no dijeron el nombre de la mujer ni qué la habría movido a enfrentarse a la institución.
The New York Times informó hace dos semanas de una investigación en proceso sobre unos disparos en una oficina texana del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE).
Estos ataques llegan en un momento de máxima tensión respecto a las restrictivas políticas migratorias que está proponiendo y empleando el presidente Donald Trump.
USCIS en concreto ha estado en el punto de mira en los últimos tiempos porque su director interino Ken Cuccinelli es partidario de las estrictas medidas migratorias del presidente. Bajo su supervisión, USCIS ha encabezado modificaciones como negar tarjetas de residencia a inmigrantes que hayan solicitado beneficios como Medicaid.

Texto completo: President Trump’s personal assistant was reportedly fired after she made critical comments about his daughters to reporters.
Madeleine Westerhout told journalists at an off-the-record dinner that she had a better relationship with the president than his daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, and that the president did not like being photographed with Tiffany because she was seen as being overweight, Politico reported Friday.
Westerhout, 28, also joked that Trump could not pick Tiffany out of a crowd.
The New York Times reported a day earlier that Westerhout, who had been by Trump’s side since his first day in office, abruptly left her position after the president found out she had divulged information about the Trump family to a small group of reporters who were covering Trump’s vacation in Bedminister, New Jersey, earlier this month.
Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley was also at the dinner, but left about an hour in for an interview on Fox News. Westerhout reportedly made the comments after he left.
Trump told reporters before leaving for Camp David for the weekend that he spoke with Westerhout, who told him she had been drinking when she commented on his daughters.
"She called, and I wished her well," Trump said.
The Washington Post’s Phil Rucker, Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs, Reuters’ Steve Holland and Andrew Restuccia of the Wall Street Journal attended the dinner.
“This was an off-the-record dinner and the media blatantly violated that agreement,” an administration official said.
Arthur Schwartz, who is close with Donald Trump Jr., accused Rucker of leaking details from the dinner in a series of tweets Friday. TweetTweet
Steven Ginsberg, an editor for the Washington Post, pushed back on his assertion, saying Rucker “has always acted with the utmost honor and integrity and has never violated Washington Post standards or policies.”

Jordan and Meadows want DOJ inspector general to testify about Comey’s misconduct

Texto completo: House Republicans asked the Democrat-led Oversight Committee on Friday to call Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz to testify about his report on fired FBI Director James Comey’s mishandling of memos of his conversations with Trump.

Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, two well-known Comey critics and Trump defenders on the Committee on Oversight and Reform, sent a letter to Democratic Chairman Elijah Cummings of Maryland asking him to convene a hearing with Horowitz “as soon as possible” to “examine the report about Comey’s misconduct.”

The new 83-page report from Horowitz harshly criticized Comey’s decision to remove his memos from the FBI after he was fired and to provide contents from the memos to a friend to leak to the media. Comey testified to Congress in 2017 that he hoped leaking this information “might prompt the appointment of a special counsel.”
Horowitz concluded that Comey made an “unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information” related to Trump and condemned him for using official FBI records to “achieve a personally desired outcome.”

Jordan and Meadows also pointed out that Horowitz said Comey “set a dangerous example for over 35,000 current FBI employees — and the many thousands more former FBI employees — who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information” and that Comey’s FBI colleagues were “surprised,” “stunned,” “shocked,” and filled with “disappointment” when they learned what he had done.
“The [inspector general] found Comey’s conduct so troubling that it referred the case to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution,” Jordan and Meadows wrote to Cummings. “We can think of no other FBI Director who has been criminally referred for federal prosecution.”
In making their argument, the two Republicans pointed to Cummings’ past words on Comey, calling him “the epitome of what a public servant is all about,” and on Horowitz, saying he “upheld [his] oath and principles for honesty and integrity.”
Jordan and Meadows also wrote that “Comey’s compilation and dissemination of sensitive FBI information had its intended effect — the initiation of a prolonged and expensive special counsel investigation that ultimately failed to substantiate any of the allegations he was appointed to investigate.”
Former special counsel Robert Mueller, appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein the day after a New York Times article based on one of Comey’s memos, concluded that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election but did not establish a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

“In light of the great costs to our country stemming from Comey’s reckless conduct, we respectfully request that you immediately schedule a hearing with Inspector General Horowitz,” Jordan and Meadows said.
Tweet
Beyond the Comey report released on Thursday, Horowitz has also been working on a broader investigation into allegations of abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by the DOJ and the FBI related to the use of British ex-spy Christopher Steele’s dossier, which was compiled at the behest of the Clinton-funded opposition research firm Fusion GPS. That report on the Trump-Russia investigation is expected in September or October.

Timothy Egan: This is why people hate religion

Texto completo: You don’t hear much about Sister Norma Pimentel in the secular press. She’s not a wacko, a hypocrite, a sexual predator or a political operative. Her life’s work, she says, is guided by seeing “the presence of God” in migrant children in the shelter she oversees in the Rio Grande Valley — vulnerable souls that her president would otherwise put in cages.
What you hear about is the phonies, the charlatans who wave Bibles, the theatrically pious, and they are legion. Vice President Mike Pence wears his faith like a fluorescent orange vest. But when he visited the border this summer and saw human beings crammed like cordwood in the Texas heat, that faith was invisible.
“Trump Orders Pence to Find Passage in Bible Where Jesus Tells People to Get the Hell Out.” Though a satirical headline, from the comic writer Andy Borowitz, the above could pass for any day in Trump world.
Pence is the chief bootlicker to a president who now sees himself in messianic terms, a president who tweets a description of himself as “the second coming of God.” As hard as it to see God Part II boasting about grabbing a woman’s genitals, paying hush money to a porn actress, or calling neo-Nazis “very fine people,” millions of overtly religious Americans believe in some version of Jesus Trump, Superstar.
What you hear about are the modern Savonarolas. In Indiana this summer, Archbishop Charles C. Thompson stripped a Jesuit prep school of its Catholic identity for refusing to fire a gay, married teacher. The same threat loomed over another Indianapolis school, until it ousted a beloved teacher with 13 years of service. He was fired for getting married to another man — a legal, civil action.
The archbishop claimed he was upholding Catholic teaching, an example of the kind of selective moral policing that infuriates good people of faith.
Catholic teaching also frowns on divorce. But when a divorced teacher, at the same school where the gay teacher was fired, remarried without a church-sanctioned annulment and posted her status on Facebook as a dare, the archbishop did nothing. For this is a road that leads to thrice-married, politically connected Catholics like Newt Gingrich, whose wife Callista (with whom Gingrich carried on an adulterous affair before getting married) is now Donald Trump’s ambassador to the Vatican.
Thompson says he tries to be “Christ-centered” in his decisions. If so, he should cite words from Christ condemning homosexuality, any words; there are none. That may be one reason a healthy majority of Catholics are in favor of same-sex marriage, despite what their spiritual sentries tell them.
Religious hypocrites are an easy and eternal mark. The French Revolution was driven in part by the revulsion of starving peasants toward the overfed clerics who had taken vows of poverty. The Protestant Reformation took flight on disgust at a church in Rome that sold passages to heaven, enriching men who had multiple mistresses after taking vows of chastity.
White evangelical Christians, the rotting core of Trump’s base, profess to be guided by biblical imperatives. They’re not. Their religion is Play-Doh. They have become more like Trump, not the other way around. It’s a devil’s pact, to use words they would understand.
In one of the most explicit passages of the New Testament, Christ says people will be judged by how they treat the hungry, the poor, the least among us. And yet, only 25 percent of white evangelicals say their country has some responsibility to take in refugees.
Evangelicals give cover to an amoral president because they believe God is using him to advance their causes. “There has never been anyone who has defended us and who has fought for us, who we have loved more than Donald J. Trump,” said Ralph Reed at a meeting of professed Christian activists earlier this summer.
But what really thrills them is when Trump bullies and belittles their opponents, as counterintuitive as that may seem. Evangelicals “love the meanest parts” of Trump, Christian writer Ben Howe argues in his new book, “The Immoral Majority.” Older white Christians rouse to Trump’s toxicity because he’s taking their side. It’s tribal, primal and vindictive.
So, yes, people hate religion when the loudest proponents of religion are shown to be mercenaries for a leader who debases everything he touches. And yes, young people are leaving the pews in droves because too often the person facing them in those pews is a fraud.
They hate religion because, at a moment to stand up and be counted on the right side of history, religion is used as moral cover for despicable behavior. This is not new to our age: Hitler got a pass from the Vatican until very late in the war.
Still, we are “prisoners of hope,” as Archbishop Desmond Tutu loves to say. And if you’re looking for hope in the midnight of the American soul, look no further than Pimentel’s shelter for hundreds of desperate children in McAllen, Texas.
Growing up, Pimentel was going to be an artist, she says, until she felt a strong tug on her soul; it compelled her to a lifetime of selfless service. Faith is not that complicated. Religion always is.

Washington Post: Brazil and the world need to strike a balance to save the Amazon

Texto completo: The following editorial appears in The Washington Post:
President Donald Trump was not the only populist conservative leader who drew criticism at the Group of Seven meetings last weekend in France. In between discussions of Trump’s trade wars and historically bad idea to readmit Russia to the G-7 was concern that Brazil’s new president, Jair Bolsonaro, is presiding over an environmental catastrophe, as fires burn in the irreplaceable ecological wonder that is the Amazon River basin. The Amazon rainforest is a crucial resource for all of humanity; the trick will be to persuade the current Brazilian government to act without crossing Bolsonaro’s extreme sensitivity to any perceived insult to Brazil’s sovereignty.
NASA reported last week that satellites have confirmed an uptick in fires in the Brazilian Amazon, resulting in the most vigorous fire season since 2010. “August 2019 stands out because it has brought a noticeable increase in large, intense, and persistent fires burning along major roads in the central Brazilian Amazon,” the NASA statement explained. “While drought has played a large role in exacerbating fires in the past, the timing and location of fire detections early in the 2019 dry season are more consistent with land clearing than with regional drought.” This indicates that deforestation, not preparing already cleared land for meat or soybean production, is a major culprit.
This is no surprise. Official Brazilian government figures suggest that deforestation is rising under Bolsonaro, who prioritizes development of the Amazon over environmental protection. Bolsonaro dismissed those numbers as “a lie,” igniting a fight with experts within and without Brazil. A recent New York Times analysis found that enforcement actions from the country’s primary environmental authority have dropped 20 percent during the first six months of this year, compared with the first half of 2018.
The good news, if one can call it that, is that deforestation does not yet appear to have hit the breakneck levels of the 1990s and early 2000s. But that is little reason for comfort. Amazon deforestation must be stopped. Experts worry that the rainforest is getting ever closer to a tipping point at which the water recycling that underlies the ecosystem will break down, transforming the region from rainforest to savanna or some other landscape. This “forest dieback” scenario would see massive amounts of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, stored within the Amazon’s vast amount of flora, released into the atmosphere. The rainforest will face increasing stress as global warming progresses, making the region more vulnerable to forest fires. It needs no further challenge from humans.
Yet Bolsonaro has held up a $22.2 million emergency aid package that the G-7 nations pledged to help fight the current fires, as he fights with French President Emmanuel Macron. The Brazilian president often accuses those worried about the fate of the Amazon of colonialism. Unfortunately, Macron played into Bolsonaro’s hysterics as he stressed the interest other nations have in the Amazon’s future.
Bolsonaro should stop fighting and take the aid money, and he should allay concerns donor nations might have that he will divert it to agricultural interests, which led Germany and Norway to freeze rainforest aid this year. Meanwhile, Macron and other world leaders should be willing to pony up more — and to take care that their tone expresses concern rather than command.

Leonard Pitts: Trump’s anti-journalism hit squad getting underway

Texto completo: “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers.”
So says Dick the Butcher in Shakespeare’s “Henry VI, Part 2.” Though often regarded as a Renaissance-era lawyer joke, the line is actually a backhanded compliment to the legal profession. Dick, a follower of the rebel Jack Cade, knows that before their insurrection can succeed, they have to get rid of the defenders of law and order.
<img class="size-full wp-image-2657490" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Leonard-Pitts-Color.jpg" alt="" width="290" height="193" />
We are seeing a disturbingly similar strategy unfold in American politics. Except that this time, they want to kill all the journalists.
The 2018 massacre at a newsroom in Annapolis and ongoing violence and threats against reporters make the analogy a rather sensitive one, so let’s emphasize that it’s only that — analogy. The people we’re talking about aren’t actually out to kill journalists, just their credibility.
Tom Wright-Piersanti is the latest victim. According to a report in Sunday’s New York Times, Wright-Piersanti, a Times editor, was targeted by “a loose network of conservative operatives allied with the White House.” Their aim: Discredit news organizations they consider hostile to Donald Trump. Their strategy: posting damaging or embarrassing information about journalists.
So last week, after the Times ran two pieces unflattering to the Trump White House, this group unveiled on Breitbart some racist and anti-Semitic tweets Wright-Piersanti wrote 10 years ago. He has apologized and expressed “deep shame” for “lame attempts at edgy humor” — and also, in essence, for being a millennial.
“For my generation, the generation that came of age in the internet,” he said, “all the youthful mistakes that you made get preserved in digital amber, and no matter how much you change and mature and grow up, it’s always out there, waiting to be discovered.” The Times said it was looking into what it dubbed “a clear violation of our standards.”
One need not condone Wright-Piersanti’s old tweets to note that whatever offensive thing he said, he said 10 years ago when he was in college. The last offensive thing Trump said was less than 10 days ago, and he is in the White House.
But there is far more at stake here than one man’s career. A president who has branded journalists “enemies of the people” and news media “an evil propaganda machine” now has working on his behalf an anti-journalism hit squad. These people are nothing less than termites in the woodwork of freedom.
Beyond Wright-Piersanti, they are also said to have targeted reporters from The Washington Post, Business Insider and CNN. Like him, most were in their teens or early 20s when they penned the offensive posts. Arthur Schwartz, a conservative political consultant and friend of Donald Trump Jr., described by The Times as a central figure in the campaign, says it has only just begun. The group claims to have done deep dives into the digital histories of numerous journalists — and their family members.
“Lots more where that came from,” he tweeted last week.
To which journalism as an institution must respond: Bring it.
Yes, some people may be embarrassed, some careers damaged. But bring it. Because truth itself is facing a hostile takeover. Because the machinery of authoritarianism is being assembled before our eyes. Because the people’s right to know is sacred. And because without an informed electorate, democracy is not possible.
See, this group understands what Dick the Butcher did not. The first thing you do is “kill” not the lawyers, but the reporters.
Then you can do whatever you want to the lawyers, and no one will even know.

Texto completo: Within days of Bergen-Belsen's April 1945 liberation, the British government knew it had to act. History had to be preserved lest it be disbelieved.
A team of documentary filmmakers led by Sidney Bernstein and advised by Alfred Hitchcock and Soviet filmmaker Sergei Nolbandov was assembled to capture the horrors of what was left behind at a single Nazi death camp - 13,000 yet-to-be-disposed-of corpses and around 60,000 living skeletons.
The "German Concentration Camps Factual Survey" later included post-liberation footage of the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps in Poland, but for largely political reasons it never saw the light of day - not to the public. It wasn't until the 2014 release of "Night Will Fall," a documentary by Andre Singer on the 1945 effort, that the first raw footage from Bergen-Belsen and other camps was semi-widely viewed.
One can criticize the Brits for holding onto the material for so many years - though other camp footage was available at the time - but no one can question their foresight in immediately capturing those images on celluloid. Something that can be seen can't easily be denied or misconstrued, they rightly reasoned. But that was in 1945. All bets are off today. Imagine 2045.
Anything digitized can be cynically manipulated, and with each passing day we are reminded that human beings have the frightful capacity to believe almost anything that meets their worldview. Two years ago, I watched genuine World War II documentary footage on YouTube with a voice over narration by a pro-Nazi American attempting to rewrite history. The "documentary" had about three million views and was commented on favorably more than 2,000 times before YouTube yanked it.
This junk actually sticks in people's heads. A just-released study by University College Cork in Ireland found that fake news reports can create actual false memories in the brains of people who want to believe them. The mind reconfigures what it previously knew to be true to accommodate a desirable narrative, however flimsy it may be, the study reports.
Literature and historical materials are especially susceptible to malfeasance in this world we are creating, as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Streitfeld alarmingly spelled out in a New York Times piece this week entitled, "In Amazon's Bookstore, Orwell Gets a Rewrite." Streitfeld studiously catalogued edits - outright additions, deletions and passage rewrites - to literary masterpieces being sold on Amazon by fly-by-night publishers. George Orwell's dystopian treasure "1984" was fittingly among them. A day may come when there is confusion over which version was really Orwell's or Shakespeare's or Twain's. Even handwritten manuscripts could be dismissed as forgeries to gullible audiences.
But why stop there? Might we see revised versions of the Magna Carta or the U.S. Constitution as part of an orchestrated misinformation campaign down the road?

Texto completo: Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
ESSENTIAL CINEMA: CARL THEODOR DREYER at Anthology Film Archives (through Sept. 3). The spinning wheel of Anthology's essential cinema lineup -- a rotation of canonical titles chosen by the theater's selection committee -- lands on Dreyer, whose revolutionary use of close-ups in 1928's "The Passion of Joan of Arc" (on Saturday) expanded perceptions of the possibilities of film. Even dialogue (whether rendered in intertitles or spoken) is arguably a distraction from Dreyer's visual experimentation: "Joan," "Vampyr" (on Saturday) and "Ordet" (on Sunday) will screen without subtitles, although other Dreyer works on the docket, such as "Gertrud" (on Sunday), will have them.

'THE MATRIX' at various theaters (Aug. 30-Sept. 5). A movie embraced by both the popcorn masses and the most high-minded academics (the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek has developed a veritable body of literature on it), the Wachowskis' surprise hit of 1999 turns 20 this year, though its ideas and its bullet-time photography still feel cutting edge. To mark the anniversary, the movie will screen in Dolby Cinema theaters, which feature visual and audio standards engineered to "free your mind," as Morpheus might say.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
'POLYESTER' at IFC Center (Sept. 5, 7 and 9:15 p.m.). Only John Waters could yoke a movie to a gimmick called Odorama -- in which viewers, cued by what's on the screen, could scratch a card to experience the same olfactory sensations as the characters -- and still have that film viewed as the start of a mature period. In "Polyester" (1981), Divine plays a Baltimore housewife who finds out her husband (David Samson), the operator of a pornographic movie theater, is cheating on her; she looks for love in the arms of a man played by Tab Hunter, a bit older than he was in the 1950s melodramas on which Waters is riffing. At the 7 p.m. movie, which is currently sold out (there will be a standby line), the director will introduce this new restoration, and after everyone has seen (and smelled) the movie, he will participate in a Q. and A.

'LE RAYON VERT' at the Metrograph (Aug. 30-Sept. 5). This mid-1980s Éric Rohmer picture became something of a cult hit at the Metrograph when the theater revived it two years ago. "The premise -- one woman's attempt to go on summer vacation -- is almost laughably banal," J. Hoberman wrote in The New York Times on that occasion, adding that the film "may be Rohmer's most mysterious." The title, which translates to "The Green Ray," comes from an ethereal solar phenomenon that graces the movie's haunting, enchanting finale.

'VERTIGO' IN 70MM at the Alamo Drafthouse (Aug. 30-Sept. 1, 12:30 p.m.; Sept. 2, noon). Can you ever say you've seen too much of the greatest film of all time? That's how Hitchcock's 1958 feature ranked in the 2012 edition of Sight and Sound magazine's venerated decennial poll. While watching "Vertigo" is always fruitful, seeing it in different versions is also interesting. This 70-millimeter restoration from 1996 captured the richness of the original VistaVision (a process offering increased image area that Hitchcock used in the mid- and late 1950s), even as it was criticized for what purists perceived to be an overzealous reconstruction of some of the sound effects. Bernard Herrmann's score still sounds great.

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Most of Hong Kong's newspapers carried the same photo on their front pages Monday: a police officer in riot gear, his eyes wide, pointing a revolver at protesters. The photo, also beamed around the world on satellite television, captured a single, electrifying moment in months of demonstrations, which have often been described as "paralyzing" and "roiling" this city of seven million people.
But other images tell another, less tantalizing version of events: that despite the protests, life is proceeding relatively normally.
In a video recorded by a New York Times reporter, students in a baking class barely batted an eye last weekend when black-clad protesters surrounded their classroom in a shopping mall. In a photo that spread across social media this month, a man at a street stall nonchalantly purchased fish balls, a popular snack, as smoke from a tear-gas canister swirled around him.
In short: This bastion of capitalism on China's southern coast is still going about its business. The ATMs are dispensing cash. The stock market is filling orders, although it has lost $ 300 billion in market value since June and many economists predict the territory could soon fall into recession.
High-end restaurants are taking reservations. Street vendors are hawking their wares. And with few -- but very notable -- exceptions, the trains are running on time and the airport, the world's seventh busiest, is operational. (Protesters, however, have vowed to disrupt the airport again on Sunday.)
Lawyers, civil servants, accountants, teachers and aviation employees have all held demonstrations in recent weeks -- an indication of broad antigovernment sentiment -- only to return to their jobs after a few hours, a sign that showing up to work is still a priority. Citywide transportation shutdowns and days-long general strikes have yet to materialize. The school year is set to start next week, right on schedule.
"Yes, of course people are still eating and working," said Jeffrey Mok, 33, an employee at a roadside fish ball shop in Kowloon. "Those office workers who buy their breakfast here still come every morning, and they go to work just like that."
"Just because Hong Kong has a huge problem now doesn't mean we have to put our lives on hold," he said, summing up the sentiment of many. "We are all worried, but life goes on."
The worries are real. Most residents have seen nothing like this in their lifetime. The "one country, two systems" arrangement under which China took back the onetime British colony in 1997, promising decades of freedom and relative autonomy, has never looked so fragile.
And yet the city goes on. So confident are the protesters that its ubiquitous 7-Elevens and McDonald's outlets will stay open, no matter the chaos, that the former is relied on as a dispensary of umbrellas (surprisingly good at repelling tear gas canisters), while vouchers to the latter are often distributed at marches to feed and hydrate weary protesters.
For many of the hundreds of thousands of residents who have joined the protests, demonstrating is a weekend activity. Come Monday, everyone goes back to work.
"Our lives are actually still very normal on weekdays," said Karen Lau, 22, a university student. "Just last Friday, I went to do my nails with my close friend and then we had Japanese food. It sounds funny, because the very next day we were facing tear gas and risking our lives in Kwun Tong. I think this is what's unique about our protest this time. We are all ordinary people living our ordinary little lives."
Hong Kongers may be willing to rock the boat, but for now, they are unwilling to capsize it. Beijing also seems unwilling to push the envelope too far, advancing a policy of stalemate rather than risk a bloody crackdown.
Even the local government seems torn between describing the protests as a growing menace and a contained exercise. Soon after the State Department issued a warning to American travelers visiting Hong Kong, officials here said the city remained a welcoming place for visitors and had a long tradition of peaceful protests.
"The impact of these illegal confrontations is confined to a limited area near the procession routes, and is not widespread," the government said in a statement.
Despite Beijing's claim that the protesters are attempting to foment a "color revolution," similar to those that upended governments in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, there are, as of now, no signs of the political instability or breakdown in civil society that were hallmarks of those events.
None of which is to say that the protests have been small or unsuccessful. Nor is it to say they have not taken a toll on the economy, or descended into violence.
Shops may be open for business, but those catering to foreign tourists and mainland Chinese visitors have been particularly pinched. Luxury brands, hotels and airlines have seen, or expect to see, a decline in business. Visitors are expected to put off traveling to the city because of the protests, which the authorities have characterized as "riots." Even Trevor Noah, the host of "The Daily Show," cited the protests when he canceled a comedy show here this month.
"Recent events in Hong Kong over the past two months did not substantially impact our passenger business in July," Ronald Lam, a spokesman for Cathay Pacific, the territory's flagship airline, said in a statement. "However, we anticipate a much more significant impact to our revenue in August and onwards. Traffic into Hong Kong, both business and leisure, has weakened substantially."
Thousands of residents have taken to the streets weekly since early June, when the first large demonstrations were held against an unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to mainland China, where the Communist Party controls the courts. Since then, the protesters' demands have expanded to include universal suffrage and an investigation into allegations of police brutality.
Most of the protesters have been peaceful, with rally organizers applying for permits and marchers mostly sticking to routes approved by the police.
The protesters grabbing headlines of late have not been the hundreds of thousands of peaceful demonstrators, but a subset of several hundred who are willing to block roads, destroy property and fight the police.
In a single day this month, the police used more than 800 cans of tear gas against protesters. In July, demonstrators stormed the local legislature, breaking windows and marring the walls with graffiti. Protesters have accused the police of using excessive force and letting thugs assault demonstrators with impunity. The police say they have shown immense restraint against the protesters, some of whom have attacked them with makeshift weapons.
The officer in Monday's front-page photo, for instance, was pointing his gun at protesters with sticks who were charging at him and his fellow officers. He didn't shoot anyone. But someone fired a warning shot.
Katherine Li contributed reporting.

Texto completo: REFRAMING THE HISTORY OF SLAVERY IN ANGOLA AND THE U.S.
(GIN)-If the U.S. has 35,000 museums, a writer asked in 2014, why is only one about slavery? And if the wealth of this country was built on the backs of enslaved people from Africa, why has that story been vastly under-reported in our media, in our schools and in our political discourse?
The first question was asked by John J. Cummings III, a retired lawyer who redeveloped the Whitney Plantation in New Orleans as a memorial. The second question is being examined today by writers, artists, and citizens from perspectives running right to left.
More than half a dozen museums in the U.S. today are devoted to the story of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, slavery and the complicity of the North. Since the emergence this month of a New York Times feature-The 1619 project-articles, essays, and performance pieces are also exploring and debating the subject.
'"The 1619 Project' is a major initiative observing the 400th anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. It aims to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are," the piece begins.
Similarly, in the southwest African nation of Angola, an exhibition about the slavers who sent hundreds of thousands of Africans to a bitter life of hard labor is drawing visitors by the hundreds.
The slavery museum is in Morro da Cruz, far from the hustle and bus tie of Luanda, the capital city. I:s quiet presence belies its dark past. Founded in .977 by the National Institute of Cultural Patrimony, its objective was to depict Tie history of slavery in Angola.
The building is located in the former property of .\lvaro de Carvalho Matoso, one of the largest slave-tracers on the African coast in the first half of the 13th century. Matoso died in 1798, and his family and heirs continued in the slave-trade until 1836, when a decree by Maria II of Portugal prohibitei! the export of slaves from the Portuguese empire.
The structure adjoins the 17th century Capela da Casa Grande where slaves were baptized and given Christian names before being put on slave ships for transport to the Americas.
Most of the city's African population was enslaved. Although Portugal abojshed slavery in Angola in 1878, forced labor within Angola continued well imo the 20th century.
"We learned cur history from books written by the Portuguese,' acknowledged writer Mayra de Lassalette, "and these books never hinted a: the difficulties, the resistance the frustrated efforts to rebel against slavery or the impact it had on the country."
"Angola's past depended on oral tradition-very common in Africa. But the tradition comes with a risk, because history belongs to the cne who tells it."
"Slavery was a bad thing," a young girl told me, said Mayra. "We Africans don't like to remember bad things."
"And we Angolans suffer many of them," added the writer "from slavery to colonization and Civil War."
Another initiative by UNESCO is the online Slave Route Projec: whose aim is to "remedy the general ignorance on the history of Africa by reconstructing it-and re-reading the history through purely African perspectives or more objective views of scientists or researchers."
FIRES ENGULFING WEST AFRICA EXCEED THOSE OF BRAZIL
(GIN)-While all eyes are on the fast-moving flames in the Brazilian Amazon, satellite data are showing a record 6,902 blazes in Angola in the past 48 hours.
Brazil is actually third in the world in wildfires over the last 48 hours, according to satellite data analyzed by Weather Source.
Angola's fires compare to 3,395 in the Democratic Republic of Congo and 2,127 in Brazil. It's not an uncommon phenomenon for Central Africa.
According to NASA, which operates the Aqua satellite, over 67,000 fires were reported in a one-week period in June last year, as farmers employed slash and bum agriculture to clear land for crops.
Zambia placed fourth on the list in the last 48 hours, while Brazil's neighbor in the Amazon, Bolivia, placed sixth.
On Aug. 26, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that the leaders of the G-7 -Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.K. and the U.S.-would release $22 million to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest.
"The forest is also burning in sub-Saharan Africa" he tweeted and added that he was "considering die possibility of launching a similar initiative" in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Congo Basin forest is commonly referred to as the "second green lung" of the planet after the Amazon.
The forests cover an area of 3.3 million square kilometers in several countries, including about a third in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the rest in Gabon, Congo, Cameroon and Central Africa.
Just like the Amazon, the forests of the Congo Basin absorb tons of carbon dioxide in trees and peat marshes- seen by experts as a key way to combat climate change. They are also sanctuaries for endangered species.
But these fires may not compare with those of Brazil, some experts say. "Fire is quite a regular thing in Africa. It's part of a cycle, people in the dry season set fire to bush rather than to dense, moist rainforest," said Philippe Verbelen, a Greenpeace forest campaigner working on the Congo Basin. Guillaume Lescuyer, a central African expert at the French agricultural research and development center CIRAD, also said the fires seen in NASA images were mostly burning outside the rainforest.

Texto completo: This month, the New York Times unveiled "The 1619 Project," a journalistic series in the Sunday magazine that seeks to tell the "unvarnished truth" about slavery and its impact on America's history. In 1619, just 12 years after the founding of the first permanent English settlement in the Americas, the Jamestown colonists bought the first slaves, 20 to 30 enslaved Africans, from English pirates.
The Declaration of Independence, penned by Thomas Jefferson, a slave owner, issued America's founding creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, ... endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, ... among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
As Nikole Hannah-Jones writes in her stunning introduction in the New York Times Magazine, at 43, she is part of the first generation of Black Americans in the history of this country to be born into a society in which blacks had equal rights of citizenship. Blacks suffered under slavery for 250 years, and brutal racial apartheid for a century more. We have been legally free for just 50.
Americans prefer not to face this reality. Our history classes address it gingerly, if at all. Even as President Donald Trump and cynical politicians stoke racial divisions for political profit, we too often look away from it. Trump has recently decided to make four young, newly elected congress-women of color a central target of his already launched campaign for re-election, scorning them as un-American, suggesting that if they don't like America, they should go back to where they came from. This though all four are American citizens, and three were born right here.
Trump is poisonously invoking the old lie of slavery and segregation that people of color are somehow not real Americans. Yet, as Roger Wilkins wrote in his book "Jefferson's Pillow" and Hannah-Jones in her introduction, it is the freedom struggles of Black Americans that propelled the cause of equal rights for everyone. The Constitution excluded women, Native Americans and Black people, and did not provide the right to vote to most Americans.
It is the laws born out of the civil rights movement that extended the right to vote to everyone and banned discrimination; not simply on race, but on gender, nationality, religion and disability. Without the idealistic and patriotic struggle of Black Americans, as Hannah-Jones notes,"our democracy today would most likely look very different - it might not be a democracy at all."
Recently, Ken Cuccinelli, Trump's acting director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, sparked outrage when he brazenly reworded Emma Lazarus' famous poem found at the foot of the Statute of Liberty that reads "give us your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..." What Cuccinelli probably had no clue about is that the Statute of Liberty was a gift to the people of the United States from the people of France and was dedicated in 1886 to celebrate the national abolition of slavery.
It is the figure of Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom. A broken shackle and chain lie at her feet as she strides forward, commemorating the abolition of slavery in 1865, an abolition that turned out to be the first step in America becoming in fact, as well as in word, the land of the free.
In telling the "unvarnished truth" of slavery, we will face the horrors of our past, as well as the triumph of our progress. It is a telling that is long overdue.

New survey shows conservative media is failing to reach young audiences

Texto completo: Young people increasingly seem to support a socialist agenda of "free" college, a government takeover of healthcare, and even free money from the government. For the conservative movement, finding ways to reach young voters through media is essential to changing their perspective before it’s too late. Unfortunately, new polling indicates that a majority of young people rely on left-leaning outlets to get their news fix.
According to a new survey from College Pulse, the vast majority of news outlets favored by young people are organizations with a history of left-wing bias in reporting the news. Currently, the most popular news outlets favored among college students are the New York Times, and NPR, with each holding roughly 16% of current undergraduates reporting as their favorite news outlet for a combined total of 32% of all undergraduate survey participants.
Meanwhile, Fox News came in third, with approximately 13% of undergraduates reporting them as their go-to news organization. It was one of only two conservative news outlets to crack the top 10.
Given the current imbalance in the media diet of undergraduates, it is unsurprising to see polls indicating that support for socialism is soaring among young people in America. If the vast majority of journalism reaching young people is coming from outlets that openly favor Democratic policies while regularly portraying conservatives in a negative light, it isn’t exactly shocking that young voters overwhelmingly support Democrats at the ballot box.
Still, conservatives have done an excellent job of retaking journalism by forcefully taking hold of the “new media,” a combination of cable news, Twitter, and conservative-leaning news outlets such as the Washington Examiner, National Review, and the Daily Caller. Through their efforts, Republicans have managed to break the spell of liberal bias that dominated the news industry for decades, and the average person now at least has access to coverage of both sides of current events.
But young people have largely been left out of the news equation when it comes to conservative outlets seeking a target audience. While there are plenty of left-leaning outlets such as NowThis that exclusively target young people with a progressive message, there is a severe lack of successful conservative news outlets explicitly targeting millennials and Generation Z. This must change.
In the late 1990s, Roger Ailes saw a desire for independent reporting in cable news, and managed to harness that desire into developing Fox News, the number one cable news television network today. Conservative millennials need their own Roger Ailes today, who can tap into the desire for independent-minded journalism and develop an effective news outlet for a conservative youth audience.

Texto completo: President Trump's personal assistant abruptly stepped down on Thursday.
Rick PerryThe departure of Madeleine Westerhout, who was widely regarded as Trump's "gatekeeper" and had been stationed at the front of the Oval Office, was reported by the New York Times.
The report said Westerhout was considered a "separated employee" and would not be allowed back in the White House after the president found out she "indiscreetly" divulged information about the Trump family and Oval Office operations in a recent off-the-record dinner with reporters in Bedminster, New Jersey, where Trump had a working vacation.
Westerhout, who is in her late 20s, was the subject of a Washington Post profile in September 2018, which documented her rise from Trump Tower "greeter girl" during the transition period to being executive assistant to the president. In a conversation with Watergate sleuth Bob Woodward, Trump described her as being "the key" and "the secret" to reaching him.
In November, Westerhout was one of six White House aides warned by the Office of Special Counsel for violating the Hatch Act by using their government Twitter accounts to engage in political activity.

James Comey's 'highest loyalty' is to himself

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey’s sanctimonious series of prepared tweets appeared on my timeline even before the news broke that the Department of Justice’s watchdog arm, the Office of the Inspector General, had released its findings into his conduct.
I hurriedly scrolled through to find the report, which was prepared following an investigation into the former FBI director’s “disclosure of sensitive investigative information and handling of certain memoranda.” But I shook my head at the predictability of James Comey’s vituperative preemptive strike. The report is damning, so it’s not surprising that Comey attempted to get out in front of the news cycle. Comey has shed any pretense that his ego, narcissism, and naked tribalism are any less loathsome than his antagonist: President Trump.
So what’s in the new report that has Comey so worked up?
The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, an Obama appointee, elected not to refer Comey for criminal prosecution. Not surprising.
But Horowitz concluded his report by noting his findings have been provided “to the FBI and to the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility for action they deem appropriate.” Ultimately, this equates to the IG punting the case back to the FBI’s OPR, essentially the bureau’s internal affairs unit. Comey was found to have “violated agency policies.”
It’s egregious when violations are committed by a brand new agent. It’s unconscionable when the agency standard-bearer willfully does the same.
Comey may no longer serve as FBI director, but is still accountable for his conduct while serving within the agency. This means that those who weakly contend he was no longer an employee of the FBI when he leaked, through a surrogate, sensitive FBI documents to the New York Times, simply do not understand how the Justice Department views as one and the same those who hold or have held positions of public trust.
President Trump didn’t miss an opportunity to weigh in, tweeting:Tweet
The report’s conclusions truly were breathtaking and scathing. It is almost as if the inspector general, along with much of America, had simply had enough of Comey’s constant moralizing and proselytizing. The IG pointedly concluded that what was simply “not permitted” by the Justice Department was Comey’s “unauthorized disclosure of sensitive investigative information, obtained during the course of FBI employment, in order to achieve a personally desired outcome.”
Not exactly the noble exercise of a man who famously titled his book A Higher Loyalty.
And lest you mistakenly include Comey in the pantheon of heroic, line-level organizational whistleblowers who exposed themselves at great peril, remember that James Comey is 6’ 8” tall, and arguably served as the most powerful cop in the world. Yet assumed stature aside, recall his weak and pathetic “I leaked to ensure a special prosecutor” defense. It was summarily dismissed by the inspector general who sensed that a man in as powerful a position as Comey should presumably have had enough courage of his convictions to go about things the right way.
But this is the same Comey who was left admittedly “uneasy” by his encounters with the president. Recall when he shamefully recounted to Sen. Dianne Feinstein during a June 2017 Intelligence Committee hearing that “maybe other people would be stronger in that circumstance but that — that was — that’s how I conducted myself.” Therefore, the powerful FBI director chose to covertly leak sensitive information to the media, the actions of a feckless and impotent leader.
Imagine if every FBI agent who was ever left dissatisfied with the DOJ’s decision not to prosecute a case elected to leak sensitive case information to the press. Comey would have been compelled to sanction any who did so. In the words of the inspector general, “Comey set a dangerous example for the over 35,000 current FBI employees – who similarly have access to or knowledge of non-public information.”
Some may view the world through the binary choice lens of “Trump versus Comey,” immediately leaping to blame the president for Comey’s transgressions. But, truth be told, Comey needs to own this.
I have been part of a vocal group of retired agent critics of the FBI’s seventh director. Once empathetic to the difficult position he was thrust into, I have watched with disgust his public metamorphosis from sympathetic figure into a self-aggrandizing social media foil to a president he professes to loathe but whom he appears to emulate more and more.
It’s not just me, and innumerable other disgruntled former and retired agents, who have a dim view of Comey’s FBI legacy. It is actually those who know him all too well, highlighted in the report, who describe being “surprised,” “shocked,” “stunned,” and “disappointed” at Comey’s conduct.
As are we all.

Why Aren’t Older People Using Uber And Lyft?

Texto completo: Martin Gerstell treasures his Thursday morning volunteer stint at the National Gallery of Art, where he fields questions at the main information desk. He patiently responds when visitors ask about the current exhibits, whether the paintings are real, where the bathrooms are.
Usually, fellow volunteers give him a ride from his assisted living residence in northwest Washington to the museum downtown, and home again. But when they can’t, Gerstell, 94, uses the Uber app his granddaughter installed on his iPhone.
“They appear very quickly, and they’re very helpful,” Gerstell said of his Uber drivers, who fold and stash his walker in the trunk. Summoning a taxi, his previous option, usually took 15 to 20 minutes; Uber arrives in three to five minutes and charges less, under $20, to drive him downtown.
It probably helps that Gerstell, a retired electrical engineer, handles new technology with aplomb.
Donna Nettleton has encountered a different reaction at the Oasis Institute in Shiloh, Illinois, where she volunteers to teach older people about digital devices.
Her students take happily to Facebook, but “Uber and Lyft are scarier because they involve money,” she explained. Older adults, warned continually about scams and identity theft, fear that misusing an app could empty their bank accounts.
“It’s challenging to build the confidence they need to actually use these things that could make life easier for them,” Nettleton said. So far, she’s been unable to convert any of her advisees - including her 80-year-old mother - into riders.
Safety and privacy concerns
More than half of adults over 65 own smartphones, the Pew Research Center has reported. Yet among adults 50 and older, only about a quarter used ride-hailing services in 2018 (a leap, however, from 7% in 2015). By comparison, half of those ages 18 to 29 had used them.
In a survey by AARP last year, only 29% of those over 50 had used ride-hailing apps. Two-thirds said they weren’t likely to do so in the coming year, citing in part concerns about safety and privacy. (Given data breaches at Uber, that’s no baseless fear.)
Nevertheless, transportation experts see ride-hailing as a way to improve mobility and preserve independence for older people who can or should no longer drive, or never did.
Ride-hailing - and, one day, autonomous vehicles - are game-changers, said David Lindeman, who directs health programs at the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California, Berkeley. “We have wonderful new opportunities that many people are still not aware of.”
Personalized training
One reason for such optimism: evidence that with personalized instruction, older adults can master the mobile apps and take “networked transportation” to medical appointments, entertainment and leisure activities, social visits and fitness classes.
In a newly published study, researchers at the University of Southern California offered three free months of unlimited Lyft rides to 150 older people in and around Los Angeles (average age: 72) who had chronic illnesses and reported transportation problems.
With training, nearly all used Lyft, most through the mobile app (a few used a call-in service), for an average of 69 trips. On follow-up questionnaires, almost all riders reported improved quality of life.
Contracting
But ride-hailing companies aren’t waiting around for more older adults to grow adept with their phones.
Seniors in need of transportation constitute a potentially lucrative market. So Lyft and Uber and others are contracting with third parties, bypassing the need for older riders to use apps or to have smartphones at all.
They’re joining forces with health care systems, for instance. In the past 18 months, more than 1,000 - including MedStar, in the Washington area, and the Boston Medical Center - have signed on with Uber Health for “nonemergency medical transportation,” the company said.
Case managers and social workers can use Uber or Lyft to ferry patients to or from clinics and offices, reducing missed appointments.
“Hospitals may spend millions on taxi vouchers,” said Dan Trigub, who heads Uber Health. “Uber is cheaper, and we see higher patient satisfaction.”
The companies have targeted senior living facilities, too. Most provide some sort of scheduled transportation, primarily for medical visits, but often “the residents feel limited by the shuttle - it doesn’t really provide the independence they want,” said Gyre Renwick, vice president of Lyft Business.
Now, at Brookdale Senior Living, the nation’s largest chain, as well as several other chains and communities, the front desk staff can call Lyft for residents, either billing the resident or rolling the cost into the monthly fee.
Both major ride-hail companies are also experimenting with programs for older and disabled people whose mobility problems make standard curb-to-curb services difficult to use.
The Lyft and Uber apps can dispatch wheelchair-accessible vans in several cities. In 20 cities, Uber Assist trains drivers to provide extra help for people using canes, walkers and folding wheelchairs, though riders must still be able to enter and leave the car on their own.
In the Bay Area, though, frail older people can get “door-through-door” services from 12-year-old SilverRide. Its trained, vetted drivers escort riders out of their homes, help them transfer into and out of the car, and then accompany them to their specific destinations.
“Door-to-door takes you to the entrance to the hospital,” said Jeff Maltz, a co-founder of the service. “We’ll take you all the way to the doctor’s office.” SilverRide has pilot programs underway in Sacramento, Los Angeles and Kansas City, Missouri, Maltz said, and will expand further next year.
Another smaller player, GoGo Grandparent, piggybacks on Uber and Lyft, hiring operators who can take riders’ requests on standard telephones, via push button menu, or by voice. The operators arrange the trip, charging 27 cents a minute over the ride-hailing fees. (Of course, family members can dispatch Uber and Lyft to pick up their older relatives as well, for no extra cost.)
That raises a key question: Will ride-hailing be too expensive for many seniors? In the USC study, the typical trip cost $22; the cost per month, had users actually paid it, averaged $500. After the study, about a fifth of riders said they wouldn’t continue using ride-hailing, mostly because of cost.
Some Medicare Advantage programs now cover rides to medical appointments and pharmacies; Lyft expects to partner with most Advantage plans by next year, Renwick said. But most older Americans still use traditional Medicare, which doesn’t cover such transportation.
Experts like Alexandre Bayen, director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, also worry about ride-hailing outside metropolitan areas. “The rural population might not see this for a long time,” he said. He envisions a combination of new public policies, subsidies and public-private partnerships to make ride-hailing broadly available.
One might wonder, too, about health organizations, local governments and senior communities outsourcing transit to two companies that continue to lose money and, critics warn, may prove financially unsustainable. The companies have been sued by disability advocates and by their own drivers.
Still, “it’s got great potential,” Joseph Coughlin, director of the MIT AgeLab, said of ride-hailing. “There’s been so painfully little innovation in transportation for the aging population that anything we do can only be an improvement.”

Texto completo: I teach classes in strategic political communication. Every week, for the last seven years, I have begun each class session with a simple question: "What happened in the news this week?" The idea is to draw out lessons about how strategy and power work in the digital age. I often joke that it is my job to have a professional opinion about the latest Twitter storm.
But then Bret Stephens, a New York Times columnist, emailed me on Monday night, cc'ing my university provost, to scold me over a milquetoast joke I had made on Twitter about bedbugs at the Times. I've never been a fan of Stephens, so when I saw the news about bedbugs at the newspaper and everyone joking about it, I contributed a joke about Stephens. His email was a bizarre overreaction (he was offended that I called him a metaphorical bedbug) -- the joke had gotten no traction on social media, and was pretty tame -- so I posted about his response on Twitter. Something clicked, and the story went immediately viral. The original joke had zero retweets and nine likes. It now has 4,700 retweets and 31,200 likes. I have spent the past two days in the center of the viral media controversy, instead of observing with interest from the sidelines.
(People are calling me the bedbug professor. I really hope that name doesn't stick.)

Naturally, I'll be talking with my class about it this week. When the dust settles on this silly episode, here are three lessons I think we can take from it:
This was never about civility; it was about power. Bret Stephens cc'd my provost because he wanted to impose a social penalty on me for making jokes about him online. That isn't a call for polite, civil, rational discourse. It's an exercise of power. He wanted me and my employer to realize that I had offended an important voice at the paper of record. When powerful people demand civility from those with less power, what they are really saying is that they expect obedience from their lessers.
This was never going to go well for him. I'm not sure what Stephens hoped to achieve with his email to me. He has done this sort of thing before. But he really needs to learn not to abuse his status to threaten random Twitter users. What Stephens should have realized, and what every student in my class learns, is that digital media provide a wider tactical repertoire for mounting political campaigns. Of course I was going to respond to his outlandish email by sharing the experience on social media. Of course his overreaction would be far more interesting than the original joke. We've known about this since 2005. It even has a name -- the Streisand Effect. When a person in power tries to repress online content, their actions will lead more people to see that content.
This was fun, but it could have gotten scary. Part of why this story has gone viral is that it is about so little. The daily news is terrible. The Amazon rainforest is burning, the president retweets white nationalists, the economy looks like it is heading for a recession.... By contrast, Bret Stephens, the author of "Free Speech and the Necessity of Discomfort," couldn't handle the slightest discomfort when he saw speech about himself online.
The stakes are low here, while they are terrifyingly high elsewhere. But it's worth keeping in mind that these viral media stories are usually much worse for everyone involved. I am a tenured white male professor. I have taken remarkably little online abuse as a result of this episode. If Stephens had directed his message to one of my female colleagues, they would have faced much more online vitriol. I've had zero death threats. Many women with a public platform receive a death threat with their daily morning coffee. This particular episode was pretty low-stakes, but we still have a lot of work to do here.
I keep thinking back to the catchphrase from Spider-Man -- with great power comes great responsibility. Social media changes how we exercise power.
This story will be forgotten in a week. But the lesson here is about power -- how we build it, how we deploy it, and how we use it responsibly. I hope my students learn something memorable from it. Perhaps Stephens will too.

Texto completo: Gregory B. Craig denies misleading Justice Dept., crossing into advocacy
Facing a felony count of lying to the Justice Department, former Obama White House counsel Gregory B. Craig on Wednesday testified that his legal work for the Ukrainian government never "crossed the line" into advocacy and that he never misled U.S. officials about whether his contacts with journalists required him to register as a foreign agent.
"I did not lie," Craig told a federal jury in Washington. "I did not withhold or conceal any information."
Craig's day-long testimony in his own defense marked the dramatic climax of his three-week trial over whether he made false statements to officials investigating whether he and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, should have registered as foreign lobbyists for legal and public relations work he did with GOP power broker Paul Manafort on behalf of the Ukrainian Justice Ministry in 2012.
Craig, 74, has pleaded not guilty to the charge, which carries up to a five-year prison sentence, although federal guidelines for a first offender include probation.
Spun off from special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe, Craig's prosecution has riveted Washington's political class, threatening the reputation of one of the capital's most respected Democratic attorneys, while extending the Mueller investigation's crackdown on the secret and at times grubby machinations of a small brigade of American lawyers, lobbyists and publicists employed by foreign governments to influence U.S. politics.
Manafort helped arrange for Craig and Skadden to be hired to write a report reviewing the jailing of Yulia Tymoshenko, a political rival of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, whom Manafort served as a political adviser.
The report offered a mixed review of her trial. But Ukraine's government made the report the centerpiece of an undisclosed lobbying campaign to improve Yanukovych's reputation in the West.
Prosecutors allege Craig did not want to register because he believed it could impede Skadden team members from entering government service and because he feared having to disclose that Ukrainian businessman Viktor Pinchuk had paid the firm $4.15 million for the report, undermining perceptions of Skadden's independence.
The government said Craig's outreach to journalists to explain and publicize the report in December 2012 triggered a requirement to register under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and that he deliberately lied about the timing and scope of his actions and his part in an orchestrated campaign to influence U.S. opinion for a foreign politician.
Craig testified Wednesday that his speaking with reporters may have been part of a broader public-relations campaign but that that was not his reason for reaching out.
Instead, Craig said, he spoke with reporters to refute mischaracterizations spread by Ukraine's representatives about the work, media spin that he said he opposed because it created the impression the law firm was "bought and paid for" to whitewash Ukraine's prosecution of Tymoshenko.
"I was not acting in the interests of the Ukraine. I was defending the integrity of the report," Craig said, under questioning from defense attorney William Taylor. "I did not think any of those contacts made me a press agent or agent for Ukraine . . . If we're taking actions contrary to the interests of our client, how can you say we're acting as agents of the client?"
Prosecutors allege Craig in an Oct. 11, 2013, letter to the Justice Department's FARA enforcement unit falsely said Skadden did not advise Ukraine about the distribution of the report, and that he gave a copy to the New York Times only at its request.
Rather, they allege, he wrote national security correspondent David E. Sanger to solicit coverage and hand-delivered a report copy before its public release to Sanger's home, with Craig allegedly saying Ukraine had determined the reporter should get a "first look at it."
Craig testified he agreed to handle communications with Sanger only after Sanger was contacted by Jonathan Hawker, a publicist then working for FTI Consulting, which was part of a lobbying operation run by Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates.
Gates had testified earlier in Craig's trial that, to his knowledge, it was Craig who first brought up the possibility of "seeding" news coverage in the Times with Sanger.
In his testimony, Craig denied proposing that option and said he spoke with Sanger only because he said he had"no confidence" in Hawker's honesty.
"I was concerned he would be more concerned with pleasing Mr. Gates and Mr. Manafort than being faithful with the findings of our report," Craig said, adding of Hawker, "I wasn't part of his team. He wasn't part of my team."
Prosecutors led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Fernando Campoamor-Sanchez in cross-examination - to be continued Thursday - elicited that Craig had recommended the hiring of FTI, and met with Manafort, Hawker and others at the Harvard Club of New York on Sept. 23, 2012, to discuss the media rollout.
"Well done," began an email by Manafort to Craig after news articles appeared, Craig also acknowledged on the stand. "The pro has emerged again. The initial roll out had been very effective and your backgrounding has been key to it all," Manafort wrote in the email referred to in court.
Manafort is serving a 7 1/2 -year prison sentence for conspiracy and financial fraud crimes in Mueller's probe, including for hiding more than $30 million he was paid for his undisclosed Ukraine lobbying work.
Campoamor-Sanchez questioned whether Craig was motivated by the sums Ukraine was ready to pay, noting that his Skadden teammate at the time, Clifford Sloan, at one point had written him, "Don't be bashful about asking for a lot." Earlier testimony showed Manafort and Craig agreed to backdate a $1.25 million Skadden invoice that understated how much Ukraine had already paid the firm through Pinchuk's initially secret transactions through an offshore account.
Craig said bringing in business for Skadden was one motivation, along with the legal and foreign policy challenges of the project, and the chance "to make a difference" by helping Ukraine resolve deep internal political divisions. Craig joined Skadden after leaving the Obama White House in 2010 and retired from the firm last year.
The white-haired Craig appeared relaxed and lighthearted as he testified in a crowded courtroom that included his family members and friend Harold M. Ickes, a longtime ally of the Clintons and former White House deputy chief of staff. Jessie K. Liu, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, also attended parts of Craig's examination.

Is Maine officially racist?

Texto completo: In February this year Governor Mills’ office confirmed that the slogan “The Way Life Should Be” will return to a sign near Maine’s border with New Hampshire. Governor LePage’s “Open for Business” was already eliminated. Democrats despise any suggestion that the health and welfare of businesses should impede government growth and well-being. This is pretty well understood. But replacing “The Way Life Should Be” with “Maine Welcome Home” was not acceptable to many Mainers.
A Mills spokesman has issued reassurances: “We agree that ‘The Way Life Should Be’ is a cherished, iconic part of Maine’s brand, and we will be working with the Maine Turnpike Authority to have it reappear alongside ‘Welcome Home’ as soon as possible.”
Here’s something that’s being overlooked by the new team in Augusta. The “icon” was set up in 1987 and racial sensitivities have grown enormously in size and tenderness during those 32 years. Who was talking about “white privilege” in those days? Does anyone remember hearing white liberals attacking other white liberals as racists years ago? I don’t, and I’m a quasi-octogenarian whose memory extends back to days when Bruce Willis had a full head of hair.
Consider the barely hidden message. Today Maine is the whitest state in the union, as it was in 1987 when “The Way Life Should Be” first became “iconic.” So, this sign must be telling visitors that that life should be white – come to Maine and live like a white person among other white persons. And look who’s promoting this racist message: an extravagantly white governor whose staff is nearly as Aryan as Heinrich Himmler’s bodyguard. It’s odd that those Portlanders who wish they lived in New Jersey, wallowing in its charming diversity, haven’t noticed this. Not yet, but when they do we can expect them to haul up the Virtue Banners and demand vigorous population correction policies.
Grievance-mongers all around the nation will soon notice as well. I believe the only reason they hadn’t already exploded with outrage is that they can’t expect significant racial reparations payments from our small, relatively poor state.
Readers who think I exaggerate the dangers should think about a timely example of vulnerability to racism charges. Jonathan Weisman, the New York Times Washington editor wrote a column defending Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo) against Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. McCaskill had explained her defeat by saying “Free stuff from the government does not play well in the Midwest.”
Shahid interpreted this as an attack on the far-far-far-left “Justice Democrats,” a group dedicated to defeating wishy-washy incumbents who are only far-left. Author and Times contributor Roxane Gay attacked Weisman for attacking the Justice Democrats. He demanded “an enormous apology” for her attack. She tweeted right back: “the audacity and entitlement of white men is f**king incredible.” AOC promptly accused the New York Times of abetting ‘White Supremacy.’ The man is white. Gay is black. Did the sap really think he could escape the racism stigma when he defended himself?
Read the verdict: “[Weisman] met with [Times executive editor] Dean Baquet today and apologized for his recent serious lapses in judgment…As a consequence of his actions, he has been demoted and will no longer be overseeing the team that covers Congress or be active on social media.”
Weisman wrote a book in 2018 smearing the GOP as a bunch of Nazis. Did he really believe this gave him immunity from racism charges? Janet Mills would do well to reflect on his fate, quietly drop “The Way Life Should Be,” and talk about something else. Supplementary attacks on Paul LePage should work well as a diversion.

It appears that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and celebrity chef and cookbook writer Sandra Lee are more determined than ever to part with the Mount Kisco home they’ve shared for the past several years, as they’ve just significantly slashed the asking price.
Lee is the one who actually purchased the 4,129-square-foot property, known as Lily Pond, back in 2008, though Cuomo moved in shortly after the transaction. The couple listed the four-bedroom, five-bathroom American Colonial-style abode for $2 million in May; Lee told the New York Times that the couple is downsizing now that Cuomo’s children have all moved out and they don’t need all the space with their other homes.
SEE ALSO: Zooey Deschanel Finally Sold Her Manhattan Beach Home
It’s only been three months since they offered the upstate New York property up for grabs, but now the couple has slashed the price down to $1.7 million.
There are two formal front entries, as well as a double living room with dual marble fireplaces and an oversized window seat. There’s also a step-down sunken family room with a brick fireplace, built-ins and another window seat, perhaps for reading the many, many cookbooks that surely line this house.
The kitchen is obviously all top of the line, with white marble countertops, a walk-in pantry and a center island with bar seating, plus a side nook. There’s a breakfast area by the window as well as a more formal, separate dining room. There’s also a library-den and a home theater, plus an exercise room, per the listing held by Houlihan Lawrence agent Harriet Libov.
The master suite is up on the second level; it has a fireplace, sitting area and a window suite, and the bathroom is fitted with a tub and dual vanity. There’s also a large walk-in closet.
Outside, the sprawling estate isn’t yet decked out with a pool, but there is a full pond with its own waterfall and a gazebo..
As for where Cuomo and Lee are going next? Well, it’s not like they need to add any other homes to their current real estate portfolio—they already spend time in the Manhattan apartment and Hamptons home they own, not to mention the governor’s mansion.

Texto completo: Danielle Welch, 52, of Red Bank, grew up in New Mexico butchering her own meat. She came from a family of hunters — skinning, slicing and trimming animals was expected. Imagine her family's fury when, as a teen, she became a vegetarian. She was cutting through the sinew on a hunk of venison one day and suddenly became nauseated by the blood. From that day on, she couldn't stomach meat. "I couldn't get the smell of blood out of my skin for weeks," Welch said. "That was it for me." For the next 13 years not a single bite of spicy sausage, tender sirloin or crispy chicken passed through her lips. Every time she smelled meat, all she could think of was deer blood. Until one day she changed her mind while visiting friends. "They made steaks, and they actually smelled good to me instead of like blood. So, I decided to eat one," she remembered.
Her disgust at meat was gone. In its stead was more focus and energy brought on by the protein her body was benefiting from, she said. She bid vegetarianism farewell and has been a carnivore ever since.
Is vegetarian healthier? Not necessarily In a world of scare-tactic documentaries, dewy-skinned vegan Instagrammers and bogus health blogs, it's no wonder many think veganism and vegetarianism will lead to a trim waist, glowing complexion, laser-sharp focus, perfect health, and the ability to do hundreds of V-sits in a row. But science and experience say otherwise.
"There's still a lot of junk food that's vegan," said Dawn Cascio, director of food and nutrition at Valley Hospital. "There are vegan chocolate chip cookies. A lot of processed foods like potato chips are vegan. If you don't focus on fresh fruits and veggies and unprocessed grains, you could gain a lot of weight."
As a vegetarian, Welch turned to pasta and bread to supplement her diet and wound up packing on pounds. "You're having so many starches and grains," she said. "Our bodies are not meant to break all those down. We're not cows."
Sometimes cutting out meat and dairy can be downright dangerous.
For proof, look no further than the infamous case of YouTuber Yovana Mendoza Ayres, or Rawvana as she's known. Ayres runs a vegan blog and YouTube channel, where she extols the virtues of raw vegan living (eating only plant-based foods that aren't cooked). She also sells raw vegan meal plans on her website.
But her goose was cooked when earlier this year she appeared in a fellow YouTuber's video eating (cue dramatic music)... fish! Ayres took to the Internet to do some "splaining. She said in a video that after beginning her raw vegan diet she stopped getting her period. Doctors told her that her "hormones were out of wack." She needed to eat more fat and cook her food. She was anemic and her thyroid levels were low. Then she got SIBO, a small intestinal bacteria overgrowth that can lead to malnourishment. After some advice from a nutritionist, she reintroduced eggs and fish into her diet to regain her health, all the while maintaining to her fans that she only ate raw vegan food.
'There's no one-size-fits-all diet' Of course, eating less meat and more plants for good health isn't all phooey. According to Cascio, thorough research shows a link between eating processed meats and an increased risk in developing cancer and heart disease. Eating less meat also shrinks one's carbon footprint and can reduce cruel farming practices.
Just ask Beyonce, or rather her personal trainer Marco Borges. Borges, a nutrition author who recently released the plant-based recipe book "The Greenprint," has pioneered a 22-day vegan nutrition challenge, best known for being used and endorsed by Queen B and Jay-Z.
Borges also conducted a clinical study with Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. He found that over 22 days, people who ate a whole foods (foods grown out of the ground) vegan diet saw positive results. When compared to people who ate a vegetarian diet, their BMIs (body mass index) went down five times more, their body fat reduced by four times more and their cholesterol decreased 400 percent.
If this study is any proof, cutting out meat and dairy can shed pounds and be good for your heart. But not all vegan diets are made the same.
"It's really important to distinguish between whole food plant-based and being vegan... A whole food plant-based diet is vegan, but vegan isn't always whole-food plant based," Borges said. "Whole foods come from the earth like rice, whole grains and beans Not waffles, Impossible burgers and French fries, which are also vegan"
Doctor Iris Erguder-Saman agrees. She's an MD in family medicine and the director of integrative medicine at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck. Erguder-Saman works with people who are looking to make big changes to their diet. Her tips? Avoid processed foods like veggie burgers and talk to a doctor before cutting major food groups out of your diet.
"There's no one-size-fits-all diet. Some diets work for some individuals," she said. "It's all about having a conversation and consulting with a healthcare professional."
Getting back together with meat Kassandra Gutierrez, 28, owner of the meal prep and food delivery service The Malleable Palate which is based out of Paterson, says she felt "lighter" and "better" as a vegan. A trained chef, Gutierrez knew which foods to substitute into her diet to stay healthy.
When she was 20 years old she decided to go pescatarian (eating only fish and plant-based foods), then vegetarian, then vegan, after watching the documentary "Forks Over Knives." The film advocates eating plant-based proteins instead of animal proteins, claiming the switch will reduce diseases like cancer and diabetes. But something was missing.
"I enjoy the umami flavor. I craved steak the most when I was pescatarian, seafood when I was vegetarian, and probably cheese when I was vegan," she said. After six months of being vegan, she went back to eating meat.
Jennifer Levine of Montclair went vegetarian while attending UMass Amherst because the food that came with the plant-base dining plan looked better than the others. When she graduated, Levine decided to stay vegetarian. "It became a habit," she said.
About eight years later she went to a deli with her boyfriend. She was about to order her usual meatless sandwich when her boyfriend suggested something life-changing – "Why don't you try the turkey sub?"
"It was radical. That was kind of a turning point," Levine said. She ordered the turkey sub. Then started eating meat again. Levine noticed she had more energy from that point on.
"As a vegetarian, I was carb-loading. I wasn't getting adequate protein," she said. "Since I've started eating meat again, I have a much more refined awareness of what I'm eating."
Oscar-winning actress (and fellow New Jerseyan) Anne Hathaway scrapped veganism after a fateful dinner with her husband Adam Shulman and Matt Damon. The three were dining at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Iceland. Shulman and Damon asked to eat whatever the chef was making. Hathaway asked if the salmon they were serving was local.
"And they said: 'Do you see that fjord?'" she told the publication Tatler. "So I had a piece of salmon and my brain felt like a computer rebooting."
As a vegan, "I just didn't feel good or healthy ... not strong," she said later to Harper's Bazaar.
Even Jane Brody, personal health columnist and long-time specialist in medicine and biology for the New York Times, weighed in in her 2017 column "Good Vegan, Bad Vegan." Her article was published in The Times in response to the "misstatements" made in the popular Netflix documentary "What The Health."
Eating an egg every day is just as bad as smoking five cigarettes? Eating one serving of processed meat a day raises your risk of getting diabetes 51 percent? All things the documentary claimed. All wrong, said Brody.
In the column she pointed to studies published by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology and Harvard's Department of Nutrition. Both found that eating a primarily plant-based diet would reduce the risk of cancer and heart disease, but left room for "various amounts of animal products" in their subjects' diets, wrote Brody. She also drew the distinction between good vegan food (read: broccoli) and bad vegan food (read: vegan chocolate chip cookies). The former will most likely be a positive for your health. The latter most likely will not.
"Eating is so personal and cultural," said Cascio of Valley Hospital. "Everybody is different and needs to find a diet they personally feel great on... If you feel like crap on it, it might not be for you."

Luck is not coming back to NFL

Texto completo: Anyone who has ever been jilted unexpectedly will recognize Colts owner Jim Irsay's deluded optimism that Andrew Luck might someday return.
Michael Jordan changed his mind, Irsay noted Saturday night. Brett Favre made it an annual event. Ben Watson's retirement didn't even last the offseason, while Josh McCown decided to give the NFL another go after two months.
"I don't rule it out," Irsay said. "Because as quickly as this thing sort of descended upon us, and as mysterious as it was coming upon us, it could leave the same way. … I would say it's possible."
Of course it's possible. Luck is not even 30, and there will come a time when his body is no longer battered and aching and the psychological scars from all of those injuries have faded.
But the reality is that Luck's goodbye is almost certainly final, not one he will reconsider or even second-guess.
Luck has always been a different sort of athlete – in the best sense of the phrase. While there was never any denying how much football meant to him, it also was never the only thing in his life.
That was clear in early 2011, when everyone just assumed he would forgo his senior season at Stanford to be the NFL's No. 1 pick.
He'd led the Cardinal to a 12-1 record, Stanford's best season since 1940, and finished second to Cam Newton in the Heisman Trophy voting. His coach, Jim Harbaugh, was about to leave for the NFL, and there was no reason to think Luck wouldn't be far behind.
Except there were other things equally important to Luck as playing in the NFL, even being its No. 1 pick.
"It's a Rorschach test for people's values system," Luck's father, Oliver, told The New York Times after his son's stunning announcement that he was staying at Stanford for his senior year.
Fascinated by the look of different buildings since he was a child, he wanted to finish his degree in architectural design. He also enjoyed the bubble-like atmosphere at Stanford, where he was noticed and occasionally fawned over but was still allowed to be an ordinary college student.
Even after he went to the NFL – still as the No. 1 pick – he was not caught up in the trappings of the game or the celebrity afforded its marquee players. He famously hung on to his flip phone and avoided social media.
He gave a new definition to the term "cerebral quarterback" when he started a virtual book club at the behest of fans who heard him talk of his love for reading. Each month, he'd make a recommendation for "rookie" (younger) and "veteran" (older) readers. Many of the choices were weighty, books designed to open someone's mind to the world and test his or her assumptions about it.
The selections for August: Terry Pratchett's "Nation," about refugees from opposite sides of the globe, and John Carreyrou's "Bad Blood," which chronicles the rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes and her fraudulent startup Theranos.
Almost every offseason, Luck would return to Europe, where he'd spent most of his childhood while Oliver Luck ran the NFL's offshoot there. He reveled in his anonymity there, as well as the opportunity to soak up Europe's culture and history.
The soccer enthusiast would also go to Premier League games, and fans spotted him following the U.S. men's team during the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.
All of this is to say that not only was Luck's decision not made lightly, something that was clear listening to his anguished news conference Saturday night, but that he has an advantage over so many other players who leave football only to find they no longer know where the game they have loved for so long ends and they begin.
Luck has outside interests, many of them. Though he won't want for money, he also has the blueprint for building the next part of his life from his father, a former NFL quarterback who has gone on to become a successful executive in both collegiate and professional sports.
"Excited for Andrew Luck. The next phase is going to be an amazing one for him. Super intelligent and fun guy," former NFL tight end Martellus Bennett, who has, among other things, written children's books since retiring in 2018, said on Twitter.
Luck and wife Nicole are also expecting their first child, something that no doubt factored into his decision to leave the game now. At some point, he might feel a pull to return so his son or daughter can see him play. But Luck being Luck, that sentimentality will be outweighed by his desire to see them grow up.
When something unexpected occurs, it's natural to imagine an alternate outcome. But that can only be wishful thinking in Luck's case. He's gone, and he's not coming back.

Texto completo: Google has long prided itself on a workplace culture in which employees are encouraged to speak their minds and engage in philosophical debates.
But now the company, stung by recent controversies, is trying to rein in its famously freewheeling employees. On Friday, Google issued new workplace guidelines that ordered its staff to refrain from insulting one another, from making misleading comments about the company and from "disrupting the workday to have a raging debate over politics or the latest news story."
"Our primary responsibility is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics," the guidelines read.
The new rules are a marked departure from Google's unrestrained culture that, along with the workplaces of its Silicon Valley neighbors, was once held up as a model for corporate America. But those companies have learned that encouraging employees to speak up in office forums can also court trouble.
The latest controversy centered on a former Google employee's accusations that he was fired for his conservative viewpoints and that the company aimed to help President Donald Trump's opponent in the 2020 election. After Fox Business Network aired an interview with the man, Trump tweeted that Google's alleged actions were "all very illegal." He added: "We are watching Google very closely!"
The right-wing news site The Daily Caller later revealed that the employee had urged Google colleagues to raise funds for a bounty to find a person who punched Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, in the face.
As Google's workforce swelled past 100,000 employees and the nation's politics became even more partisan, Google's culture has become a flash point. Employee walkouts have quashed several projects, and political debates on internal message boards have grown so rancorous that they have drawn Trump's ire.
In the rules issued Friday, Google urged employees to be careful in their comments about the company.
"We're all free to raise concerns and respectfully question and debate the company's activities - that's part of our culture," the guidelines read. "Be sure to speak with good information. Don't assume you have the full story, and take care not to make false or misleading statements about Google's products or business that could undermine trust in our products and the work that we do."
Google also said Friday that it was hiring a team dedicated to moderating employee discussions on internal forums. When an employee breaks the company's policies for workplace discourse, the team may remind those employees about the rules. The team can also "take other actions as appropriate in response to significant or repeated policy violations," Google said.
The public got its first view of the internal rancor at Google after the leak of an employee's memo that suggested women were less biologically suited to be engineers than men. The memo provoked an internal firestorm, and Google fired the engineer who wrote it, setting off political backlash from conservatives and fueling more news coverage.
That incident prompted Google to update its workplace rules to order employees to keep Google "a safe, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone." The company explicitly banned "trolling, name calling, and ad hominem attacks."
Months later, activists inside Google discovered their power when they successfully pushed executives to change the company's sexual-misconduct policies and halt work on projects such as artificial intelligence developed for the military.

Texto completo: Bret Stephens, a columnist for the New York Times, deactivated his Twitter account after being mocked for taking offense to a man who called him a “bedbug.”
Stephens, 45, who has championed free speech, was enraged by a tweet by George Washington University professor David Karpf, who compared an infestation of bedbugs at the New York Times office to the conservative columnist.
“The bedbugs are a metaphor. The bedbugs are Bret Stephens,” Karpf jibed.
Tweet
Karpf said Stephens emailed him, copying his boss, the university provost. In the email, Stephens said that “someone” alerted him to the tweet. He invited Karpf to “come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for a few minutes, and then call me a ‘bedbug’ to my face.”
Tweet
Stephens was widely mocked for the email, which prompted him to announce, via Twitter and then MSNBC, that he was deactivating his account Tuesday.
“Time to do what I long ago promised to do. Twitter is a sewer. It brings out the worst in humanity. I sincerely apologize for any part I’ve played in making it worse, and to anyone I’ve ever hurt. Thanks to all of my followers, but I’m deactivating this account,” Stephens wrote before his account went dark.
Stephens, appearing on MSNBC, addressed the controversy. He called the bedbug comment "dehumanizing rhetoric" and drew parallels to dictatorships throughout history.
“There is a bad history of being called a — of being analogized to insects. It goes back to a lot of totalitarian regimes in the past," Stephens said. "I’ve been called worse, I wrote this guy a personal note, now it’s out there for everyone to see."

The New York Times has been twice embroiled in controversy surrounding Twitter recently. Tom Wright-Piersanti, a politics editor, apologized for “offensive” tweets he made about a decade ago, including celebrating "Happy Jew Year."
Before that row, the New York Times demoted its deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman for “serious lapses in judgment” over tweets, including one that said Democratic congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar were not truly from the Midwest.

Chappelle's new comedy special draws heavy criticism for 'courting controversy'

Texto completo: Comedian Dave Chappelle's new special, Sticks & Stones, has drawn criticism from several media outlets for its jokes, which range from transgender issues, to Michael Jackson, to disgraced comedians, and abortion.
The special is Chappelle's fifth for Netflix, who signed him to a $20 million per-special contract in 2016. Though the previous four also elicited criticism for their perceived "politically incorrect" content, Sticks & Stones has been panned by several major publications across political divides including Vice, National Review, and the New York Times.
Chappelle, 46, starts the special acknowledging that he had caused some controversy with his specials since his comeback in 2017. "What I didn’t realize at the time was that I was breaking an unwritten and unspoken rule of show business," he said. "No matter what you do in your artistic expression, you are never, ever, allowed to upset the alphabet people. You know who I mean. Those people who took 20% of the alphabet for themselves. I’m talking about them L's and B's and G's and the T's."
Jokes over the past few specials aimed at transgender issues have drawn the most significant ire from the public and press. His new comments about the transgender community seemed to draw the strongest reaction. "The T's hate my f---ing guts," Chappelle said in Sticks & Stones.
An early review of the special from the New York Times said that Chappelle "hasn’t adjusted his material for the setting: he’s still defending wealthy, famous peers and joking about transgender targets." Speaking more about how he was offended by Chappelle's most recent work, the author continued, "Chappelle’s comedy has 'often shocked his audiences into laughter.' But there’s nothing shocking anymore about his making fun of transgender people. He does it so relentlessly that it has become blandly familiar."
Vice was similarly put off by Chappelle's performance. "The comedian doubles down on misogyny and transphobia in both the special and the hidden bonus scene that follows." The review goes onto mention Chappelle's story of bonding with a transgender fan. "The strange story of camaraderie seemed to highlight the common accusation that Chappelle is only interested in repairing his relationship with marginalized groups if he doesn't have to change anything about himself." The author warns of the bonus Q&A epilogue at the end of the special, "Chappelle has already shown his unapologetic approach to courting controversy."
National Review, which is often known to have a more conservative take than the New York Times and Vice, was also sharply critical of Chappelle, but more for his take on abortion rights and allegations against Michael Jackson. "It’s a fair warning," the author begins in his review. "In the new one-hour special, Chappelle defends Michael Jackson against charges of child molestation and says state-level abortion restrictions are a misogynist reaction to the #MeToo movement."
Many Twitter users came to Chappelle's defense amide the deluge of negative reviews. "I have no issue with people feeling however they feel about Dave Chappelle’s jokes," said comedian and writer Bridget Phetasy. "What I do take issue with is acting like he can’t joke about certain topics because they’re off limits. THAT’S EXACTLY WHY HE IS JOKING ABOUT THEM."Tweet"The Dave Chappelle Netflix stand up special is great and funny all the way throughout (a rarity these days)...and I see why the humorless scolds don’t like it," said Andrea Ruth. TweetTweet"I saw a headline saying you can feel free skip this Dave Chappelle comedy special. Yeah. Feel free to skip that review. The special was outstanding. A clinic in joke-telling, joke-writing and staying true to your thoughts and ideas," another comedian said. TweetChappelle himself offered fair warning at the beginning of the special. "If you at home watching this sh-- on Netflix, Remember b----, you clicked on my face."

'Everyone should eat pork': Steve King jokes about alleged abuse of Muslims in China

Texto completo: Controversial Iowa Rep. Steve King made another eyebrow-raising comment during a town hall gathering in Iowa on Tuesday. "Everyone should eat pork," King said after discussing alleged abuse of Muslim women in China.
King, 70, told the gathering in Audubon County that he thought China was sterilizing women of Islamic faith in the country and forcing them to eat pork, a meat strictly forbidden in the Muslim faith.
"Congressman Steve King tries to make a joke about China's alleged treatment of Muslims," tweeted an editor from political magazine Iowa Starting Line. "He said the Chinese are sterilizing Muslim women and making them eat pork. 'That's the only part of that I agree with,' King said. 'Everyone should eat pork.'"TweetKing's comments, which seemed to be making a joke about women he believed were being defiled and abused in China, come just 10 days after he told a group of people in Iowa that he believed rape and incest were largely responsible for much of the world's population.
"What if we went back through all the family trees and just pulled out anyone who was a product of rape or incest?" King, a father of three, wondered while speaking out against abortion. "Would there be any population of the world left if we did that? Considering all the wars and all the rapes and pillages that happened throughout all these different nations, I know that I can't say that I was not a part of a product of that."
He later claimed his comments could have been "softer," but that he stood by the remarks. "I would point out that genealogists have contacted me and said that's 100% correct," King said after a week of criticism. "I'd deliver that in a little softer way, though."
King also said during the town hall, "How long will it take before an entire U.S. congressional district is supplanted by illegal aliens?" Iowa Starting Line editor Paige Godden shared that King alleged such a takeover could happen in six months. "The answer, he said, assuming the average district in the US is about 710,000, is 24 weeks," she shared on Twitter.
Tweet
King, an avowed, far-right conservative, has a checkered history in terms of making controversial remarks, which eventually resulted in him losing all of his House committee assignments in January. "White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?" he said to the New York Times earlier this year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell suggested at the time that King "find another line of work."
King vowed to continue to run for his 10th term in 2020, despite disappearing support and nearly nonexistent funding. When asked whether he might consider retirement in the wake of his controversies, King replied, "No. Unless I’m dead. That’s the only circumstance."

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday, complaining about the media coverage of crowd sizes at Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s campaign events.
"They do stories so big on . . . Warren’s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!" Trump tweeted.
An estimated 15,000 people attended a Warren rally in Seattle on Sunday, according to a report by Bloomberg News.
It is also reported that she drew an estimated 12,000 people in St. Paul, Minn. , just a week before.
Trump's latest dissatisfaction with the media's crowd size coverage comes as polls show the Massachusetts senator is on the rise in the 2020 Democratic primary field. Both Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , have jumped to a virtual tie with front-runner former Vice President Biden in a new poll released Monday by Monmouth University.
More: Poll: Sanders, Warren, Biden in virtual tie for top spot among 2020 Democratic candidates
However, focusing on crowd size is nothing new for Trump as he has a history of boasting about the attendance at his campaign rallies and speeches.
Footage and images of Trump's inauguration in 2017 showed that the National Mall was partially empty during the ceremony. One expert cited by the New York Times estimated that Trump drew an audience about a third the size of President Barack Obama’s first inauguration in 2009.
Immediately after Trump's inauguration then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted that Trump had drawn “the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period. ” Then, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway famously defended Spicer’s claims by referring to them as “alternative facts. ”
Additionally, it was later reported that a government photographer edited images of Trump’s inauguration to make the crowd size appear larger than it actually was after the president was unhappy with how the event looked in photos.
Recently, after critics pushed the hashtag "#emptyseatmagatour" to the top of Twitter’s trending topics following footage showing some empty seats at a New Hampshire event, the president shared photos of the event later that night and pointed out the audience size in a series of tweets.
Offline, Trump has also remarked about the size of his crowds at various events.
While in Texas after Tropical Storm Harvey in August 2017, Trump stood on a platform and exclaimed, “What a crowd, what a turnout. ”
More recently, when visiting a hospital treating victims of the El Paso mass shooting, Trump used the opportunity to talk about how much larger his crowd had been during a rally in in the Texas city months earlier compared to the crowd at a competing rally held at the same time by Democratic presidential candidate and El Paso native Beto O’Rourke.

Former Rep. Joe Walsh to challenge Trump in GOP

Texto completo: BY TOM DAVIES
Associated Press
Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman and tea party favorite turned radio talk show host, announced a challenge Sunday to President Donald Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020, saying the incumbent is unfit for office and must be denied a second term.
"He's nuts. He's erratic. He's cruel. He stokes bigotry. He's incompetent. He doesn't know what he's doing," Walsh told ABC's "This Week." The long shot portrayed himself as a legitimate alternative in party where he said many are opposed to Trump but are "scared to death" of saying so publicly.
His campaign slogan: "Be brave."
Polls shows Trump is backed by most Republican voters, and the lone rival already in the race is former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, the 2016 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee who is regarded as fiscally conservative but socially liberal.
Undeterred from pressing ahead with his candidacy, Walsh said, "I think this thing ... will catch on like wildfire." The former Trump booster added: "I'm a conservative. And I think there's a decent chance to present to Republican voters a conservative without all the baggage."
The one-word response from Trump's campaign to Walsh's entry: "Whatever."
Walsh narrowly won a House seat from suburban Chicago in the 2010 tea party wave but lost a 2012 reelection bid and has since hosted a radio talk show. He has a history of inflammatory statements regarding Muslims and others and declared just before the 2016 election that if Trump lost, "I'm grabbing my musket."
But he has since soured on Trump, criticizing the president over growth of the federal deficit and writing in a New York Times column that the president was "a racial arsonist who encourages bigotry and xenophobia to rouse his base."
The road ahead for any Republican primary challenger will be difficult.
In recent months, Trump's allies have taken over state parties that control primary elections in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and elsewhere. State party leaders sometimes pay lip service to the notion that they would welcome a primary challenger, as their state party rules usually require, but they are already working to ensure Trump's reelection.
South Carolina Republicans have gone so far as to discuss canceling their state's GOP primary altogether if a legitimate primary challenge emerges to eliminate the threat.
At the same time, polling consistently shows that Trump has the solid backing of an overwhelming majority of Republican voters. An Associated Press-NORC poll conducted this month found that 78% of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance. That number has been hovering around 80% even as repeated scandals have rocked his presidency.
"Look, this isn't easy to do. ... I'm opening up my life to tweets and attacks. Everything I've said and tweeted now, Trump's going to go after, and his bullies are going to go after," Walsh said.
Asked whether he was prepared for that, Walsh replied: "Yes, I'm ready for it."
Weld, in an interview on NBC's "Meet the Press," said he was "thrilled" that Walsh was in the race and that Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and congressman, was considering joining them, leading to a "more robust conversation."
"Who knows? The networks might even cover Republican primary debates," Weld said.
Walsh, 57, rode a wave of anti-President Barack Obama sentiment to a 300-vote victory over a Democratic incumbent in the 2010 election. He made a name for himself in Washington as a cable news fixture who was highly disparaging of Obama.
Walsh was criticized for saying that the Democratic Party's "game" is to make Latinos dependent on government just like "they got African Americans dependent upon government." At another point, he said radical Muslims are in the U.S. "trying to kill Americans every week," including in Chicago's suburbs.
He lost his 2012 reelection bid by more than 20,000 votes to Democrat Tammy Duckworth, who was elected to the U.S. Senate four years later.
Walsh told Obama to "watch out" on Twitter in July 2016 after five police officers were killed in Dallas. Just days before Trump's 2016 win over Hillary Clinton, Walsh tweeted: "On November 8th, I'm voting for Trump. On November 9th, if Trump loses, I'm grabbing my musket. You in?" Walsh later said on Twitter that he was referring to "acts of civil disobedience."
On Sunday, Walsh said he apologized for past divisive comments.
"I helped create Trump. There's no doubt about that, the personal, ugly politics. I regret that. And I'm sorry for that," he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has completed three weeks of radiation treatment for a localized cancerous tumor on her pancreas.
"The abnormality was first detected after a routine blood test in early July," the Supreme Court said in a statement Friday. ”The tumor was treated definitively and there is no evidence of disease elsewhere in her body. Justice Ginsburg will continue to have periodic blood tests and scans. No further treatment is needed at this time. ”
Here is what we know about Ginsburg's health and her previous battles with cancer.
Ginsburg v. cancer
Ginsburg has a long history of fighting various forms of cancer.
More: Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg treated for malignant tumor on pancreas
Her latest treatment comes less than a year after she underwent an operation to remove cancerous growths from her lungs in December. The growths were discovered after a fall that resulted in three fractured ribs.
Ginsburg endured a lengthy battle with colorectal cancer in 1999. A decade later, she had pancreatic cancer, often deadly but in her case detected early. In 2009, two growths were removed from her pancreas, one of which was benign, along with her spleen, the Washington Post reported at the time.
“She was very lucky in 2009,” Dr. Hedy Kindler, a professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, told USA TODAY.
What is pancreatic cancer?
The Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research says that in 2019, an estimated 56,770 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the U. S. , and more than 45,750 will die from the disease. Pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers.
Pancreatic cancer often doesn't show any obvious signs, which is why it's typically not found until its late stages, according to the American Cancer Society. The pancreas is deep inside the body, so early tumors can’t be seen or felt by health care providers during routine physical exams.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the pancreas releases hormones, including insulin, to help your body process sugar in the foods you eat as well as produces digestive juices to help your body digest food.
When the tumor is only in the pancreas and doesn’t spread, the five-year survival rate is 37 percent, according to Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, or PanCAN.
However, this form of cancer is one of the world’s deadliest and overall still has a five-year survival rate of just 9 percent, according to the American Cancer Society's 2019 Cancer Facts & Figures Report. This is because oftentimes the disease does spread elsewhere throughout the body.
It is unclear what kind of pancreatic cancer Ginsburg has suffered from exactly.
Can you cure pancreatic cancer?
USA TODAY asked oncologists about how, and if, you can cure the disease.
Dr. Kindler explained to USA TODAY that the most effective way to cure pancreatic cancer is through removing the affected parts of the pancreas, and that is how Ginsburg was treated in 2009. It is not clear whether any part of her pancreas was removed this past summer, as removing the whole pancreas results in “developing bad diabetes and other health problems. ” Dr. Kindler continued, “My guess is it wasn’t removable. ”
“When you do localized radiation aimed at just where the tumor is, there is the possibility to control the tumor and control it for a long time. ” Dr. Kindler stated.
Regarding treatment, Dr. Ottis Brawley, a professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University, told USA TODAY, “Someone who exercises like Ginsburg does, those folks tend to do better than folks who are very much affected by the tumor. It is possible for her to do very well. ”
“I can say that the statement from the court is the absolute most positive statement that any doctor can make about the situation. That is the most hopeful statement that we can have,” he continued.
Ginsburg's cultural relevance
Justice Ginsburg stands at just 5-foot-1 but has taken on the status of a larger-than-life cultural figure in recent years. She is the oldest justice on the Supreme Court; she was appointed by President Bill Clinton and confirmed by the Senate in 1993.
Ginsburg was the second woman ever appointed to the high court, after Sandra Day O'Connor, who served from 1981 to 2006.
Ginsburg is a former women's rights lawyer who argued groundbreaking gender discrimination cases before the Supreme Court early in her career. She was just one of nine women granted admission to Harvard Law School in 1956 in the early years of the elite institution going co-ed.
More: How Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a legit pop-culture icon
The liberal jurist has become known in popular culture in recent years as "Notorious R. B. G. " -- a play on the late rapper Notorious B. I. G. -- after an internet meme was created that features a visage of the justice wearing a crown and her trademark lace collar. The rap-inspired nickname was also the title of a blog by former New York University law student Shana Knizhnik launched in the summer of 2013, when Ginsburg delivered a particularly scathing dissent about the imperative of voting rights in states with histories of racial discrimination.
The 2018 film "On The Basis of Sex" took a deep dive into Ginsburg's early career as a struggling attorney who faced obstacles in her fight for equal rights. The film highlights Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, a seemingly minor case involving an unmarried man who was denied a $600 tax deduction for payment for his aging mother's caretaker, on the basis of sex.
On the Supreme Court, Ginsburg has become known for her dissenting opinions as she has served on the court for more than two decades during which it has had a conservative majority. "When a justice is of the firm view that the majority got it wrong, she is free to say so in dissent. I take advantage of that prerogative, when I think it important, as do my colleagues,” she explained in a New York Times opinion piece she wrote in 2016.

A shameful anniversary that forces America to confront uncomfortable truths

Texto completo: Four hundred years ago, in August 1619, a year before the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock, English pirates sold 20 to 30 enslaved Africans to colonists in Jamestown, Virginia. It was the first time black men and women set foot on the shores of what would later become the United States.
And it was the beginning of slavery in America.
Last weekend, the New York Times published a special magazine issue devoted to essays about how slavery shaped our country and how it continues to influence us today. The "1619 Project" encourages Americans to re-think our history and look beyond the narratives we were taught in school.
As Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project's lead reporter, wrote: "The United States is a nation founded on both an ideal and a lie."
As we now know, when Thomas Jefferson wrote those inspiring words in the Declaration of Independence - "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal" - he was being waited on by a teenage slave, his wife's half-brother, who could enjoy none of those rights and liberties.
It's not easy to admit that our nation, which we like to think of as a beacon of liberty and freedom, bears the stains of slavery and a deep-seated racism. We see their legacy in today's income inequality, incarcerations, debates over affirmative action, and police shootings of unarmed black teenagers.
But unless we honestly face our past, America will never be the country that whites like to think it is but that blacks know it has never actually been.
Conservative pundits have criticized the 1619 Project because it views history through "racial lenses." But, those pundits view history through "racial lenses" - "white" ones. Their version of history refuses to recognize the fundamental role that slavery and racism have played in our country.
We've also seen echoes of this in the controversy over the murals depicting the life of George Washington painted by Victor Arnautoff in the 1930s at Washington High School in San Francisco. Panels in the murals depict Washington as a slave owner and show pioneers stepping over the body of a Native American.
Opponents of the murals don't want students, especially those that are African American or Native American, to have to see the violence portrayed in the murals every day as they walk through school.
Supporters, however, argue that Arnautoff painted those scenes specifically because he was critical of attempts to gloss over the racism in our founding fathers and our country as a whole.
Alice Walker, author of "The Color Purple," said in a recent interview about the murals, "Why try to hide the reality of our history - which is terrible? If you really want to educate people, leave the stuff and teach [students] what it means..."
The issue is how to do that while ensuring that current students are not made to feel less valuable - or less American - because of it.
The Washington murals can help jump start the kind of honest discussions about slavery and racism that the 1619 Project suggests we as a country need but have avoided for too long. But only if the murals remain accessible. (The school board has voted to cover them up).
America does have noble ideals at its core - freedom, democracy, equality - and it does not diminish those principles to admit that we have fallen short of them.
Ironically, Hannah-Jones notes in her essay that black people may have the most deep-seated belief in the fundamental promise of America - freedom and equality.
"No one cherishes freedom more than those who have not had it," she writes. "Our founding fathers may not have actually believed in the ideals they espoused, but black people did. . For generations, we have believed in this country with a faith it did not deserve. Black people have seen the worst of America, yet, somehow, we still believe in its best."
We should never forget what happened 400 years ago, in August 1619, and the centuries of anguish that came afterward.

Dynasty and tragedy

Texto completo: html> It was dark in room 107 of the Brazilian Court. The blinds were down. A “Do Not Disturb” sign hung on the door.
An employee of the historic Palm Beach hotel knocked quietly. No answer. She used a pass key to enter the room that morning of April 25, 1984. She saw two beds, still made.
“Then, almost immediately, I saw David,” recalled hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett. “He was on the floor, between the beds. I looked at him. I touched his face and there was no doubt about it — he was dead.”
The haunted life of David Anthony Kennedy — troubled son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy — was over at age 28.
But a complex year-and-a-half-long investigation into his drug overdose death was just beginning, marking another sad chapter in both the saga of America’s most well-known political family and the annals of Palm Beach scandal.
Before it was finished, the media free-for-all involved lurid stories of cocaine, bellhops, an opera singer, a shadowy dealer named “Armando” and a funky bar called the Kenya Club. Famous Kennedys — from David’s mother Ethel to cousin Caroline to ailing grandmother Rose — were dragged into the spotlight.
The State Attorney’s Office found itself under siege by the mainstream press, which went to court repeatedly to get documents related to the case, as well as pesky tabloids, which were flashing money all over town and printing rumors as fast as they paid for them.
Kennedy’s life ended that spring day in 1984, from a mixture of cocaine and two prescription drugs: the painkiller Demerol and tranquilizer Mellaril. Narcotics experts said overuse of just one of the drugs was potentially lethal, but a cocktail mix of all three was a sure death.
What led to this privileged scion’s downfall?
Some traced its roots to the summer of 1968, when a young David was with his family at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. He was watching television when he saw news footage of his father being shot downstairs after giving a victory speech in the California primary, another Kennedy cut down by an assassin’s bullet.
Friends said he was never the same again.
’A tormented, sensitive son’
David Kennedy didn’t come to Palm Beach on a whim. It was a gathering of the clan. Matriarch Rose Kennedy had suffered a stroke, and family members convened at the longtime Kennedy compound on the northern end of the island expecting the worst.
John F. Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline, was there. So was cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy and David’s brother, Joseph Kennedy II, as well as his aunts, Jean Smith and Eunice Shriver.
Along with younger brother Douglas, David checked into a $150-a-day room at the Brazilian Court about five days before his death. He was carrying heavy emotional baggage that had taken years to accumulate.
After his death, The New York Times would describe him as a “tormented, sensitive son,” reporting that his father’s assassination in 1968 had “sent
him into a 15-year slide.”
A painful car crash in 1973 might have started his drug dependency, the paper said. Substance abuse problems followed when he entered Harvard, where he was an indifferent student.
But he also found time to party at Manhattan discos and live the glamorous life of a Kennedy. He even squired actress Rachel Ward (“The Thorn Birds,” “Against All Odds”), who told the Times that Kennedy had “a wonderful sense of humor and was always very merry.”
By 1976, though, he had dropped out of college, gone in and out of detox programs and was found beaten up in a Harlem drug “shooting gallery,” the Times reported. More stints in rehab followed, including one in Minnesota just before he arrived in Palm Beach.
A friend told the Times he was “a sick, sick young man” and that Kennedy suffered from continuing nightmares about his father’s death.
Looking to score ’stuff’
In Palm Beach, Kennedy’s demons became apparent. The then-owners of the Brazilian Court initially said Kennedy’s behavior was “within the bounds of a young gentleman on vacation.”
But a medical examiner’s report indicated that he was told to leave Rose Kennedy’s home a day before his death because he was “drunk or stoned.”
He was seen drinking at Palm Beach watering holes such as Chuck & Harold’s, Doherty’s and the Kenya Club bar, as well as the Raindancer restaurant on Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard in West Palm Beach.
Press reports at the time varied on whether his partying and clubbing was beyond the bounds of a young vacationer, with some saying he consumed numerous vodkas and others saying his intake was exaggerated in the media.
But according to witness statements, Kennedy was soon asking around the hotel for “stuff”: namely, a supply of cocaine.
Harriet Couch, who performed with a New York opera company, said she watched Kennedy pull out a packet of white powder and a straw after a night of drinking at the Kenya Club. And 1.3 grams of 70-percent pure cocaine were found in Kennedy’s hotel room after his death.
Two Brazilian Court bellhops, David Linwood Dorr, 31, of West Yarmouth, Mass., and Peter Andrew Marchant, 24, of Warwick, R.I., were eventually charged with providing cocaine to Kennedy. Trying to trace their source led to an intriguing bit of testimony from Derrick Evans, a Kennedy acquaintance.
When asked by investigators where the cocaine came from, Evans mentioned “this guy Armando, or whatever, a shady character who stayed in his house with the shades down all the time and only went out at night.” Armando, if he existed, was never found.
More than a year and a half after they were arrested, Dorr and Marchant both pleaded no contest to a single charge of conspiracy to sell cocaine. Another charge that could have led to significant jail time was dropped. They were each fined $200 and sentenced to 18 months’ probation.
Useless tips and conspiracy theories
While it took until December 1985 to close the books on the Kennedy death, The Palm Beach Post kept busy reporting on every tantalizing detail and conspiracy theory in the case.
For example:
•Drug traces were found in the toilet of Kennedy’s hotel room. Did somebody try to flush evidence before Kennedy’s body was found? Palm Beach police conducted a tampering investigation, but never charged anybody. Some speculated that Kennedy had injected Demerol via syringe and that the syringes were disposed of in the toilet. (Investigators also thought the Demerol was part of a vial missing from Rose Kennedy’s home.)
•A hotel employee claimed Caroline Kennedy could have entered David Kennedy’s hotel room before his body was found. She issued a statement emphatically denying she entered the room, and police said they found no evidence that she did.
•A man told local radio show host Jack Cole that Kennedy cousin Sydney Lawford McKelvy tampered with evidence at the death scene. Kennedy family attorneys called it “total hogwash.” And the man later admitted his statement was false, “the result of alcohol-induced speculation,” according to then-State Attorney David Bludworth.
•An informant for the FBI said that Kennedy might have been targeted for death by drug dealers because he was trying to score cocaine on credit and the cache of his name. The informant’s leads “didn’t provide any useful information,” a Palm Beach police detective said.
•Hotel secretary Elizabeth Barnett, who discovered the body (though others said it was a bellman or a maid), later wondered about the “very peculiar angle” of Kennedy’s body in the room. She speculated that he may have died elsewhere and was carried into the room. “I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights because something isn’t setting right,” she said.
•Tabloids, including the National Enquirer, were offering hotel workers from $500-$1,000 for inside stories about the Kennedy death. One bellman said he was offered $5 to reveal the color of Kennedy’s room. The bellman told the reporter it was pink, when it was really white.
•Police received lots of useless tips. One person thought Kennedy’s death was caused by “Communist infiltrators.” Another said the fatal overdose was done by hypnosis. Yet another said that Kennedy’s supplier was a “tall, but very skinny, very pale, hooked-nose man with acne scars.”
•Why did the hotel check on Kennedy in the first place? His mother Ethel frantically called that April morning, saying he didn’t show up as expected on a flight to Boston. When the hotel called her back to relay the terrible news, she blurted out, “He’s dead, isn’t he?” and hung up the phone.
•Rose Kennedy was never told about her grandson’s overdose, at least not at the time. And despite worries that she was in imminent danger of death, she lived another 10 years.
•Just a week after Kennedy’s death, the Brazilian Court closed and was sold to new owners. It did not reopen until the end of 1985. After a long series of ups and downs, it is now one of the island’s swank addresses, with a pedigree restaurant, Cafe Boulud, and a serious upgrade from its dowdier 1984 look.
No end to heartache and notoriety
As for bellhops Dorr and Marchant, they claimed they were innocent before and after accepting plea deals. Marchant agreed to spare his ailing father, according to his lawyer. Dorr said he just wanted to “end this nightmare.
“I feel in no way was I responsible for (Kennedy’s) death,” Dorr told the Associated Press. “I never bought cocaine in my life. I was aware there was coke in Palm Beach, but I stayed away from it.”
Their lawyers believed they would have never been charged if the last name of the victim hadn’t been Kennedy. Prosecutors freely admitted that they put more effort — and expense - into it for that reason.
In the end, Assistant State Attorney Pablo Perhacs said nobody was happy with the outcome. Some wanted the bellhops jailed. Others wondered why the mysterious supplier was never found and prosecuted. “I was caught in a no-win situation,” Perhacs said.
As for the Kennedy family, there is seemingly no end to the heartache and notoriety.
Seven years after David Kennedy’s death, William Kennedy Smith would be charged and acquitted of rape in a case that brought even more intense media coverage to Palm Beach.
And earlier this month, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, died of an alleged drug overdose. Newspapers reported that tragedy had now scarred a new Kennedy generation.
At age 22, Hill was six years younger than David Kennedy — the uncle she never knew.

Texto completo: I was planning to write about MSNBC's Brian Williams and his nightly show "The 11th Hour" the week of Sept. 6, which will mark the production's third anniversary.
My premise: Brian Williams and his production team have made "The 11th Hour" into the "Nightline" of this new media age. I am talking about Ted Koppel's "Nightline" during its glory years in the 1980s and '90s when it was the last word on news and set the national agenda like no other newscast on network or cable. It was the one indispensable news program of the day. (Koppel was anchor and managing editor from the show's inception in 1980 to 2005.)
Given the vastly different digital landscape of today versus the one on which Koppel operated, I am sure my premise will be challenged. But what I am saying is that, like "Nightline," "The 11th Hour" has become for me the one show I go out of my way to see every night before I call it a day. And when I do, I feel like I am not only plugged into the flow of the day's most important news but also have been offered an informed context and perspective on it. And the number of shows, newsletters, podcasts and video productions that "the 11th Hour" competes with on multiple screens today is exponentially larger than the competition Koppel's "Nightline" faced.
So, why am I writing about Williams and "The 11th Hour" today instead of Sept. 6? I am doing so because Williams blew me away with his coverage and commentary last week on lead-contaminated drinking water in Newark. Such outstanding work demands to be praised. But the media beat is so Trump-driven, nano-second-crazed and helter-skelter these days that if I don't write about it now, I might not get a chance during the anniversary week, and that would be a shame.
Here's Williams introduction Thursday night for a video report and in-studio interviews on the water crisis:
"The largest city in the most densely populated state in our union, Newark, New Jersey, has been staggered by a crisis over lead in the drinking water that the city has known about for years. This affects thousands of homes, most of them in low income neighborhoods where lead pipes bring the water in from the street," he told viewers.
"An effort to hand out filters to home owners failed when some of the filters failed. And then this week an effort to hand out bottled water to those willing to come and get it in the hot sun was botched. And just like what we've witnessed in Flint, Michigan, what's happening in Newark, New Jersey, exposes the intersection of poverty and health and race and class and the word that has come to mean so much that it now means virtually nothing, infrastructure."
That last sentence is the smartest I heard from any show host on cable TV last week. It instantly gave viewers the deeper sociological context through which to filter all the information that followed.
Williams further did something cable hosts rarely do: He acknowledged his own privilege in a question he asked one of his panelists, New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti, who covers New Jersey for The Times.
"For what it`s worth, Nick, again as someone who was born and raised in the state, if this were happening in my hometown of Middletown where the current governor lives now or Summit or Bedminster or Rammstein, there would be holy hell going on, and we all know it, that this is part of race and class. Has a leader emerged to step forward and say I`m going to help fix this?"
But Williams, who characterized himself Thursday night as being "a little charged up about this," had even more to say about Newark before he signed off. In a closing commentary, he went beyond the sociological context to take an even larger view in linking Newark's failed response to the lack of national leadership today.
"On this day in 1914, the Panama Canal was opened. It was and remains one of the great engineering feats of all time. It changed the world. It redefined what was physically possible," he began.
"It took the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt to ride to it completion, to overcome obstacles, make sure it got done. This week is also the anniversary of V-J Day in 1945 when in colossal fashion following the only use of atomic weapons in the history of the world, the United States won the war in the Pacific, having vanquished tyranny both on the European front and across the Pacific Ocean. It took the leadership of Franklin Roosevelt who did not live to see the victory he engineered," he continued.
"Why do we talk about our history every chance we get?" he asked. "Very simply, to remind ourselves who we are and yes in many cases, who we used to be. We`re hoping it will be useful for citizens. Perhaps the citizens of Newark, New Jersey. The next time any elected leader there says, 'We`re sorry, we just can`t get you water to replace the poison in the pipes into your home, you`ll have to come get it. We know it`s hot. The lines are long and the water is heavy. But there is really no way we could get it to you.' Remind them that at one time we were the wonder of the world, carving a path through the surface of the earth to join two oceans, later crossing those oceans to help save the world."
If you cannot hear echoes of Edward R. Murrow in that writing, you are not listening. That is about as good as gets when it comes to TV news. And it is not all style. There is meat on the bones of what Williams has to say about the importance of knowing and talking about history, as well as his insights into the higher meaning of leadership. I love that he called out the leaders of Newark for their indifference to the harm and suffering of citizens as result of both the lead in their water and the city's lack of a serious effort to distribute bottled water. We could use more of that from the media in Baltimore when it comes to our leaders at City Hall.
I was one of the critics who denounced Williams in 2015 over false claims he made about his role in combat coverage, claims that ultimately led to his removal as managing editor and anchor of the "NBC Nightly News." As I said at the time, what he did was seriously wrong, and it demanded serious punishment, which NBC rendered in ultimately replacing him at the "NBC Nightly News" anchor desk with Lester Holt.
But I am glad the network found a new space for Williams to use his talent and experience in anchoring MSNBC's "The 11th Hour." At this moment when journalism and a free flow of reliable information are under continual attack from the Trump administration and its many media allies, our democracy is made stronger by having Williams and this production at the end of each weeknight to offer perspective on the political and cultural warfare that now dominates the conversation our of nation's civic life.
So, here's an early wish for a happy anniversary to the team that makes "The 11th Hour." And here's hoping you will be around for many more nights to give me and your other regular viewers so much of the news in one place at the end of some of the most tumultuous and challenging days those of us in the information business have ever faced.
Please, stay charged up.

Michelle Goldberg: Mazel Tov, Trump. You’ve revived the Jewish left.

Texto completo: On Aug. 11, more than 1,000 people marked Tisha B’Av, the saddest day in the Jewish calendar, by occupying an Amazon Books store in Manhattan, protesting the technology behemoth’s technical support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sitting on the floor, they read harrowing accounts of people in immigration detention and recited the Kaddish, the traditional Jewish prayer of mourning. One of their signs said, “Never again means never again.”
According to organizers, 44 people, including 12 rabbis and a member of New York’s City Council, were arrested. It was one of over 50 Jewish-organized demonstrations against ICE held across the country that day.
A few days later, a corrections officer drove a truck into a row of Jewish protesters who were blocking the entrance to a private prison in Rhode Island where migrants are being detained. Two of the protesters were hospitalized. That demonstration was one of at least 38 organized this summer by Never Again Action, a decentralized group formed two months ago to engage in nonviolent direct action against immigrant detention.
President Donald Trump might have thought he was going to lure Jewish voters to the Republican Party with his lockstep alliance with the Israeli right. Instead, by attempting to use American Jews as mascots for an administration that fills most of them with horror, he has spurred a renaissance of the Jewish left.
New progressive Jewish groups are forming. Older ones, like New York’s Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, one of the forces behind the Amazon action, are growing; once-sleepy organizing meetings have become standing room only. Jewish Currents, a left-wing Jewish publication founded almost 75 years ago, was reborn last year with a new cadre of writers and editors who speak to the millennial socialist zeitgeist.
Obviously, American Jews have long leaned liberal, and have always been overrepresented in progressive movements. But there’s a difference between leftists who happen to be Jewish and explicitly Jewish left-wing activism.
“People who may not have been that close to Jewishness, they feel suddenly like it’s very important to express who they are as Jews in the context of their activism and in the context of their collective memory,” said Arielle Angel, the editor of Jewish Currents.
Alyssa Rubin, a 25-year-old organizer with Never Again Action, told me that in college, she had little interest in Jewish communal life, much of which seemed to revolve around support for Israel. But in the months leading up to the 2016 election, as Trump spouted rhetoric that smacked of fascism and white nationalists grew giddy at their new relevance, “I had never thought about my Judaism more,” she said. For the first time, anti-Semitism seemed an immediate, urgent threat.
For Jews on the left, fear has been magnified by insult as Trump, the man who helped unleash a new wave of anti-Semitism, posed as the Jews’ savior because of his devotion to the Israeli right.
“It’s infuriating and intolerable,” said Sophie Ellman-Golan, 27, the former director of communications and digital outreach at the Women’s March organization, who is now working on a project to mobilize Jews against white nationalism. Because the right purports to defend Jews even as it pursues policies that most Jews abhor, she argued, “it’s imperative that we loudly speak for ourselves because if we don’t the loudest voices that claim to speak on behalf of Jews will be right-wing evangelical Christians.”
There are, of course, plenty of established Jewish groups that make it their mission to speak for the community. But it’s hard to overstate the degree to which left-wing Jews feel alienated from and betrayed by the Jewish establishment, which often seems more concerned with left-wing anti-Zionism and rhetorical overkill than with right-wing white nationalism.
Never Again Action was born in reaction to the perceived failures of mainstream Jewish organizations to stand up to Trump. In June, after Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez referred to migrant detention camps as “concentration camps,” establishment Jewish outfits like the Jewish Community Relations Council rushed to condemn her. Rubin was incredulous.
A militantly xenophobic government is building internment camps for members of ethnic out-groups, and Jewish leaders worried that critics of this project were disrespecting the memory of the Holocaust?
“That compounded the outrage that a lot of Jews were feeling, that a mainstream Jewish institution would say something that just felt so out of touch,” she said. “That in part led us to really want to not just say in words, but actually take action to show how the Jewish community actually feels about this moment.”
People involved in the new Jewish left recognize that left-wing anti-Semitism exists. But they generally don’t believe it’s a threat on par with right-wing Jew hatred.
“No political party or movement is free of anti-Semitism,” said Ellman-Golan, who had to deal with the fallout from anti-Semitism at the Women’s March. But, she said, “only one political party is quite literally inciting white nationalists to shoot up our synagogues, drive cars into our peaceful protests, mail bombs to members of our community, burn black churches and mosques, and open fire on Latinx people.”
The Jewish left rejects the idea that anti-Zionism is equivalent to anti-Semitism, but even more than that, it rejects the idea that Israel is the guarantor of Jewish safety or the lodestar of Jewish identity. A central value of Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, as well as for much of left-wing Jewish culture more broadly, is “doikayt,” a Yiddish term that means “hereness.”
“Where we are is our home. This is what we fight for. This is where we seek kinship,” said Audrey Sasson, JFREJ’s executive director. The first post-relaunch issue of Jewish Currents featured an essay by the publisher, Jacob Plitman, called “On an Emerging Diasporism,” which likewise celebrated the value of “hereness.”
For those primarily concerned about Jewish life in the diaspora, Israel, which has courted anti-Semitic nationalist leaders in Europe, isn’t really an ally, much less an ideal. And Trump, who always speaks of American Jews as if they belong there , is a grotesque enemy. He tells Jews committed to life in America that they owe loyalty to Israel, which he sometimes calls, when speaking to American Jews, “your country.” He says this, and expects Jews to react with gratitude.
Instead, many are reacting with a redoubled commitment to multiracial democracy and solidarity.
Jews have been taking to the streets because no amount of support for a foreign country can redeem what he’s doing to this one.

Texto completo: On Sunday, former Illinois Rep. Joe Walsh addressed his role in stirring racist rhetoric in politics in the past while announcing his intentions of challenging President Donald Trump in the Republican primary.
Walsh apologized for his past comments during an appearance on ABC's "This Week with George Stephanopoulos" in which he said he had a role in Trump's ascension.
“I helped create Trump, there’s no doubt about that,” he said.
Walsh went on to offer his opinion of Trump: “He’s nuts, he’s erratic, he’s cruel, he stokes bigotry. ”
He also wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed that Trump “inspires imitators” but brought up his own “share of controversy. ”
“At times, I expressed hate for my political opponents. We now see where this can lead,” he wrote. “There’s no place in our politics for personal attacks like that, and I regret making them. ”
Walsh's past comments
In 2014, Walsh was pulled off the air during his radio show for using racist slurs. He also promoted the "birther" conspiracy during former President Barack Obama's time in office and said Obama was only elected because he is black.

When asked by Stephanopoulos on Sunday to address instances of his own racism, including his promotion of the false conspiracy that Obama is Muslim and remarks against Sen. Kamala Harris, Walsh said he has reflected on his previous statements.
“I said some ugly things about President Obama that I regret,” Walsh said.
In 2017, Walsh tweeted “We LOWERED the bar for Obama. He was held to a lower standard cuz he was black. ”
“I had strong policy disagreements with Barack Obama, and too often I let those policy disagreements get personal,” he said Sunday.
He's been all over the place on Trump's comments
Walsh has a history of inconsistency in his opinions of Trump’s rhetoric. At times, he has denounced the president as a racist. This summer when Trump told four Democratic congresswomen, who are people of color and citizens of the U. S. , to “go back and help fix” the countries he said they “originally came” from before trying to make legislative changes in the USA, Walsh spoke out.
“To say 'go back to where you came from' is gross. It’s offensive, ignorant, anti-American, and racist,” Walsh tweeted.
But it was not that long ago that Walsh thought Trump’s language made him a bully, but not a racist, and that Walsh was still making racist claims about Obama:
Why he's apologizing
Walsh said the one good thing about Trump's language since he has been in office is that Trump has made him realize his attacks were inappropriate. The difference between them?
“We have a guy in the White House who’s never apologized for anything he’s done or said. I think it’s a weakness not to apologize," Walsh told Stephanopoulos. "I helped create Trump, there’s no doubt about that. The personal, ugly politics, I regret that and I’m sorry for that. And now we’ve got a guy in the White House, George, that’s all he does. ”

'Factory' offers peek at Obamas' mission

Texto completo: If their first film from is any indication, more fantastic movies and shows are on the way from former President Barack and former first lady Michelle Obama's new production company.
The Obamas launched Higher Ground Productions last spring in partnership with Netflix, promising a company that would "harness the power of storytelling" and touch on "issues of race and class, democracy and civil rights, and much more."
"American Factory," the first title from Higher Ground, is available now on the streaming service. It manages to make good on the Obamas' pledge, which is a promising sign for what's to come.
The documentary, which won a directing award this year at the Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of a Chinese billionaire who opens a glass factory in a former General Motors plant in Dayton, Ohio, and hires both American and Chinese workers. The film looks at how their cultures clash (with the Chinese workers getting lessons in how Americans are overconfident and need to be praised), how the workers are taken advantage of by management (they're convinced not to join a union for the security of their jobs) and how automation could take many of their jobs.
Through the emotional stories of some of the workers, and even the billionaire chairman himself, the documentary winds up being funny, shocking, upsetting and eye-opening. The film works well without a central narrator, allowing the people themselves to tell their stories. There also plenty of How did they get that?! insider footage, courtesy of Dayton-based co-filmmakers Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar.
At almost two hours, the documentary doesn't drag. Instead, it sets an impressive precedent for the Obamas' forthcoming projects.
What else does Higher Ground have in the works?
Here's what's planned so far:
A drama series about the fashion world: "Bloom" will show the struggles faced by women of color in post-World War II New York. It's written and produced by Academy Award winner Callie Khouri ("Thelma & Louise").
A biopic about Frederick Douglass: Higher Ground plans to adapt the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography "Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom" into a movie about the abolitionist and statesman who was born into slavery.
An anthology series about unnoticed deaths: "Overlooked" will be a scripted show adapted from The New York Times' column of the same name that looks to correct the issue of obituaries primarily being written about white men.
A traveling kids' food show: "Listen to Your Vegetables & Eat Your Parents" is a half-hour preschool series from creators Jeremy Konner ("Drunk History") and Erika Thormahlen that will tell the story of food.
A Michael Lewis nonfiction series: The show will be based on "The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy," the book by the best-selling "Moneyball" and "The Big Short" writer about everyday heroes safeguarding the nation.
A documentary about camp for disabled teenagers: "Crip Camp" will tell the story of how a ramshackle summer camp down the road from Woodstock transformed young lives in the early '70s.

Texto completo: ILIE CONTENTIOSUS John McEnroe def. Ilie Nastase, 1979 None of the raucous nights at the U.S. Open can top the chaos of McEnroe's 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 second-round win over Nastase in 1979. As Neil Amdur wrote in The New York Times, "There were cheers, boos, point penalties, game penalties, police on the court, a switch in umpires and even some brilliant shot making." It ended at 12:36 a.m., but it could have ended earlier because the chair umpire, Frank Hammond, tried to default Nastase in the middle of the fourth set for unsportsmanlike conduct. That led to a delay of nearly 20 minutes as fans booed loudly, ran on the court and threw garbage at Hammond, who was eventually replaced by the tournament referee so the match could finish. SATURNUS MAJOR AND MINOR Martina Navratilova def. Chris Evert, John McEnroe def. Jimmy Connors, 1984 Sept. 8, 1984, when play began at Louis Armstrong Stadium at 11:07 a.m. and ended at 11:15 p.m., is considered one of the greatest single days of tennis. All four matches on that Super Saturday went the maximum number of sets. As night began to fall, Navratilova beat Evert, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, for the women's title. (It wasn't officially a night match, but Navratilova was 14-0 under the lights at the Open.) Then fans were treated to another legendary rivalry as McEnroe ousted Connors, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, in a men's semifinal. It turned out to be their last match against each other at the Open. CELEBRATIO! Jimmy Connors def. Patrick McEnroe, 1991 Connors's run to the semifinals in 1991, when he was 39 and ranked 174th, was full of instant classic moments, many at night. It all started with his first-round match against McEnroe, which began around 9:15 p.m. on Aug. 28. Connors lost the first two sets and was down by 0-3, 0-40 in the third. But by 1:35 a.m. on Aug. 29, Connors was the winner, 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-2, 6-4. He celebrated by pointing around the stadium to the thousands of fans who had stayed to watch. SERENA ET VENUS Venus Williams def. Serena Williams, 2001 Serena won the Open in 1999, and Venus did in 2000. The success and popularity of the sisters spurred the U.S.T.A. and CBS to move the women's singles final to prime time in 2001. The tournament was rewarded with Venus and Serena meeting in a Grand Slam final for the first time. Venus's 6-2, 6-4 victory was watched by 22.7 million people. The women's final was held in prime time for the next nine years. ADVERSARII Pete Sampras def. Andre Agassi, 2001 Of the 34 career meetings between Sampras and Agassi, only one was a night match at the U.S. Open. And it was a classic: a 6-7 (7), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5) victory by Sampras in the quarterfinals in 2001. Sampras, whose career ended a year later, was 20-0 in night matches at the Open. JUSTINE EXHAUSTA Justine Henin-Hardenne def. Jennifer Capriati, 2003 In the 2003 semifinals, Capriati was crafting a classic Open match of her own with "a fistclenching, linesman-berating, winner-on-therun performance," wrote Christopher Clarey of The Times. But it was missing one essential element: She didn't win. Instead, Henin-Hardenne, whose legs were cramping deep in the third set, prevailed, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4), at 12:27 a.m. Capriati rallied from 1-4 to win the first set, and Henin-Hardenne came back from 3-5 in the second and 2-5 in the third. Eleven times, Capriati was two points from victory. Less than 24 hours later, Henin-Hardenne beat Kim Clijsters for the title. FAMILIA CLIJSTERS Kim Clijsters def. Caroline Wozniacki, 2009 Clijsters, struggling with injuries, had retired at 23 in May 2007. She returned to the tour about a month before the 2009 U.S. Open, and then won it to become the first mother since Evonne Goolagong in 1980 to claim a major championship. After Clijsters received the trophy, her 18-month-old daughter, Jada, walked on court to join her. NOX LONGA Latest finish: 2:26 a.m. In one of the great oddities in the U.S. Open record book, there is a three-way tie, at 2:26 a.m., for the latest finish of a night match. The record is shared by Kei Nishikori's fourth-round win over Milos Raonic in 2014, Philipp Kohlschreiber's third-round victory over John Isner in 2012 and Mats Wilander's secondround defeat of Mikael Pernfors in 1993. FED INCREDIBILIS Roger Federer, champion, 2004-8 Federer is tied with Sampras and Connors for most singles titles in New York in the Open era, with five. And he won them consecutively, from 2004 to 2008. Across 18 Opens, Federer, 38, has played more night matches than any other man: 38, winning 35. RAFA REX Rafael Nadal def. Dominic Thiem, 2018 Nadal has won the U.S. Open three times, and he also owns three of the eight latest finishes in tournament history, including his five-set quarterfinal victory over Dominic Thiem last year that ended at 2:03 a.m.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Every year, The New York Times's Sports desk prominently covers the United States Open tennis tournament. This year, in a special section in today's paper, The Times celebrates the tournament's history of matches played at night -- a fitting topic for the paper of record in the city that never sleeps. Andrea Zagata, an art director for The Times, knew she wanted an illustration to depict 10 of the biggest moments under the lights in Queens, New York.
While playing under the lights isn't completely unique to New York, the writer Joel Drucker explains in the section that the "lights were part of the game's great transformation in the 1970s, which would loudly bring tennis from the dainty periphery to the sizzling center."

The illustrated highlights took place from 1979 to 2018. Given that photography technology has developed greatly within that time, Ms. Zagata thought an illustration would equalize the moments in a way that photos couldn't.

The space to fill was 44 inches wide and 19.2 inches high, about the size of an average miniature fridge (the largest single illustration to run in the newspaper, according to Ms. Zagata). In addition, there was a cover illustration of 11.55 inches by 19.4 inches. The deadline? Just under two and a half weeks.
"I really wanted someone that I was super comfortable working with," Ms. Zagata said.
Chris Buzelli, a New York City-based artist who has produced more than 20 illustrations for The Times over nearly 15 years, was the illustrator for the job.
But it would be a squeeze. Mr. Buzelli, 46, hand-paints all his work using oils, which typically take longer than other paints to dry. Plus, he had several other projects in the works. He hesitated before accepting the job.
"I'm a freelance illustrator; sometimes it's like feast or famine, and I was in feast at that point," Mr. Buzelli said.
He added that this project would require greater research than usual, always his first step when undertaking a project. Before Ms. Zagata emailed him, he said, he had never even heard of night tennis.
He credits Ms. Zagata for her work in compiling reference materials of the 10 moments. This big lift gave Mr. Buzelli the head start he needed to complete the project in time.
Mr. Buzelli typically presents three concepts to his clients. This time, he immediately had the idea of using a constellation map to depict the moments, including John McEnroe's defeat of Ilie Nastase in 1979; Venus Williams's defeat of her sister in 2001 (a match that paved the way for the women's final to be held in prime time for the next nine years); and the three-way tie for the latest finish of a night match, which is 2:26 a.m. Ms. Zagata was fully on board with the concept.
So Mr. Buzelli got to work at his studio located in New York City, where he lives with his wife, SooJin, who is also an artist, and their miniature pinscher, Minnesota.
He started off with rough sketches before translating the portraits to two gesso boards, which are Masonite panels with a preapplied base coat.
"Illustration is a funny thing," Mr. Buzelli said. "It's much different than just creating art."
"There's a very blurry line between both. Illustration, that genesis comes from outside," he added. "Art's a little bit different. It comes a little bit more from yourself."
He tries to merge the two by adding a bit of himself into his work.
"Even though the genesis is night tennis, I really love constellations and things that glow," he said. His maternal grandfather was in the United States Navy, and Mr. Buzelli recalls him often naming the stars to him when he was a child.
Mr. Buzelli graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1995 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in illustration, but his illustrating career really started about a decade after. After teaching part-time while toiling as an artist, his big break came when he got a call to create a piece for the coveted album review illustration for Rolling Stone magazine. It was for the album "A One Way Ticket to Hell ... and Back," by The Darkness.
"Which, in my industry is kind of a really sweet gig to get," he said. "And I had all but given up on it."
Now, it is safe to say Mr. Buzelli's career is in full swing. Last summer, Ms. Zagata also tapped him to illustrate our U.S. Open coverage, a Sports cover portrait of tennis player Sloane Stephens. "The Creative Marriage of Words and Images," an exhibition by Mr. and Mrs. Buzelli, is showing at the ISB Gallery in Providence, R.I., until Oct. 19. Mr. Buzelli also teaches once a week at his alma mater and at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
Ms. Zagata said that Mr. Buzelli's work fit the reverent mood of what the project set out to accomplish for tennis fans, "which is to look back in history and give people a keepsake," she said. "And if you don't love tennis, you have something you can sit with for a while and learn."

Texto completo: Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston in August 2017, forcing tens of thousands of people out of their homes and stranding others on roofs and porches. Millions watched the disaster unfold on their television screens, but one group sprang into action. The "Cajun Navy" - boat owners from Louisiana, many of whom had endured the ravages of Hurricane Katrina - hitched all manner of watercraft (bass boats, air boats) to their vehicles, drove to Texas and set about rescuing thousands of residents. The informal group, which coordinates using social media, has also traveled to North Carolina and Florida to help flood victims.
Why do some people feel compassion, and act, when they hear about mass human suffering, while others put the distress out of their minds and go back to their daily business? The question has long drawn the attention of psychologists and philosophers, not to mention activists looking for ways to get people off their sofas (or to open their wallets) when tragedy strikes - or when governments commit unethical acts.
In the case of the Cajun Navy, one easy answer might be that its members were primed to act because, as Katrina survivors, they had experienced a blow like that endured by Harvey's victims. Shared pain, the argument goes, insulated them from some of the "bugs" of human compassion, notably the tendency to be moved deeply by a single, identifiable victim (a man or woman drowning) but to respond more blandly as the scale of a tragedy grows (a city underwater).
But as a method for increasing compassion, empathy-through-adversity is a highly unsatisfying solution, since it means that the way to warm people's hearts is to make them suffer first. Fortunately, shared pain, by itself, isn't what makes the difference, according to new research from my lab led by Daniel Lim. More specifically, people who have undergone adversity have a greater sense of efficacy when it comes to helping others. Through their own harsh experiences, they've come to believe that even small acts of kindness have an impact on those in need. "The best way you can thank somebody for helping you is to go help somebody else," an engineer and Cajun Navy member named Ben Theriot told the New York Times during Harvey.
As luck would have it, we can disentangle these two factors. To help people become more compassionate, we can convince them that their efforts to aid others can make a difference, as opposed to waiting for them to be struck by adversity themselves. The research suggests that doing so will make them more willing to lend a hand in a crisis.
Our initial investigation found that past experience with adversity does have positive effects on compassion, without pinning down the mechanism. (It's not self-evident that this would be the case: An alternative hypothesis would be that adversity hardens the heart.) In one study, we asked more than 200 subjects about the severity of hardships they'd faced - loss of loved ones, serious illness, violence or similar tragic occurrences - and measured their compassion through their level of agreement with statements like, "It's important to take care of people who are vulnerable." People who had experienced adversity expressed more compassion than those who hadn't (as reflected in survey answers), were more willing to donate to the Red Cross at the end of the study, and were more willing to help complete tasks for someone else in the lab (an actor) who reported feeling ill.
Importantly, the type of adversity people had experienced didn't seem to matter: Someone who had been afflicted with a health crisis was as likely to feel compassion for another person living through the aftermath of a natural disaster as they were for someone facing health problems.
More recently, we zeroed in on whether past adversity helps to counteract the failure of compassion to grow as the scale of a tragedy increases, a tendency called "compassion fade" that is well established in the psychological literature and that is famously captured by a saying often attributed to Stalin: "One death is a tragedy. A million deaths is just a statistic." In several experiments involving hundreds of participants, we presented people with images of, and information about, a single child suffering as a result of the conflict in Darfur - or eight children. We also asked those people about personal crises they'd faced. Those who had experienced little or no adversity in life reacted to the two presentations roughly equally, but those who had faced significant adversity (the top third of the sample) expressed levels of compassionate concern that were about 20 percent greater when the number of suffering children rose.
Compassion may shut down as tragedy expands because people feel overwhelmed and helpless, so we wondered whether people who had experienced more adversity in life might be more convinced that their altruistic acts are effective. In our experiments, we specifically asked people if they thought they could make a difference in the lives of the Sudanese children. As expected, those who had experienced greater adversity reported a stronger belief that even small actions could matter. Moreover, this belief directly predicted how much compassion they felt - and, when we gave them the opportunity, how much more money they were willing to donate to charities like UNICEF to help such children. In fact, those who had experienced adversity gave more than double the amount of their low-adversity peers.
To be certain that belief about efficacy was the ingredient that mattered, we intervened, in a study involving 98 participants, to change people's views on that question. We administered a bogus empathy test to people who had little experience of adversity in their lives and told them that the results revealed they were "good at caring for others and … more successful in alleviating their pain." That false feedback changed their self-reported belief in the effectiveness of their actions; it also changed their reactions as the number of suffering Darfur children grew. Now the low-adversity group, too - just like those who had gone through tough times - grew more concerned when there were more victims.
The upshot is straightforward but profound. Yes, those who have faced adversity in life are more immune to the pernicious compassion fade that plagues the human response to mass suffering - the impulse to weep over a photo of a Salvadoran father and daughter who died attempting to cross the Rio Grande, for example, but to tune out news stories about the mistreatment of thousands of people in border facilities.
But it's not suffering per se that produces this immunity: It's that those who experience hardship come to believe that even small actions like donating modest sums, or offering to listen or to help even one victim, can make a difference for people in distress. And that should give us hope, because if that belief is adopted by enough people, the resources needed to address problems at larger scales will start to flow.
The best way to change people's minds on this question, of course, isn't through providing false feedback, as we did in our experiment, but rather by offering opportunities to witness firsthand and, better yet, experience the power of helping. Both those who receive assistance during personal crises and natural disasters, and those who give it, palpably perceive its effectiveness. Whether through encouraging volunteerism, or having volunteers spread the word that even small acts of compassion can have a large collective impact, giving people a sense of empowerment in the face of tragedy will help reduce their tendency to turn away. Simply watching others help on television isn't enough; people need to see altruism up close to become convinced of its efficacy.
People who have suffered do possess wisdom that lets them overcome the paralysis produced by compassion fade - but fortunately, that wisdom is available to all of us.

Texto completo: Rick Gates, the former business partner of Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, has testified that former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig helped spin a report in the media on behalf of the Kremlin-linked Ukrainian government.
The Justice Department’s case against Craig, 74, stems from Robert Mueller’s special counsel investigation. It focuses on the public relations work performed for Ukraine by Craig and the law firm he worked for — Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher, and Flom — throughout 2012.
Manafort, found guilty of tax and bank fraud and other violations, worked alongside Gates to assist President Viktor Yanukovych. Skadden and Craig worked out a deal with Manafort for a report on Ukraine’s controversial prosecution of former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.
Gates, 47, who is cooperating with the government following a guilty plea related to conspiracy and false statements, took the stand Thursday for the first time since testifying against Manafort last year.
Craig maintains Skadden put together an independent report, and his lawyers deny his involvement in the media rollout plans by Gates and Jonathan Hawker, the British publicist who was brought on by Manafort to shape a pro-Yanukovych media narrative. Prosecutors say Craig initially sought advice about whether he’d need to register under the law if he took the job writing the report and that a colleague advised him writing a report would be fine, but doing public relations work would not.
Gates claimed that, months before the report was released, Craig suggested David Sanger of the New York Times as who should get the report. Craig later offered Sanger the report, hand-delivered a copy to his home, and did an interview with him and other reporters.
Craig is charged with misleading investigators about his role promoting the report at the behest of the Ukrainian government. The "scheme" relates to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which mandates anyone working on behalf of a foreign government register with DOJ.
Gates detailed the plan to “seed” the report with a trusted journalist before it was released, claiming “most of the other reporters would follow the first article.” Gates said the overall plan was a “living breathing document” but “the strategy never changed about seeding the report.”
And Gates says Craig proposed the journalist who they eventually decided to go with and that Craig worked with the reporter on the article.
“Mr. Craig had named a reporter from the New York Times who might be interested in writing this and that he’d be willing to reach out to about this,” Gates testified. “He said Mr. Sanger is a tough but fair reporter and we wouldn’t necessarily get a positive article — but we’d get a credible article.”
Gates further testified that “the overall strategy worked” thanks to Craig suggesting Sanger.
“The article wasn’t the greatest but it was viewed neutrally, so it did have an impact,” Gates claimed.
The article, published in late 2012, was headlined “Failings Found in Trial of Ukrainian Ex-Premier.” It listed some flaws in the prosecution, but Sanger wrote that “overall” the report “seemed to side heavily with the government.”
“They [Skadden] found no evidence in the trial record to support to her [Tymoshenko's] main contention: that her prosecution was a politically motivated effort by Mr. Yanukovich,” Sanger wrote.
When asked why Sanger’s name rarely appeared in the plans, Craig claimed that “Mr. Manafort asked me to keep Mr. Sanger’s name off of material going back and forth” between himself and the other lobbying groups they’d involved, including the Podesta Group.
Craig told prosecutors Manafort picked Skadden because it was “viewed as a credible Western firm.” Gates said Craig was brought on because he was a “credible attorney” who could help sell the trustworthiness of the report.
When investigators saw media coverage of the report and the role Skadden played, DOJ questioned Craig about whether he should have registered as an agent of Ukraine. Prosecutors say he concealed facts because he thought registering would’ve harmed his career prospects.
Craig's attorneys argue he spoke with the media only due to his fears Ukraine was whitewashing the report. “I agreed to tell the truth,” Gates said in explaining his plea deal. “And I agreed to help with any other cases they were working on.”
Gates said he’s met with investigators “at least 40 times.”
The defense grilled Gates about the alleged crimes he’d committed, getting him to admit he’d lied to to the IRS, Visa, Ukraine, and a bank in Cyprus, among others. Gates also admitted he stole money from Manafort, but denied allegations of insider trading. He also said he never made any false income claims related to Trump's campaign.
Gates admitted the media rollout plans proposing Craig meet with global leaders and conduct media round tables were never approved by Craig.
Hawker testified earlier this week he referred to Gates as “prick” (an apparent play on "Rick") and compared getting paid by Manafort and Gates to “trying to grab eels with your hands.” He said Craig was willing to speak with members of the media about the Skadden report.
Jurors this week were also shown a $1.25 million invoice which Craig backdated at Manafort’s behest to accommodate Ukraine. Skadden’s chief financial officer testified it was “not our standard practice” for Craig to issue invoices like that. Craig’s defense attorney addressed this issue in opening statements, saying Craig admitted it was a mistake.
Craig told Manafort “you rock” in another email after confirming a wire transfer.
The prosecution is expected to finish its side of the case Friday or Monday. Heather Hunt, former leader of DOJ’s FARA unit, hasn’t testified yet.
Craig faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted.
Viktor Pinchuk, a Ukrainian oligarch, paid over $4 million for the project, despite Ukraine initially claiming Skadden was hired for $12,000. Skadden settled with the federal government in January and relinquished $4.6 million, the amount it was paid for its report.

Texto completo: [Wackadoodle]
On Monday, after President Trump tweeted the unfounded assertion that Google had somehow "manipulated" millions of votes in favor of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, CNN chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin
said, "In a day of wackadoodle claims, this is the most wackadoodle of all, because there is not even any claim that Google manipulated votes." He added, "No one claims that except Donald Trump."
"Wackadoodle," also spelled as "whackadoodle," has emerged as a humorous label for someone or something that is eccentric at best or unhinged at worst. In 2014, the word entered the Oxford English Dictionary, along with its shorter form, "wackadoo." Katherine Martin, head of U.S. dictionaries for Oxford University Press, observed that, for both "wackadoo" and "wackadoodle," "the silliness of the words themselves contributes to their mildly contemptuous effect."
The roots of these words can be found in their first syllable. "Whack" goes back to the 18th century as a noun or verb referring to a vigorous blow -- probably a case of onomatopoeia, like the similarly aggressive "thwack." "Whack" gave rise to many different expressions, like "taking a whack" at something. "In fine whack" once meant "in good condition," while "out of whack" described something that's malfunctioning, including someone's mental faculties. The Ishmaelite, a newspaper in Erie, Kan., included an item in March 1871 describing a local character as "one of that sort of fellows whose heart is in the right place" but whose "head is awfully out of 'whack.'"
In the 20th century, "whacky" or "wacky" came to describe an "out of whack" personality -- perhaps suggesting that someone needed a whack to the head to be set straight. "Whacko" or "wacko" became popularized as a term for an eccentric person, as in this 1936 passage from the State Journal of Lansing, Mich., describing a search for a fall guy: "They've got to pick some whacko who won't want the state capital building in return for false imprisonment."
Elaborating "wacky" into the longer words "wackadoo" and "wackadoodle" may have been helped along by nonsensical refrains in songs going back to the 1920s. "Doo Wacka Doo" was a song title in 1924, and the singer-songwriter Roger Miller had a hit with the similarly titled "Do-Wacka-Do" in 1965. The "doodle" variation appears as early as 1933 in a song titled "The King Made Whoopee in the Land of Whack-a-Doodle-Doo."
"Whack-a-doodle-doo," of course, resembles the rooster's cry of "cock-a-doodle-doo," which shows up in texts dating back to Shakespeare's time. The "doodle" element has long been used to connote foolishness: The song "Yankee Doodle" is based on a sneering epithet that the British used against American colonists, who were seen as objects of ridicule (especially when they tried to put on airs as "dandies").
Combining all these fanciful components into "wackadoodle" didn't become popular until the early 1990s. The Oxford English Dictionary notes that the humorist Dave Barry wrote a column in 1991 with a list of silly names for "traditional English dishes," including "Whack-a-Doodle Johnson," and a 1993 article in the San Diego Tribune quoted a therapist referring to "wack-a-doodle theories of psychology."
The term is also showing up in our Trump-era politics. New York Times columnist David Brooks recently said on the "PBS NewsHour" that Marianne Williamson, the self-help guru now running for the Democratic presidential nomination, has some "wackadoodle ideas." And in March, President Trump's proposed budget was called "heartless and whackadoodle" by Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell. When the times feel particularly ludicrous, only the most ludicrous terms suffice.

Massachusetts's Moulton ends presidential run, will seek reelection to House

Texto completo: Rep. Seth Moulton (Mass.), a Harvard-educated Marine veteran who struggled to gain traction in a crowded Democratic presidential field, announced Friday that he would close his campaign, making him the third candidate to depart the race in the past eight days.
"I am ending my campaign for president," Moulton said in a Friday speech in San Francisco at the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting. "Though this campaign is not ending the way we hoped, I am leaving this race knowing that we raised issues that are vitally important."
Moulton argued that his veterans-focused campaign challenged President Trump "where he's weakest, as commander in chief," and worked to "take back patriotism from the Republican Party."
The congressman attracted as much attention as he had since his April presidential debut on his concluding day, when Trump sought to blame him for a stock market slump that followed the president's belligerent tweets about his handpicked Federal Reserve chief and his trade nemesis, China.
"The Dow is down 573 points perhaps on the news that Representative Seth Moulton, whoever that may be, has dropped out of the 2020 Presidential Race!" Trump tweeted.
Moulton follows Washington Gov. Jay Inslee and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, two Democrats who shuttered their bids for the White House in recent days as the nomination contest moves toward the fall - and as the DNC imposes stricter requirements for a spot at upcoming debates.
Inslee announced he would instead seek a third gubernatorial term next year, and Hickenlooper announced he would run against Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Moulton said Friday that he would seek reelection to the House in Massachusetts's 6th Congressional District near Boston.
"I can't wait to get back at it," Moulton said in his speech. Moulton's exit from the 2020 race was first reported by the New York Times.
Moulton, 40, had been lingering near 1 percent or less in the polls and failed to qualify for the first two debates, in June and July. By early August, his campaign staff began to shrink following fundraising difficulties.
Despite the disappointment, Moulton told the DNC members that he walks away from the race proud of the way he shined a light on veterans' issues and his own hardships. Moulton served as a Marine Corps captain during the Iraq War and was the recipient of a Bronze Star.
"For the first time in my life, I talked publicly about dealing with post-traumatic stress from my four combat tours in Iraq," Moulton said. He called those discussions part of an effort to end "the stigma around mental health."
Moulton's low-key presence on the campaign trail, however, did little to win him notice.
"I'm not going around doing crazy things just looking for a viral moment," Moulton said at a Washington Post Live event in June. "The case I'm making to the American people is that I'm not a crazy leader. I'm someone that you can trust, and you're not going to agree with me on everything."
In an interview with The Washington Post, Moulton said that "getting in late to the race was a handicap, much worse than expected. If I had gotten in even just a few weeks earlier, I probably would have made the first debate."
But by waiting until April 22, Moulton joined a field that already had 18 candidates and was the most crowded primary in the party's modern history. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, in particular, was surging at the time, and his presence made it harder for Moulton since they both were running on themes related to generational change and military experience.
Moulton said in The Post interview that he has had private conversations this month with former vice president Joe Biden, who leads the polls. Their latest exchange came Thursday, he said.
While Moulton is not ready to make an endorsement, he identifies with Biden's pragmatic politics.
"I do think that Trump is going to be hard to beat," Moulton said. "I think Vice President Biden would make a fantastic president. He's a mentor and a friend, and I've been impressed by the campaign he has run so far."
Moulton added, "It's evident now that this is essentially a three-way race" among Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Moulton said he worries that "veering too far left could lose us this election" and warned his party against embracing Medicare-for-all proposals on health care.
"I think we should strengthen Obamacare and have a robust public option that can compete against private plans," Moulton said, echoing Biden's approach. "I don't think we should just take people off of that."
Moulton is also known as a political rebel in the House, where he co-organized an effort to stop Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) from winning the speaker's gavel.
He rejected the suggestion that his work against Pelosi's speaker bid - he eventually supported her after weeks of talks - hurt his 2020 campaign.
"It's basically Washington reporters who care about that," Moulton said. "I've not met a single voter outside of Washington who says to me, 'Seth, I wish you'd be a little more establishment and follow what your party leaders are telling you to do.' It's absurd."
Moulton said he and Pelosi still have differences, including the party's timeline for possibly impeaching Trump. Moulton wants the impeachment process to begin immediately and said Pelosi is making a "big mistake" by waiting to formally begin those proceedings.
Moulton plans to stay active in national politics in the coming months with events for veterans and for fellow Democrats through his Serve America PAC.
On Monday, Moulton will host a veterans' town hall meeting in Fairfax, Va., with retired Army Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
"I'm not going anywhere. I'm only 40 years old," Moulton said in the interview with a chuckle.

Texto completo: Washington • Hours after Beijing said it would increase tariffs on U.S. goods in response to President Donald Trump’s latest round of Chinese levies, the president ordered companies in the United States to stop doing business with China and warned of additional retaliation.
In a series of angry Twitter posts, Trump said “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing our companies HOME and making your products in the USA.”
The president also said he was ordering the U.S. Postal Service and private companies like FedEx, Amazon and UPS to search packages from China for the opioid fentanyl and refuse delivery.
“We don’t need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them,” Trump said on Twitter. “The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP.”
It was not yet clear on Friday how Trump planned to carry out his demands, including ordering companies to begin seeking alternatives to China. Trump has routinely urged U.S. companies to stop doing business in China and has viewed his tariffs as a way to prod them to move production. While some companies have begun looking for other places to locate their supply chains, including Vietnam, many businesses — particularly smaller ones — say such a move is costly, time-consuming and could put them out of business.
The escalation in the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies came as China said it would raise tariffs on $75 billion worth of U.S.-made goods, including crude oil, cars and farm products, if Trump carries through with his plan to tax an additional $300 billion worth of imports. The exchange was a sign that neither side is ready to back down from an economic conflict that has already begun to slow global growth.
China’s plan to retaliate, which was announced late on Friday in Beijing, includes putting new tariffs of 5% or 10% on U.S. goods. Like Trump’s threatened tariffs on Chinese goods, China’s new tariffs would take effect in two stages, the first on Sept. 1 and the second on Dec. 15.
The news was likely to unnerve investors who worry that the trade war between the world’s two largest economies will drag down global growth. Markets fell on the news in afternoon trading in Europe, and the S&P 500 was down nearly 2% in early afternoon trading.
Trump’s anger was compounded by remarks from the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, who did not signal another imminent rate cut and said the central bank’s ability to counteract the president’s trade war was limited. Trump criticized Powell on Twitter, suggesting he was as much an enemy as Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?,” the president tweeted.
“I think China’s trying to show that, cooperation or fight, it is ready to do both and it is not going to be pressured into an unfavorable trade deal,” said Andy Mok, a trade and geopolitics specialist at the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing.
Mok said that China’s willingness to impose a tariff on imports of crude oil from the United States, even though China needs a lot of imported oil, shows Beijing’s determination. “One way you show your seriousness in a negotiation is to show you’re willing to incur costs,” he said.
The State Council Tariff Commission in Beijing said that the tariffs were a response to Trump’s threat to impose new tariffs by Sept. 1. Trump had initially said he would impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion in Chinese-made goods on that date, essentially targeting everything that the United States buys from China that has not already been hit by previous rounds of tariffs. He later delayed more than half of the latest round of tariffs until Dec. 15 to avoid hitting American pocketbooks during the holiday shopping season. A few tariffs were scrapped entirely.
Peter Navarro, director of the White House’s Office of Trade and Manufacturing, said on the Fox Business Network that China’s move was to be expected and that it would only galvanize support for Trump’s tough approach to China in the United States.
“I just think that the way that China is reacting to this whole thing is simply reinforcing America’s perception of China as a bad actor,” Navarro said. “When China tries to bully us, that only strengthens our resolve.”
Navarro said the new tariffs that China was imposing were just a sliver of the overall United States economy and that they should not impact growth. He said that actions by central banks to cut interest rates were more significant to the global economy than the trade dispute between the United States and China.
Navarro added that he expected the negotiations between the United States and China would continue despite the escalation.
“We’re going to resume those talks in September,” he said.
Both sides have a lot at stake. Recent market moves have signaled that many investors expect the U.S. economy to slide into recession in the future, with the trade war as a major reason.
The Chinese government has its own worries. The country’s economic growth is already slowing. Though the Chinese government keeps tight control over the country’s economy and still has a lot of financial firepower at its disposal to help growth, a huge and growing debt problem has limited its options.

DON'T WEAPONIZE SCHOOL LUNCHES LUNCH SHAMING SHOULD BE A THING OF THE PAST, NO MATTER THE COST

Texto completo: I was working my way through the school lunch line with my elementary-aged daughter who was giddy with delight at the prospect of Mum's noon-time visit. It was a once-a-year perk from our neighborhood school, the occasion being the celebration of her birthday.
I can't remember the meal she and I were served. But I remember vividly the meal that was given to the little boy in front of me in the line.
Two pieces of bread, two slices of American cheese, an apple and a carton of milk.
It wasn't his meal of choice.
Like my daughter and I, he had collected the hot meal of the day (whatever it was) and had proceeded to the checkout where he was informed in hushed tones there was no money in his lunch account. His hot-meal tray was taken away and he was given the "alternative meal."
His eyes welled with tears.
I think I asked to pay for his hot lunch but, so profound was my shock at what had unfolded, I don't remember for certain if that's what I did or just what I wished I had done.
And while some memories fade with time, my mental image of this child's eyes brimming with tears - a memory from more than a decade ago - remains crystal clear.
...
There is actually a name for this school-endorsed slap-in-a-little-kid's-face.
It's called "lunch shaming."
Specifics vary from place to place across the country. But the overriding theme is this: Kids with empty lunch accounts or those who have run a deficit that exceeds a certain dollar amount are denied that day's hot lunch. (I haven't heard of any schools that send the kid away with nothing on his tray. Though who knows how many youngsters avoid the lunch line and the humiliation altogether and simply go hungry?) Some schools give an alternative meal - usually a cold sandwich, some milk, a fruit or some cut-up veggies. Others require that the kid work off his debt by cleaning up in the cafeteria.
I got to remembering my own encounter with lunch shaming when, a few weeks back, a school district in Luzerne County in northeastern Pennsylvania made headlines by sending letters to a few dozen parents of children whose lunch accounts were in arrears. The letters threatened to report the parents to the local child welfare agency for neglect, the premise being that the parents weren't providing food for their child. The specter of foster care placement loomed.
Are you kidding me?
The crisis was averted when a well-off businessman cleared the students' debt.
I started poking around on the internet and talking to some friends and I found out this is a "thing."
And while it's easy to cast the school district or the food service manager or the lunch ladies as the villains in this story, "easy" isn't "right." Unpaid lunches by students who do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals can add up to a significant deficit for lunch programs that are expected to be self-sustaining.
...
Curtistine Walker has been around long enough as food service manager for Pittsburgh Public Schools to recall some years back when the district's policy keyed on alternative meals for students who owed the district for their lunches. It's not an issue in PPS now because the district has so many children who qualify for free or reduced-price meals that the entire district can participate in a program that gives free lunches to everybody.
Still, Ms. Walker remembers keenly the situation she faced as the manager of the program. She told me that by March of each school year, in the elementary lunch program alone, the balance owed hovered around a quarter-million dollars. It was an amount that risked the financial stability of the entire program, she said.
And while Ms. Walker said she didn't like the idea of denying a hot lunch to any kid, she said no one was sent away hungry. "We wouldn't do that. But, unfortunately, a lot of parents counted on that. They gamed the system. They'd call me and tell me we could keep sending them bills but that they weren't going to pay because they knew we'd feed their child no matter what."
...
I rang up my school district a few days ago to talk about the lunch shaming I had witnessed back when. I was curious if that protocol remained in place today. Within a few minutes of my leaving a message, I got a callback from Seneca Valley district Superintendent Tracy Vitale who set things straight from the onset: That's not how things roll now.
Ms. Vitale, herself a parent, was downright passionate in her anathema for lunch shaming.
Describing herself as "hypersensitive" to the topic, she said she made it clear from her get-go as superintendent about a decade ago that "I don't ever want a kid to ever not have a hot meal in this district."
Alternative lunches? SV doesn't do them. "It's as simple as that," she said.
Are there kids with lunch accounts that run a deficit? Yes. But Ms. Vitale has solved that problem by creating a fund to cover those deficits. At the end of each year, any student leaving the district who has a balance owed to his family is asked if he or she is willing to donate it to cover the costs of those who have been unable to pay. "The answer is almost always yes," she said.
And if there is a deficit anyway, Ms. Vitale said she'd find a way. "We will not engage in lunch shaming. We're just not going to do it."
Why?
Ms. Vitale articulated two reasons and they follow, paraphrased:
1) If we want kids to do well in the classroom, they need to eat. And if they're too embarrassed to go through the lunch line, they may skip the meal.
2) Kids are kids, not adults. It's not their fault if their parents didn't pay the bill. And a lot of time it's not even the parents' fault. It could have been oversight. It could be a technical error on our end. There could have been a sudden change in the family's financial well-being.
Some people will argue that Seneca is in the luxurious position of having a comparatively low percentage of families that struggle. Of some 7,500 students district-wide, only about 17% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals.
Ms. Vitale is unbending.
"This is an adult issue. Not a child issue. This is simple. This is just money. A district has to just figure it out."
She believes the U.S. should follow the lead of some European countries that provide free meals to students. But, short of that, Ms. Vitale said she'd all but make a deal with the devil to ensure that no child ever is lunch shamed or ever goes hungry. "I'd reach out to churches. I'd go to community groups. Whatever it takes," she said.
...
I sympathize with the food service managers tasked with balancing budgets and ensuring each kid gets a nutritious lunch every day.
But this I know:
Snatching a hot meal from a hungry kid and making him walk away from the lunch line with an "alternative" risks unforgettable humiliation and amounts to school-sanctioned bullying. A child is not responsible for paying his family's bills. A child needs to eat. The sins of the father should not be visited on the son.
In sum, school lunches shouldn't be weaponized.

Texto completo: When Barack Obama was president and the economic statistics were good, then-candidate Donald Trump said they were fake. When Trump became president and inherited the exact same stats, they suddenly became real.
Now that they're turning south, they're apparently fake once more.
Trump, aided by his economic brain trust of cranks and sycophants, believes any indicator showing the U.S. economy could be in trouble must be fabricated. It's all part of an anti-Trump conspiracy, he rants, according to reports in The Washington Post, the Associated Press and The New York Times.
And move over, Illuminati, because this particular conspiracy is massive .
It's led by the Federal Reserve, Democrats and the media, of course, or so say Trump and his Fox News minions. But it also includes the entire U.S. bond market, which flashed a warning sign last week when the Treasury yield curve inverted (meaning long-term bonds had lower interest rates than short-term ones, which usually predates a downturn).
Also colluding are the many farmers, retailers, manufacturers and economists who have been warning for more than a year that the burden of Trump's tariffs is mainly borne by Americans, not China or other trading partners, and also that uncertainty over trade tensions can paralyze hiring, investment and purchasing decisions, which we need to keep the economy expanding.
The cabal even transcends borders. Besides Trump's trade wars, after all, the main risk to the U.S. economy involves contagion from abroad. And right now, nine major economies are either in a recession or on the verge of one.
The White House has reportedly declined to develop contingency plans for a downturn because it doesn't want to validate this "negative narrative." This is, in a word, idiotic. As others have analogized, it's like refusing to buy a fire extinguisher because you're afraid of feeding a "negative narrative" that you might someday face a fire.
Administration officials decided the best way to deal with recession risk, which they of course aren't personally worried about, was through a show of force on TV. There, Trump's economic advisers assured Americans they definitely, certainly, cross-their-hearts-and-hope-to-die don't see reason to worry.
White House trade adviser Peter Navarro's strategy was to deny that the data show Americans are paying higher prices on tariffed goods (though we are) and also that the yield curve had recently inverted (though it did). On that latter point, Navarro said the curve was merely "flat" and therefore doesn't signal a possible recession. In virtually identical language across interviews, he told audiences that he had authority in this matter because he "didn't write the book on the yield curve," he wrote "several books on the efficacy of the yield curve as a leading economic indicator."
What Navarro failed to mention, though, is that these books say that both inverted and "flat" yield curves are usually signs of impending recession. One such book, from 2006, explicitly mocked business leaders for failing to prepare for the 2001 recession because they had ignored "the ominous progression of the yield curve" that began with the curve's flattening.
So, yeah, you can add mid-2000s-era Navarro to the list of anti-Trump conspirators, too.
Trump's National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow hit the Sunday shows, too. For his part, he bizarrely pretended other troubling economic data (in this case, on consumer sentiment) didn't exist. He also repeatedly told viewers: "Let's not be afraid of optimism."
And look, yes, it would be unhelpful for public officials to go on TV and tell everybody to panic, pull their money out of the market and stuff it under their mattresses. The White House obviously wants to project confidence instead.
But that confidence is convincing only if it's credible -- because, say, the White House has acknowledged how its own trade policies are contributing to recession risk and is committed to reversing them. Or because it has a competent team in place if recession strikes.
Neither is true.
Instead, Kudlow's call for optimism has a whiff of Peter Pan logic about it: If only we believe in fairies hard enough, we can always save Tinker Bell -- even when we're sending her out into a hailstorm. If you believe, clap your hands; don't let Tink die!
It's hard to imagine nervous Americans are really this credulous. Then again, perhaps we were never the intended audience for such performances. Sure, maybe White House aides are trying to fool the public into believing recession warning signs don't exist. But maybe they're actually just trying to fool their boss.
A frightening conspiracy theory, indeed.

Stephanie Grisham says New York Times 'weaponizing journalism' against Trump

Texto completo: White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham accused the New York Times of "weaponizing journalism" against President Trump.
Grisham lashed out at the news outlet, which her boss often dubs a purveyor of fake news, while commenting on the emergence of decade-old tweets from New York Times politics editor Tom Wright-Piersanti that have been criticized as offensive and racist.
“I am disgusted but not surprised by this latest revelation out of the New York Times,” Grisham said in a statement to Breitbart. “Will there be consequences? Doubtful. The New York Times is too busy weaponizing journalism to harass this President and the people who work for him to bother holding their own people accountable.”
Wright-Piersanti apologized for his "offensive" tweets, including one in 2010 that said "HAPPY Jew Year," on Thursday. "I am deeply sorry," he said.
New York Times spokeswoman Danielle Rhoades Ha told the Washington Examiner that they are "aware of these tweets, which are a clear violation of our standards." She added, "We are reviewing next steps."
This is not the first time the Times has dealt with controversial social media behavior by its employees. Last week, the New York Times demoted former deputy Washington editor Jonathan Weisman for "serious lapses in judgment" in recent Twitter posts.
In August 2018, New York Times editorial board member Sarah Jeong was found to have tweeted such messages as "Dumbass f---ing white people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants" as recent as 2014. The outlet took no action against Jeong, saying that she was "imitating the rhetoric of her harassers." The paper added that it does not condone Jeong's old tweets.
The statement from Grisham comes shortly after the Times published a piece headlined, "Stephanie Grisham’s Turbulent Ascent to a Top White House Role," which discusses how the 42-year-old divorced mother of two "has shown a willingness to publicly assail those who displease the president." Grisham, who was working as first lady Melania Trump's press secretary, took on the jobs of White House press secretary and communications director roughly two months ago.
It also follows Dean Baquet, the executive editor of the New York Times, saying recently the paper will shift the focus of its coverage from the Trump-Russia affair to Trump and race. "We built our newsroom to cover one story, and we did it truly well," he said. "Now we have to regroup, and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story."
Trump tweeted over the weekend that the Times has engaged in a "racist witch hunt."

Texto completo: “The son becomes the father, and the father, the son,” says Jor-El to his intergalactic offspring Kal-El in the original 1978 film version of Superman.
I thought of the wisdom of those words when I learned of the death last week of Peter Fonda. The actor, who was one of two children born to Henry Fonda and his second wife, Frances Seymour Brokaw, never exactly “became” his father on-screen. In fact, for much of his career, he seemed at pains to stand in opposition to his pop: Where Henry had become an icon for his expressions of manly dignity, Peter was known for boyish flamboyance in such films as The Trip (1967), Easy Rider (1969), and The Hired Hand (1971).
Late in his career, though, the son finally summoned the spirit of the father in Victor Nunez’s 1997 independent film Ulee’s Gold. Cast as an emotionally muted beekeeper beset by a good-for-nothing son and daughter-in-law, Fonda’s performance netted him his sole Oscar nomination as Best Actor.
A number of the reviews found traces of Henry in Peter’s performance. “With his intriguingly aged features, and a slow verbal delivery, he bears an uncanny resemblance to his famous father, Henry,” wrote Desson Howe in the Washington Post. In the New York Times, Janet Maslin referenced Clint Eastwood and John Wayne, too: “He conveys stubborn bitterness along with the inner strength of a man described by another of the film’s characters as ‘an old-fashioned, ties-that-bind kind of guy.'”
“Inner strength”? “Stubborn bitterness”? Well, that describes Henry, too. “When Henry Fonda said something,” wrote Peter Bogdanovich, “you believed it — whether spoken as a country boy or a playboy, college professor or criminal, sheriff, outlaw, architect, fisherman or hillbilly.” On the basis of such authenticity, Henry was the studios’ pick to play a gallery of noble icons, real and fictitious, including Abe Lincoln (1939’s Young Mr. Lincoln) and Tom Joad (1940’s The Grapes of Wrath). In fact, Henry was so synonymous with rectitude and restraint that his straitlaced ways were playfully parodied in Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s comic Western There Was a Crooked Man ... (1970), in which he starred as a high-minded prison warden mercilessly needled by a group of rascally felons.
In truth, Peter, along with his sister, Jane, frequently seemed to pick parts seemingly designed to shock fans of their father. Jane kicked off her career as a peppy ingénue in Sunday in New York (1963) and Barefoot in the Park (1967), but by the end of the 1960s, she had committed herself to radicalism, on- and off-screen. For his part, in films like The Trip and Easy Rider, Peter cast his lot with the drop-outs and druggies so effectively portrayed in Quentin Tarantino’s recent Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood.
Perhaps the contrast between father and son can be seen in generational terms: As a member of the Navy, Henry served with honor in World War II; as an adherent of the counterculture, Peter got no closer to the American flag than the design of his famous motorcycle helmet in Easy Rider. To his credit, in an interview in 1975, Henry graciously denied the existence of familial rifts: “When a child decides to go into the father’s business, whether he’s a banker or in show business, there has to be a kind of rebellion.”
Alas, rebellion can have a short half-life. Even as the counterculture cooled down, Peter continued to bop from one anti-establishment film to the next, each weaker than the last: Two People (1973), Open Season (1974), Fighting Mad (1976), and so on. In the end, though, both came around to appreciating their legacy: Just as Jane had the good sense to eventually hitch her wagon to her dad, appearing alongside him in his final effort, On Golden Pond (1981), Peter eventually shaved the sideburns and gave a performance as commanding and careful as that in Ulee’s Gold and several other strong films he made in the wake of its success. In The Limey (1999), in fact, Fonda roasted his own generation with a performance as a morally detestable record producer as a rebuke to sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll. It was on par with his daughter Bridget’s portrait of a beach bum in Jackie Brown (1997).
If Peter Fonda was destined to come of age in an era that would cast him in service of the counterculture that was a reaction to his father’s era, we can at least take solace in the knowledge that he is in his company now.

Free Salinger, You Paranoid Miser

Texto completo: Matt Salinger fancies himself the stalwart protector of his father’s legacy, which includes a tantalizing trove of unpublished manuscripts. But now that it’s clear that it may take 15 years or more before even one manuscript from J.D. Salinger’s safe gets published, Matt is looking less like a dutiful son and more like a paranoid miser.
J.D. Salinger’s four volumes were finally published in digital editions this month after Matt Salinger caved to market demand. “Things like e-books and audiobooks are tough, because he clearly didn’t want them,” the younger Salinger told the New York Times. Well, the Ten Commandments were originally published in stone format but adapting to newer technology did help the words get out. But Matt isn’t letting go of all those manuscripts he’s got under lock and key. He has confirmed the rumors that his father “kept writing for 50 years” (well, 45) after ceasing to publish with a New Yorker short story in 1965. There is a lot of material. He reckons it’ll take “five to seven” more until the manuscripts are fit to publish. In another interview, he says that he “hopes” the additional time needed will be less than 10 years.
So it will take 14 years, probably more, possibly a lot more to ... edit J.D. Salinger’s remaining work? His entire book-publishing career lasted only 12 years, from the publication of The Catcher in the Rye in 1951 until he published his last book, Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction, in 1963. “We’re going as fast as we freaking can,” Matt reassured the Guardian.
I wonder what improvements Matt Salinger, who has dabbled in film and theatrical producing and starred in a little-seen 1990 film of Captain America, is making to J.D.’s work. Fixing punctuation? Giving things a brisk rewrite? More likely, Matt is being slowed by the fear and neurosis that gripped his father, who drank his own urine. What if the new material isn’t so well-received? A cascade effect might ensue. Louis Menand or Adam Gopnik might re-evaluate the previous work. They might even bring up Salinger’s peccadilloes, such as his fixations on very young women, which no longer earns the blithe dismissal it once did. The unpublished work “will definitely disappoint people that he wouldn’t care about,” Matt told the Guardian. I think he means the Gopniks and the Menands.
The unpublished trove contains more Glass family stories, and these are what excite the true devotee. Yet the last one we saw — “Hapworth 16, 1924” (1965), which was the author’s last New Yorker piece — broke the Salinger spell. It painted the 7-year-old zen master Seymour Glass with such a super-genius halo that the effect was ludicrous, and many said so. That reception seems to have stung Salinger into a moody silence that lasted 45 years. What if the subsequent works are equally shoddy?
You can see why Matt might consider reticence the better part of literary trusteeship, which he shares with Salinger’s third wife and widow, Colleen. As it is, Matt can bask in the glow of his father’s legend and live on comfy royalties. Why mess with a good thing? Why invite muddy-footed intruders into the parlor?
Yet a larger issue than Matt Salinger’s ease is at stake. Artists die over time. They get forgotten when one generation’s taste is not shared by the next. Salinger’s fans, heavily concentrated among Baby Boomers and Gen X, are old. Bringing out his unpublished material would be a way to renew interest, to keep the flame burning. It presents opportunity as well as risk.
Salinger was perhaps the single most beloved literary fiction writer of his era, but he is more vulnerable than most to erasure. Catcher is irretrievably dated. Its brand of adolescent angst and rebellion, which touched souls in two generations, falls flat today. It is an obvious candidate to be booted off high-school reading syllabi in favor of something more contemporary that is less hokey and more woke-y. Catcher’s destiny is the cultural landfill.
No reputation is imperishable. By keeping the drawbridge gates up, Matt Salinger thinks he is staving off attack by reappraisal. Instead he is inviting decay by neglect. By the time he releases his father’s work, the world may no longer care.

Texto completo: The chair umpire who was involved in a clash with Serena Williams during last year's U. S. Open final will not work any of her matches in this year's tournament, which is set to begin on Monday.
Carlos Ramos has not worked any of Williams' matches since he docked her a game in the final against Japan's Naomi Osaka for calling him a "liar" and a "thief. "
United States Tennis Association officials confirmed to multiple news outlets this week that Ramos won't officiate any matches at the Open involving the eighth-seeded Williams or her sister Venus.
Ramos called three code-of-conduct violations against Williams in the match she eventually lost to Osaka after ruling she illegally communicated with her coach during the match.
TEEN SENSATION: Coco Gauff embraces Michelle Obama's advice
USTA chief executive Stacey Allaster told the New York Times that officials didn't want to cause a distraction by putting Williams and Ramos on the same court.
“We want to be focused on the competition and want to go forward,” Allaster said. “This is just for 2019. Let’s just not put everyone in that spotlight. It’s not necessary. ”
Williams was fined $17,000 by the US Open for her actions, which also included smashing her racket. Ramos was not disciplined and received the full backing of the International Tennis Federation after the incident.
Williams will face former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova in her first-round match on Monday.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Appearing on "Fox and Friends" on Monday morning, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said that The New York Times' 1619 Project was "a lie. "
The 1619 Project is an effort by the Times to commemorate the 400th anniversary of slavery's beginning in America. The 1619 Project aims to "reframe the country's history, [understand] 1619 as our true founding, and [place] the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are. "
Gingrich disagreed with the 1619 Project's interpretation of history, which included essays by New York Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, Princeton University sociologist Matthew Desmond and Harvard University professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad.
"The whole project is a lie," Gingrich said. "Look, I think slavery is a terrible thing. I think putting slavery in context is important. We still have slavery in places around the world today, so we recognize this is an ongoing story.
More: Pete Buttigieg says Trump voters are 'looking the other way on racism'
More: 2020 Democrats are stepping up their courtship of Native American voters. Here’s why.
"Certainly if you're an African American, slavery is at the center of what you see as the American experience. But for most Americans, most of the time, there were a lot of other things going on," Gingrich said. "There were several hundred thousand white Americans who died in the Civil War in order to free the slaves. "
Gingrich went on to compare The New York Times to Pravda, the Soviet propaganda newspaper, for what he saw as anti-Trump bias.
Hannah-Jones, who led the project, responded to similar criticism on Twitter from Gingrich on Sunday.
"A very proud moment," she declared.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump reversed himself on firearms restrictions Wednesday, saying he supports background checks one day after saying he didn't want to go down the "slippery slope" of eroding gun owners' rights.
Trump confirmed that he discussed background checks with Wayne LaPierre, head of the National Rifle Association, but he disputed news reports that he told LaPierre that background checks were off the table.
"I have an appetite for background checks," Trump said from the White House South Lawn as he departed for an event in Louisville, Kentucky. "We're going to be doing background checks. We're going to be filling in some of the loopholes."
Trump said he wants to get guns out of the hands of the mentally unstable and said he considers mass shootings a public emergency.
"I want guns to be in the hands of people who are mentally stable," he said.
Tuesday, Trump had backed away from supporting stricter gun measures, saying laws were already "very strong."
"We have very strong background checks right now," he said.
The president emphasized his staunch support for the Second Amendment.
In the aftermath of the deadly mass shootings in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, Texas, Trump indicated he would back stricter background check measures in an effort to stem gun violence.
Almost two weeks ago, Trump said that "we need intelligent background checks" and that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was "totally on board."
Tuesday, Trump spoke on the phone with the NRA's LaPierre.
The Atlantic first reported the details of the phone call, followed by The Washington Post and The New York Times.
According to the outlets, Trump told LaPierre that comprehensive background checks for firearm purchases were no longer under consideration and that the White House would advocate for other measures concerning mental health or the prosecution of federal gun crimes.
The NRA confirmed that a call took place, posting a message Tuesday on Twitter from LaPierre that he spoke to the president.
"We discussed the best ways to prevent these types of tragedies. @realDonaldTrump is a strong #2A President and supports our Right to Keep and Bear Arms," LaPierre wrote through the official NRA account.
The NRA has vehemently opposed the imposition of stricter background checks for firearm purchases, but strife at the organization gave gun control advocates hope that measures could be passed.

Salisbury native awarded $725K in neo-Nazi suit

Texto completo: When one Salisbury native became the first black woman to serve as student government president at American University, it wasn't ribbons and posters catching the nation's eyes in 2017.
It was bananas and threatening messages hung from nooses around the Washington D.C. campus on her first day in office.
But she might be getting some closure this week.
Taylor Dumpson won a lawsuit Friday against the neo-Nazi website operator who organized an online harassment campaign against her.
A federal judge granted default judgement to the Wicomico High School graduate, awarding her more than $725,000 after The Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin and a follower failed to respond to her lawsuit, according to the Associated Press.
Along with compensatory damages of $101,429.28, punitive damages of $500,000 and attorneys' fees and costs of $124,022.10 awarded, the judge also entered a restraining order against Anglin, his Moonbase Holdings limited liability company and Brian Andrew Ade.
Anglin had posted an article about the hanging installations, directing followers to "troll storm" Dumpson on social media, and according to her lawsuit, the publisher directed his known neo-Nazi site's readers to cyberbully her.
The lawsuit states that for days after the article was published, Dumpson was attacked with hateful comments on multiple social media platforms.
Dumpson lost an unhealthy amount of weight as a result of the article. She "experienced flashbacks, nightmares, depression, anxiety and disordered eating, and engaged in avoidance behavior, as a result of these events," according to the lawsuit, as previously reported by Delmarva Now.
But she also took the experience as a chance to empower others — looking to inspire people to confront hatred and injustice nonconfrontationally.
Dumpson was interviewed about the incident and her resolve by CNN and national publications including the New York Times and Washington Post, and recorded a stand-up discussion on TEDx Talks in June 2017, as previously reported by Delmarva Now.
"There is power in sharing your story, especially given the national climate right now," she told Delmarva Now back in 2017. "You have to engage in these conversations to move forward."
Dumpson also said her journey to embrace diversity and social justice started in one corner of Salisbury — Wi-Hi.
"Wi-Hi introduced me to social justice before I understood the meaning of the phrase," she said in 2017. "It sparked my interest in things like redistricting in Wicomico County and how we fund our education system."
Dumpson made her way to the private university after graduating, and she continued to promote tolerance and inclusiveness — eventually opening the conversation on a national scale that summer.
She ultimately left the post — receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress according to her suit — but her case was reportedly meant to show people will be held accountable for their unlawful attacks to a person online.
Now, her representation says this ruling should send a loud message to other white supremacists.
"They can and will be held accountable for hateful activity that constitutes unlawful discrimination, no matter whether it occurs online or in the real world," Kristen Clarke told the AP, serving as president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
In this May 4, 2017, photo, American University student government President Taylor Dumpson speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington. Dumpson, the first black woman to serve as American University's student government president, sued a neo-Nazi website's publisher, accusing him of orchestrating an online harassment campaign against her.

Startup creates giant computer chip for AI

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO - The largest computer chips would usually fit in the palm of your hand. Some could rest on the tip of your finger. Conventional wisdom says anything bigger would be a problem.
Now a Silicon Valley startup, Cerebras, is challenging that not on. On Monday, the company unveiled what it claims is the largest computer chip ever built. As big as a dinner plate - about 100 times the size of a typical chip - it would barely fit in your lap.
The engineers behind the chip believe it can be used in giant data centers and help accelerate the progress of artificial intelligence in everything from self-driving cars to talking digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa.
Many companies are building new chips for AI, including traditional chip-makers like Intel and Qual-comm and other startups in the United States, Britain and China.
Some experts believe these chips will play a key role in the race to create artificial intelligence, potentially shifting the balance of power among tech companies and even nations. They could feed the creation of commercial products and government technologies, including surveillance systems and autonomous weapons.
Google has already built such a chip and uses it in a wide range of Al projects, including the Google Assistant, which recognizes voice commands on Android phones, and Google Translate, which translates one language into another.
"There is monstrous growth in this field," said Cerebras' chief executive and founder, Andrew Feldman, a chip industry veteran who previous y sold a company to the chip giant AMD.
AI systems operate with many chips working together. The trouble is that moving big chunks of data between chips can be slow, and can limit how quickly chips analyze that information.
"Connecting all these chips together actually slows them down - and consumes a lot of energy," said Subramanian Iyer, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who specializes in chip design for artificial intelligence.
Hardware makers are exploring many different options. Some are trying to broaden the pipes that run between chips. Cerebras, a three-year-old company backed by more than $200 million in funding, has taken a novel approach. The idea is to keep all the data on a giant chip so a system can operate faster.
Working with one big chip is very hard to do. Computer chips are typically built onto round silicon wafers that are about 12 inches in diameter. Each wafer usually contains about 100 chips.
Many of these chips, when removed from the wafer, are thrown out and never used. Etching circuits into the silicon is such a complex process, manufacturers cannot eliminate defects. Some circuits just don't work. This is part of the reason that chipmakers keep their chips small - less room for error, so they do not have to throw as many of them away.
Cerebras said it had built a chip the size of an entire wafer.
Others have tried this, most notably a startup called Trilogy, founded in 1980 by the well-known IBM chip engineer Gene Amdahl. Though it was backed by over $230 million in funding, Trilogy ultimately decided the task was too difficult and it folded after five years.
Nearly 35 years later, Cerebras plans to start shipping hardware to a small number of customers next month. Feldman said the chip could train AI systems between 100 and 1,000 times faster than existing hardware.
He and his engineers have divided their giant chip into smaller sections, or cores, with the understanding that some cores will not work. The chip is designed to route information around these defective areas.
Significant questions hang over the company's hardware. Feldman's performance claims have not been independently verified and he did not reveal how much the chip will cost.
The price will depend on how efficiently Cerebras and its manufacturing partner, the Taiwanese-based TSMC, can build the chip.
The process is a "lot more labor intensive," said Brad Paulsen, a senior vice president with TSMC. A chip this large also consumes large amounts of power, which means that keeping it cool will be difficult - and expensive. In other words, building the chip is only part of the task.
"This is a challenge for us," Paulsen said. "And it is a challenge for them."
Cerebras plans to sell the chip as part of a much larger machine that includes elaborate equipment for cooling the silicon with chilled liquid. It is nothing like what the big tech companies and government agencies are used to working with.
"It is not that people have not been able to build this kind of a chip," said Rakesh Kumar, a professor at the University of Illinois who is also exploring large chips for AI. "The problem is that they have not been able to build one that is commercially feasible."

Texto completo: Parenting is rewarding, but it is also challenging. It is a full-time, rest-of-your life job.
You always think — hope — that whatever difficulty you are facing with one period of a child’s life and development will simply be solved when he or she grows out of that phase. Soon, they’ll be potty trained, or be able to retrieve their own snacks, or walk home from school alone, or whatever.
But, what one soon discovers is that one phase of difficulties is only replaced by the difficulties of the next. Parenting doesn’t necessarily get easier, it is simply transformed. There are new joys, but also new headaches.
And, I find that the headache part is the part parents feel tremendous shame disclosing. Our modern, parenting-book, social-media-sharing culture seems to dictate that the only thing that one can say about parenting is that “it is the most important and fulfilling thing I’ve ever done.” That is the only way that one is allowed to signify that one loves his or her children and has made the sufficient level of sacrifice.
I find those constraints ridiculous and impossible. It is possible to love your children complete and simultaneously be exhausted by them. For many parents, that is the truth, and there is nothing shameful about acknowledging that.
Since my oldest son was 6 and my twins were 3, I have been a single dad. Even though I have always had demanding jobs, I threw myself fully into my role as a father, making breakfast every morning and dinner every evening. (Sometimes a babysitter would do that, and I was thankful for the help.)
You do what is required of you as a parent. You rise to the challenge. You make it to every school activity, sporting event and music recital. You arrange the play dates, sleepovers and birthday parties. You make the 1 a.m. run through the snowstorm to get the fever-reducing medicine and you change the bedding and mop the floor when a stomach virus turns their room into a scene from “The Exorcist.”
You enjoy the good times, vacations and the family game nights or pizza-and-a-movie nights, but, at least for me, the years wear on and the fatigue of it all slowly begins to set in. It is easy to forget that you owe it to yourself to have a separate personal life, that you were a fully formed independent adult before them and you will have to be again when they are gone.
It wasn’t until the younger two were seniors in high school that it dawned on me that I had not been on an actual vacation in more than 10 years. Sure, I traveled — for work, with my daughter to her fencing tournaments, to professional conferences, to take the children to visit their grandparents — but, none of that was particularly relaxing or designed to be.
I believe that in my head, at least for the past four years my children were in high school and in my house, I had a countdown clock in my head: I just had to hold out and maintain them as my priority in life for a little while longer and then they would go away to college and my life would finally begin.
That day finally came four years ago when my twins went away to college. I was now officially an empty nester. I was 45 years old and I had only ever lived alone for four months in my life, and for those four months I was engaged to be married.
People often ask me if I was sad that the children had gone away, expecting me to say how lost and lonely I was. I didn’t. I told them how free I felt, how I felt that I was entering a new life of my own, and I felt absolutely no guilt about that.
I traveled. I reconnected with old friends and made new ones. And, I was able to work as long and as hard as I liked and never had to worry that there were children at home who needed me there.
But, now that the children have graduated and moved back into my house as they search for jobs and eventually first apartments, I will say the thing that we as parents are not supposed to say: What happened to my empty nest? The very definition of home has changed. Mine will always be their family home, their spiritual home, but it cannot be their primary home. This is now my primary home, alone.
I know that this arrangement is temporary, and I want to help my children out in every way possible, but it would be dishonest to say that their reappearance in “their rooms,” which I now call guest rooms, has been jarring.
No matter how much I try to resist the urge, I’m reverting to my last-phase parenting mode — worrying about whether they’re eating enough and eating healthfully, washing their clothes and taking them to their rooms.
These are young adults and not children. I have to remember that. I also have to remember that this phase is temporary. But, I also have to prevent them from dragging their feet leaving home and starting their own lives.
When your children return to your empty nest, it is a good thing to firmly nudge them out. That, too, is what love looks like.

With A Little Human Help, Wild Pups Romp Again In An African Paradise

Texto completo: Last summer, not long after releasing a pioneer pack of 14 African wild dogs into Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park as part of an ambitious wildlife restoration effort, Paola Bouley went to see for herself what in the name of Canis major could have happened to the wild dog pups.
As Gorongosa’s carnivore expert, Bouley knew that Beira, the alpha female of the pack, had been pregnant when the dogs were set free. She knew that the closely bonded and highly endangered apex predators had dug a maternity den for their queen, and that Beira had spent a lot of time down there - until one day, she didn’t. She and the pack had moved on.
But where were the pups?
As Bouley was crouching by the abandoned den and peering into the hole, she met the likely answer. A giant African rock python - the continent’s largest species of snake, which can grow to 20 feet and swallow an impala whole - dropped from a nearby tree, stared her in the face and then slithered off.
“I think it was disappointed that I wasn’t a warthog,” Bouley said.
Yet the wild dogs were unbowed, and this year, after migrating to a less serpent-y sector of Gorongosa’s 1 million acres, they made up for lost time in spectacular fashion. Beira give birth in late April to 11 pups, who emerged from their den in early June and appear on camera trap footage to be thriving, as well as inexcusably cute (although the runt of the litter eventually died).
Of greater surprise to Bouley and her colleagues, Nhamagaia, the beta female of the pack, defied the L. pictus convention that only the resident alpha female gets to breed, and in late June delivered her own litter of eight.
The researchers initially feared that Beira and the other adult dogs might reject the off-label young, leaving them to die of neglect. But no: The new pups have been swept up into the sens-a-round frenzy of carnivore kumbaya - life as an ardently, obligately social mammal for whom, as wild dog expert Scott Creel of Montana State University put it, “the worst thing that can happen is to be alone.”
Gorongosa’s pup eruption didn’t end there. Not far from the Beira-Nhamagaia creche, a group of four adult dogs that had split off from the original pack in the spring - three males and one female - appeared to be successfully rearing yet another litter of eight pups.
“It’s incredibly exciting,” said Cole du Plessis, coordinator of the wild dog range expansion program at the Endangered Wildlife Trust. “At the beginning of last year there were no wild dogs in Gorongosa, and now we’re closing in on 50.”
And why not? “When I flew over Gorongosa,” du Plessis said, “looking at the prey numbers, the water, the topography - I thought, if you could sketch what wild dog heaven would look like, Gorongosa is it.”
The successful reintroduction into Gorongosa of African wild dogs underscores the park’s position as one of the bright spots on an otherwise grim landscape of shrinking forests and accelerating loss of large, charismatic animals unlucky enough to not be our pets or livestock.
During Mozambique’s civil war, which ended in the mid-1990s, Gorongosa’s abundant wildlife was almost destroyed. Since then, the park has been steadily recovering, aided by an unusual partnership between the Mozambique government and the wealthy American philanthropist Gregory Carr, along with input from local communities, international teams of scientists, conservationists, human rights advocates - really, anybody Carr can get on the phone.
Researchers see in Gorongosa the chance to track the recovery of a complex ecosystem from the ground up, and to see what will heal on its own and what requires intervention.
Getting the right mix of grazers and meat-eaters has proved a particular challenge.
Herbivores were the first to bounce back in post-conflict Gorongosa, and today the park pulses with more than 100,000 of them: blue wildebeest, buffalo, impala, hippo, waterbuck, reedbuck, elephant, eland, nyala, oribi, the hauntingly beautiful sable, the disturbingly furry bushpig.
Experts thought that, with so much meat on the hoof, carnivores of all stripes would surely immigrate from surrounding areas of their own accord, but predator rebound has proved spotty - or not spotty enough.
The lions in the park have fared well, and from the handful that remained after the war, the number today is 146 and rising. “We’ve got cubs everywhere,” Bouley said. “It’s hard keeping up with them.”
Not so for the other major predators. Spotted hyenas, which are common in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa and once were a Gorongosa staple, have yet to return, and the park team hopes to reintroduce a clan or two in the next few years. So, too, the leopards: Camera traps have picked up a lone leopard, probably a male, skulking around at night, but for all the park’s abundance of a leopard’s favorite dish, baboon, that loner has remained a party of one.
“We’re pushing to translocate some females from outlying areas into the core of the park,” Bouley said. “That should draw in other males and jump-start the leopard population.”
In the meantime, the wild dogs are having their day, hunting ferociously and cooperatively every morning and afternoon and sometimes in between.
Wild dogs, which are also known as painted wolves, are not like other dogs. According to a recent genomic analysis, they split off from the rest of the canid lineage some 1.7 million years ago. They twitter and sneeze rather than bark or howl, and their ears are like satellite dishes to track prey and one another’s high-pitched calls. Their legs are like the sticks of a shadow puppet, and they have four toes rather than five, an adaptation that helps them run at up to 45 mph.
In Gorongosa, the dogs target bushbuck, impala and waterbuck, surrounding the prey, grabbing at legs, nose and hindquarters, disemboweling it from below. Whatever they do, they do as a team. A lion may stray from its pride for hours or even days at a time, but wild dogs are never out of sight, smell and sound of their pack mates.
Creel, who has studied dog packs in Zambia and Tanzania, said, “If you don’t see an individual for an hour, you know the dog has either died or dispersed” - gone off to join a new pack.
Group life has its privileges, including being cared for when sick or injured. Last year Nhamagaia, the beta female, broke a front leg. “You could see it dangling,” Bouley said. “We thought we were going to lose her.”
But though the dog straggled behind, the pack would wait patiently for her and make sure she could feed at a kill, and the leg eventually healed.
The dogs are cooperative hunters and cooperative breeders, a fairly rare reproductive strategy among mammals. In this system, the alpha pair of the pack do most of the breeding, while the other adults serve as childless helpers at the nest. They regurgitate meat from a kill to feed the lactating alpha female, and they regurgitate still more to fuel her weaned but dependent, ever-begging pups.
The alpha dogs defend their status through minor acts of aggression, nips and charges, particularly during mating season, but the subordinates don’t seem to mind. Creel and his colleagues found that underdogs have lower levels of stress hormones, compared to the dominant pair.
Subordinate females generally don’t bother to ovulate, and their balance of sex hormones resembles that of women on birth control pills. It’s a tough enough job to keep the alpha female’s litter alive, especially in brutally competitive settings where the dogs are surrounded by lions and hyenas eager to steal their prey and kill their young, and where the ranges of other dog packs encroach on theirs.
Moreover, because subordinate pack members often are related to the dominant dogs, helping the pups keeps some fraction of their genetic legacy alive.
Nevertheless, subordinates may seek higher status and personal parenthood in a number of ways: by dispersing to a neighboring pack if available, forming a new pack, or getting pregnant at home and hoping for the best.
Bouley suspects that Gorongosa’s lavish conditions, of abundant prey and light competition, explain the success of Nhamagaia’s insubordinate act. The alpha female not only didn’t shun the beta’s young - with her own pups mostly weaned, Beira pitched in as wet nurse to the new brood. The older pups treat their juniors like toys, one taking the head, the other the tail, in a tug of war.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The parents, grandparents, husbands and wives came forward one by one to testify. In a federal courtroom in western Virginia, they told a judge about children lost to deadly overdoses and how crippling addiction had destroyed their families. The judge presiding over that July 20, 2007, sentencing hearing for Purdue Pharma -- the company that manufactured and marketed OxyContin -- and three of its executives told our reporter Barry Meier that in two decades on the bench, he had never heard so many victims testify.
Unfortunately, no audio or video recording was allowed that day. So the puzzle was how to bring the emotion of that testimony to life for television in a way that would stay true to the journalistic principles of The Times. While "The Weekly" does not prohibit the use of re-enactments -- a policy that other news organizations sometimes adopt -- its producers are charged with keeping accuracy in mind at all times.
We decided early on that we would not try to re-enact the hearing; we would not hire actors to read the transcripts. The fear was that actors would naturally add their own emphasis that might not accurately depict what took place in 2007. But simply putting the words onscreen wouldn't convey the emotion of that day. So instead, we invited many of the 19 witnesses who had testified to visit recording studios near their homes and read the transcript of their words themselves.
In many cases, contacting them was easy, since a lot of families have stayed in touch with each other over the years. Ed Bisch is a man whose son died from taking OxyContin at a party back in 2001. As an IT worker, he had the know-how to start a website early on, OxyKills.com, to organize families around the country with similar experiences. To this day, he maintains an email chain with many of the parents and loved ones who testified in 2007.
For those whom we could not reach, we relied on the research desk at The New York Times. Their expertise is in using public records, social media and other sources to track down individuals who are hard to find. Once they received our request, we had phone numbers and email addresses within a few short hours.
Fortunately, all the witnesses we contacted were willing to participate -- though for many of them it meant revisiting an emotionally wrenching day.
The process of recording their words unfolded over about a week. At each session, I would call or Skype in to a recording studio somewhere in America. On the other end of the line would be a sound engineer and one of the original witnesses. Our team had provided them with a copy of their original testimony as transcribed by the court stenographer, but asked that they not read it until they were in the recording booth -- for fear they might rehearse it and affect the authenticity of the read. I also asked that the recording engineer test the audio levels beforehand by having the witnesses talk about what they'd had for breakfast. Given the emotional drain of their testimony, I didn't want them to have to do more takes than necessary.
Once inside the recording booth, it was striking to hear the voices of parents and loved ones break with emotion -- as fresh today as it had been 12 years ago. Lynn Swanson fought through tears as she recalled her son's dreams of becoming a firefighter or paramedic. Marianne Skolek Perez recited her testimony almost from memory, her anger at Purdue's executives still palpable. Leona Nuss brought with her to the studio the same urn filled with her son's ashes that she had thrust toward the defendants in court when she said, "This is from your drug, OxyContin."
Many of the people who testified said they were closely following the ongoing litigation against the opioid industry. Back in 2007, they told me, they were cautiously optimistic, hoping that the company they saw as responsible for their pain and loss would see justice. But as that day faded into history, and the opioid crisis only worsened, their outlook soon changed. Many of them said they were now unhappy with the government's decision to settle the case and not pursue felony charges against the executives, and they worry that if states and cities suing drugmakers reach settlement deals this time around, the full story of one of the nation's worst public health crises may never come out.

Texto completo: As a freshman in college, after the Las Vegas shooting in 2017, I wrote a poem titled "Please Mr. President" that was published in The New York Times and then the Daily Herald.
I clung to an idealism meant for storybooks, addressing an envelope with my poem to the White House, half-believing that our president would read and share my words.
He didn’t. I’m still not sure why I was surprised.
I’d directed my hope and plea for change at our president. Two years later, I’ve come to realize that my hopes and pleas mean nothing to the people in power.
When I was 14 years old, standing in my kitchen, my parents told me about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. We reached the absolute worst — a massacre of children — in 2012, and then because the leaders of our country placed priority on other matters, we watched Las Vegas happen.
We watched Parkland happen. And then Sante Fe. And then Pittsburgh. And then Virginia Beach.
Most recently, we learned that 22 people were gunned down in El Paso, Texas, and another nine in Dayton, Ohio.
I have friends in Dayton and in Texas. I was scared for them.
I was scared for all of us.
Each time a tragic event occurs, we follow a script that begins with well-meaning words from people in power and ends without action. During a vigil in Dayton, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s words were overshadowed by people shouting, "Do something."
This discussion has been under way for a long time, but it’s difficult to move forward when progress is stalled by one excuse or another. It’s difficult to prioritize empathy, integrity and a sense of moral responsibility in a dialogue where money seems to supersede everything else.
Lately, politicians and civilians alike have resorted to blaming particular groups of people, hoping to pinpoint the problem and shift blame. We don’t have time for that. We have allowed the analysis, blaming and media coverage of mass shootings to become a partisan issue.
Yet it always has been, and will remain, a moral issue in which politics has no place. Set aside the right and left for a moment and realize that our own people are dying because of these divisions.
America, we must bind together and demand that this violence ends. We are blessed to look at that flag of red, white and blue fluttering in the breeze and remember the strength and power it represents.
America, we have so much potential for good, but we each have to want it.
A little over a week ago at Wrigley Field, I rose for the national anthem, feeling hopeful and hopeless at the same time. I watched our American flag fly at half-staff in light of the Ohio and Texas shootings.
In a moment void of partisan politics, I listened to acoustic guitar notes and patriotic lyrics waft over the baseball diamond. I watched 40,000 baseball fans rise together, bound by a pride and love for our nation.
It was one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.
It was during those few moments that I realized we each owe it to ourselves and our country to start demanding changes immediately.
The time for politicians’ well-meaning words is over. People are tired of well-meaning words because well-meaning words represent a fear to do something more.
America, I don’t want to appeal to the emotions of Congress or the president. I want to appeal to you. To your emotions and your hearts.
To the parents who send their kids on buses to school, trusting each day that their children’s education will not be compromised because of gun violence. To the families taking their kids to the movies, to concerts, to shopping malls, praying that their city won’t be in the headlines the next day because of gun violence.
I don’t think it wise for any of us to wait for Congress to change its predictable pattern. It has been given ample chances to step forward and make concrete changes to prevent gun violence. It won’t bring changes to the table on its own.
And if it won’t, then America, we must.
The movement for change starts from the ground up, and it starts with the people. And not just the people or towns affected by gun violence but every person in every city. So let’s start with the small steps.
We can fill the inboxes of congressmen and women with requests for new laws. We can write letters to senators asking for sessions on gun regulation. We can speak peacefully and directly to our governors about taking action to solve this problem instead of talking about it, just as a group of people did during Gov. DeWine’s speech.
Countless gun reform groups are already advocating for change. Everytown for Gun Safety, started in 2006, has nearly 6 million supporters. America, we can join them.
For the safety and protection of our citizens, we each must step forward and speak until the people in power cannot ignore us.

Texto completo: A waiter was shot to death in a restaurant just outside Paris by an impatient customer who lost his temper for having to wait for a sandwich, bystanders said.
The customer, who has not been identified, shot the waiter in the shoulder with a handgun after believing that the restaurant was taking too long to prepare his sandwich, according to several media reports.
The restaurant, Mistral, is in the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Grand. The suburb is less than 10 miles east of Paris' city center.
The waiter, 28, died on the scene.
The eatery, which mainly serves burgers and sandwiches, opened in March, according to its website.
The gunman has not been found as of Sunday, The New York Times reported.
Some area residents attribute the attack to people who loiter around the neighborhood and drink and use drugs, according to local publication Le Parisien.
But others, including city officials, rejected that notion.
"Crime rates are declining in our city," Sylvain Thézard, chief of staff to Noisy-Le-Grand’s mayor, Brigitte Marsigny, told The Times. "This murder is by no means the result of a deeper problem. It’s nothing but sad news. ”

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Earlier this summer, journalists on the Climate desk at The New York Times heard a curious rumor: Phoenix was turning into a city of vampires.
It began when Hannah Fairfield, the Climate editor, got wind that outdoor workers in Phoenix had begun working at dawn and dusk in summer months to avoid the sweltering heat. That gave rise to a photo-driven project about the city, which documents the ways climate change has caused Phoenix's days to creep earlier into the morning and later at night, away from high sunshine. "It's so hot during the day that everyone has to come out and conduct their lives and their business at night," said Matt McCann, a photo editor at The Times who works with the Climate desk.
The photographer George Etheredge spent nearly a week covering this way of life with Marguerite Holloway, the reporter. Before leaving New York, Ms. Holloway spent weeks calling businesses and investigating summer lifestyle shifts that would offer Mr. Etheredge something compelling to photograph when they arrived in Phoenix in early July.
The Phoenix Zoo, for instance, opens two hours earlier in the summer to bypass the worst of the day's heat. Ms. Holloway and Mr. Etheredge woke up around 3 a.m. to get there as it prepped for opening. Another pre-dawn jaunt saw them guzzling coffee at 2 a.m. to watch a concrete pour at a hospital, before touring the construction site for a new high-rise building until the sun rose.
It was stunning to Ms. Holloway that after living -- even briefly -- in heat that reached well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, "I could very quickly feel that 90 really felt lovely and the 80s felt positively brisk," she said. Still, she added, "I learned that I am not heat-adapted." When she and Mr. Etheredge ventured out to the Piestewa Peak trailhead to talk to people who like to hike in peak heat, "I felt it," she said. It reached 114 degrees.
Mr. Etheredge recalled photographing Lee H. Thomason, who walks around the trailhead with water and electrolyte packets to help hikers, when suddenly Mr. Etheredge's flash stopped working. "It was just too hot," he said, though luckily, "that was the only mishap." And in the early mornings and evenings, "the light ended up actually being really nice."
When he gave Mr. Etheredge the assignment, Mr. McCann told him to go "buck wild." And as far as Mr. McCann is concerned, he did. "I was like, this story could go in 18 different directions."
Mr. McCann said he was struck by the playfulness and sense of humor in the photos Mr. Etheredge took. "He has this way of finding really odd moments," like a giraffe hiding his head behind a tree at the zoo, or a pair of feet at the end of a playground slide, Mr. McCann said. "People know what it's like to be in a slide, and you can almost hear the skin against the hot plastic going down," he added. "That's what that photo does."
Mr. Etheredge spotted an odd congruity when he was finished shooting: the way dust and water both look the same when the sun is behind them. "Water and dust kept popping up in these pictures, and the way they mimic each other was really interesting to me," Mr. Etheredge said. "Dried soil is something that Phoenix has, it's the essence of the desert, and then water is something that Phoenix doesn't have for hundreds of miles."
In the project's online presentation, the photos progress from night to day, which became an organizing principle for Mr. McCann. And for Ms. Fairfield and Claire O'Neill, a visual editor and art director who designed it digitally, it was a welcome source of inspiration.
"I had originally put twinkling stars in the background, but was told that that was over the top," Ms. O'Neill said with a laugh. Instead, she sampled colors from the photos and created a gradient background, a subtle visual motif that, to her, demonstrates the story's theme of temporality. As you read, the colors get warmer and warmer -- and then when it's daytime, Mr. McCann mused, "it's sort of like game over."

FCC urges three digits for suicide call number

Texto completo: Headnote Effort comes amid rising numbers across nation
Just as 911 is universal to Americans during emergencies, a federal agency says the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline should be shortened to three digits: 988.
The Federal Communications Commission recommended simplifying the hotline's current 10-digit number in a sweeping report this week spurred by federal legislation passed last year that called for improvements to the system.
The effort comes at a time when counseling experts say there is a deepening national mental health crisis and there has been a spate of suicides among veterans, police officers and high-profile figures.
The deaths of celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, fashion designer Kate Spade and electronic recording artist Avicii have raised public awareness about the scope of the epidemic and how it cuts across socioeconomic, gender and cultural lines.
In 2018, more than 2.2 million people called the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255, according to the FCC.
"Our team found that a three-digit number would make it easier for Americans in crisis to reach someone who could help," Ajit Pai, the FCC's chairman, said in an email statement Thursday night. "If we can stand up '988' nationwide as a way to access suicide prevention services, we believe it could save lives. I'll do everything I can to move this forward."
The hotline was started in 2005 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Vibrant Emotional Health, a nonprofit administrator. The network is made up of more than 163 local crisis centers, which are staffed by trained counselors. Calls to the hotline are routed to the nearest crisis center or a backup call center at times of high call volume.
The change would not require congressional or presidential approval. As part of the its rule-making process, the commission is expected to issue a public notice that it is considering formally adopting the 998 number for the suicide hotline, which requires a time period for public comment. The commission would then take a formal vote on the measure.
The substance abuse and mental health agency, which is part of the Health and Human Services Department, endorsed the plan.
"SAMHSA supports this proposal to make it easier to connect people in crisis to 24/7 support - with the understanding we would need to have the sustained resources to make this update a reality," a spokesman for the agency said Thursday.
Federal telecommunications regulators say that they examined using existing three-digit numbers, known as Nil codes, such as 211, 511 and 611, for the suicide prevention hotline, but ruled that they were not appropriate. In New York City, for example, 311 is a nonemergency hotline for city services.
Commenting in the FCC report, health officials said when a person "experiences severe chest pains in the company of another family member, both the patient and the family member, despite their heightened anxiety, would remember the number 911, while the concern is that many suicidal people or their family members at a similar moment of suicidal crisis might not remember 1-800-273-8255 (TALK)."
Last year, the lifeline's counselors also responded to 102,640 online crisis chats, according to the FCC.
In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died by suicide and more than 1.4 million adults attempted suicide, according to health officials.
If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/ resources for a list of additional resources.

Is Walmart a top assault-style gun seller?

Texto completo: The statement

The ruling

Its true that Walmart is the largest private employer in the United States, but the retailer does not sell assault-style weapons. In fact, the company banned the sale of assault-style rifles in its stores in 2015.

Ruhles use of the term assault-style weapons could lead to some confusion, since theres no universal definition for it.

Generally, people on both sides of the gun debate agree that fully automatic weapons, which are heavily regulated, should be considered assault weapons. (Fully automatic weapons are subject to strict regulations that make them difficult for civilian buyers to purchase.) But theres disagreement over semi-automatic rifles, which have been used in several mass shootings.

When a now-expired ban taking on semi-automatic assault weapons passed in 1994, the Justice Department said, In general, assault weapons are semi-automatic firearms with a large magazine of ammunition that were designed and configured for rapid fire and combat use, according to CNN.

Several big-box retailers currently sell semi-automatic rifles. Walmart just isnt one of them.

Walmart still sells some firearms and ammunition, as part of its long and complex history with guns. But it has ended the sale of weapons that could be considered assault-style.

Walmart has said its current gun sales policy will not change following the two recent mass shootings, meaning the company will continue selling certain firearms despite calls to drop gun sales entirely.

But Walmart has taken some steps over the last several years to refine that policy. Those steps included ending the sale of assault rifles in 2015, a decision the company attributed to low consumer demand, not calls for gun control, according to the New York Times.

We stopped selling assault-style weapons in 2015, Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove told PolitiFact. We have a longstanding commitment to selling firearms safely and compliantly.

It is accurate that Walmart is one of the largest sellers of firearms and ammunition in the United States, Hargrove said. He noted the company sells guns in roughly half of its 4,700 U.S. stores and not, for example, in its neighborhood market stores, where the focus is on groceries.

In 2018, Walmart removed some airsoft guns, toys and other items from its website that resemble assault-style rifles, Hargrove said. It also raised the age limit on gun purchases to 21.

The company has also said it only sells handguns in its Alaska stores, and in July, it stopped selling all guns in New Mexico after the state broadened its law on background checks.

Dicks Sporting Goods decided to stop selling assault-style rifles in 2018, as well.

According to CNN, Bass Pro Shops still sells semi-automatic rifles, and its subsidiary Cabelas offers what its website refers to as semi-automatic tactical rifles. Gander Outdoors also lists semi-auto action firearms on its website. Other online retailers sell semi-automatic rifles, too.

MSNBC did not respond to a request for comment.

Ruhle said Walmart is one of the largest sellers of assault-style weapons.

Walmart does not sell automatic weapons, and it stopped selling semi-automatic rifles in 2015. So we rate this statement False.

Texto completo: Investors often ask who else I read. Actually, few pundits write much that is new, unique and thoughtful. I often sample writers and never read them again.
But some I always read, even those with whom I disagree – exactly because they offer unique angles.
Here is a top-tier smattering of 15 heavyweights always worth considering:
Kimberley Strassel and Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal rip apart the underbelly of political intrigue and mystery of events like the Mueller investigation better than anyone else. . Somehow, they get inside complexity without getting lost.
Recession? Really? This 10-year economic expansion won't just die of old age
John Tamny from RealClearMarkets. com writes caustically but shows why most economic pontificators are looney. His economics is fundamental and never blindsided by fads. Sometimes he misses that other things, like politics, may be more important than economics.
For a guy with a small investment business, Barry Ritholtz of Bloomberg has a huge voice. He is unusually brief and cuts through market nonsense and bad investment management practices. He has a nose for BS. And America’s market jabber overflows in BS.
I read Jim Cramer at The Street just because I love the guy and have for a long time. He’s fun. Sometimes his offbeat market notions are way off, but other times they are spot on, finding gems in haystacks that most other miss. He has way more common sense than his animated TV antics imply.
Steve Forbes, a multi-decade friend, is a fundamental writer on monetary policy. While he often advocates a gold standard – which will happen when hell freezes over – his prognostications are routinely right, robust and insightful.
Gillian Tett of The Financial Times dives super deep into banking blunders. If we ever again have 2008-like banking problems, you likely hear it from Gillian long before others. Often too pessimistic because, like most journalists, she seeks problems, her knack for climbing inside banking is second to none.
Caroline Baum of Marketwatch is surgically precise on things interest-rate related and the Federal Reserve. She routinely depicts what is wrong with current consensus thinking and speaks directly to real causes, effects, and the correctness or not of Fed actions. She also opines on politics, but there, doesn't say anything unusual.
You can bookend Baum with Jeffrey Gundlach who runs asset management firm, Doubleline. He writes irregularly – but is also cameoed in various print and TV media. Currently the world’s much-acclaimed “Bond King”, with an ego to match, he is always worth considering because of his outsize opinions, often wrong and often right. Even when you’re sure Gundlach is wrong, never underestimate his views.
Home for sale: Mortgage rates drop, helping homeowners and buyers
Dow: Why the dog days of August makes 401(k) investors sweat
For money-saving tips, Bill Baldwin of Forbes, is tops. (He was my editor there for 10 years. ) He is always sniffing out unheralded ways for you to invest better. No nonsense, super experienced, plain-spoken and modest to a fault, Bill’s advice can save your retirement nest egg big bucks.
Joseph Bosco of The Hill dissects Asian political affairs uniquely. Merryn Somerset Webb of MoneyWeek and the Financial Times attacks virtually everything I believe in – which is why I read her. Three heavies – Jamie Dimon of J. P. Morgan, Larry Fink of Blackrock and Ray Dalio of Bridgewater – are all meritorious on almost any darned thing.
Ken Fisher is founder and executive chairman of Fisher Investments, author of 11 books, four of which were New York Times bestsellers, and is No. 200 on the Forbes 400 list of richest Americans. Follow him on Twitter: @KennethLFisher

Texto completo: Many of you are aware, at least vaguely, that the American newspaper is disappearing. Dailies and weeklies have not “fallen on tough times” or “hit a rough patch” – they are dying, everywhere.

There is no safe publication; there is no universal solution waiting to be implemented. And there are no bad guys. Newspapers are not failing because of greedy owners, biased journalists or bad headlines. They are closing because there is a belief among many consumers of news that information, even information that takes money and time to unearth, understand and report, should be free. Why pay for something that pops up gratis on your social media feed?
What some people may not know is that the information they read for free on Facebook, Twitter and other sites – or see on the local TV news – often comes from a newspaper staffed by paid reporters and editors. The perception that the void left by dead newspapers will be filled by people posting on social media ignores that reality. It is like being untroubled by a drought because your well still has water. Without rain, even the deepest well will eventually run dry.
In a special section on Sunday, Aug. 4, titled “A Future Without a Front Page,” the New York Times outlined just how dire the situation has become for the nation's newspapers. Here are some of the statistics cited in the report:
“Over the last 15 years, about 2,100 local newspapers – or roughly a quarter of all local newsrooms – have either merged with a competitor or ceased printing.”
“About 6,800 local newspapers continue to operate across the country, but many are shells of their former selves.”
“More than 200 counties have no newspapers at all, a news vacuum that affects an estimated 3.2 million residents.”
“Print readers are disappearing even faster than print newspapers: Since 2004, total circulation of dailies and weeklies has declined to about 70 million from 122 million.”
The locally owned Concord Monitor has been around for more than 150 years. We don't know what the future holds, but we hope it's 150 more, in whatever form that takes. We do know right now the Monitor has a dedicated readership and a deep impact on our communities. Like many newspapers, we have been forced to adapt to a changing media landscape and the growing challenges of putting out a newspaper and website with a degree of efficiency that would have been unimaginable to a newsroom back in the 1980s.
Whatever your opinion of the local newspaper, we hope you understand the role it plays. A newspaper's main mission is a simple one: to tell the stories of the communities it serves. This can be as basic as announcing births, deaths, marriages and graduations, or as complicated as embarking on a months-long investigation to get at a hidden truth. And even in this ever-changing landscape, the Monitor continues to reach more people in its readership area than any other outlet.
In this era of never-ending coverage and pontification, a newspaper – whether in print or online – still has the ability to cut through the noise and get everybody on the same page, if only for a moment. That's no small feat. If the day ever comes when that doesn't happen anymore, if the very concept of a newsroom disappears, we know the reporters, editors and photographers will still find a way to do what they do.
It's the people who don't know what it is they've lost that we worry about.

New goal for New York Times: 'Reframe' American history, and target Trump, too

Texto completo: Perhaps when you think of the founding of the United States, you think of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Federalist Papers. Now, the New York Times wants to "reframe" your understanding of the nation's founding.
In the Times' view (which it hopes to make the view of millions of Americans), the country was actually founded in 1619, when the first Africans were brought to North America, to Virginia, to be sold as slaves.
This year marks the 400th anniversary of that event, and the Times has created something called the 1619 Project. This is what the paper hopes the project will accomplish: "It aims to reframe the country's history, understanding 1619 as our true founding, and placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of black Americans at the very center of the story we tell ourselves about who we are."
Another, more concise statement from the Times: "The goal of The 1619 Project is to reframe American history."
The basic thrust of the 1619 Project is that everything in American history is explained by slavery and race. The message is woven throughout the first publication of the project, an entire edition of the Times magazine. It begins with an overview of race in America — "Our democracy's founding ideals were false when they were written. Black Americans have fought to make them true." — written by Times writer Nikole Hannah-Jones, who on Twitter uses the identity Ida Bae Wells, from the crusading late 19th-early 20th century African American journalist Ida B. Wells.
The essays go on to cover the economy ("If you want to understand the brutality of American capitalism, you have to start on the plantation."), the food we eat ("The sugar that saturates the American diet has a barbaric history as the 'white gold' that fueled slavery."), the nation's physical health ("Why doesn't the United States have universal healthcare? The answer begins with policies enacted after the Civil War."), politics ("America holds onto an undemocratic assumption from its founding: that some people deserve more power than others."), daily life ("What does a traffic jam in Atlanta have to do with segregation? Quite a lot."), and much more.
The Times promises more 1619 Project stories in the future, not just in the paper's news sections, but in the business, sports, travel, and other sections. The Times' popular podcast, The Daily, will also devote time to it.
But a project with the aim of reframing U.S. history has to be more than a bunch of articles and podcasts. A major goal of the 1619 Project is to take the reframing message to schools. The Times has joined an organization called the Pulitzer Center (which, it should be noted, is not the organization that hands out the Pulitzer Prize) to create a 1619 Project curriculum. "Here you will find reading guides, activities, and other resources to bring The 1619 Project into your classroom," the center says in a message to teachers.
The paper also wants to reach into schools itself. "We will be sending some of our writers on multi-city tours to talk to students," Hannah-Jones said recently, "and we will be sending copies of the magazine to high schools and colleges. Because to us, this project really takes wing when young people are able to read this and understand the way that slavery has shaped their country's history."
The project rollout just happened to come at the same time as the leak of a transcript of a Times employee town hall in which the paper's executive editor, Dean Baquet, discussed his "vision" of making race the central theme of Times coverage of the remaining two years of President Trump's term in office.
Baquet spoke frankly about the paper's approach to Trump. For two years, he explained, the Times made a very, very big deal of the Trump-Russia affair. "We built our newsroom to cover one story," Baquet said. But then came the Mueller report, which failed to establish the core allegation against the president: that he and his campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia to fix the 2016 election.
"Now we have to regroup," Baquet told the staff, "and shift resources and emphasis to take on a different story."
That different story is race — and Trump. "We've got to change," Baquet said. "I mean, the vision for coverage for the next two years is what I talked about earlier: How do we cover a guy who makes these kinds of remarks? How do we cover the world's reaction to him? How do we do that while continuing to cover his policies? How do we cover America, that's become so divided by Donald Trump?"
Some on the staff appeared both anguished by the president ("it's a very scary time") and more than ready to make race a key feature of Times coverage.
"I'm wondering to what extent you think that the fact of racism and white supremacy being sort of the foundation of this country should play into our reporting," one staffer asked Baquet. "Just because it feels to me like it should be a starting point, you know? Like these conversations about what is racist, what isn't racist, I just feel like racism is in everything. It should be considered in our science reporting, in our culture reporting, in our national reporting."
The staffer's point brought Baquet back to the paper's new initiative. "One reason we all signed off on The 1619 Project and made it so ambitious and expansive was to teach our readers to think a little bit more like that," Baquet said. "Race in the next year ... is going to be a huge part of the American story. And I mean, race in terms of not only African Americans and their relationship with Donald Trump, but Latinos and immigration."
So the New York Times has two big plans. One would be big enough: to focus on the universe of racism accusations that increasingly surround the president at a time when he just happens to be running for reelection. But the other is even bigger: to "reframe" American history in accordance with the values of New York Times editors. It's an extraordinarily ambitious undertaking for people in what used to be known more simply as the news business.

With an Eye on Greenland, Trump Mixes Real Estate With Diplomacy

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Go ahead and file this one under Stories You Probably Didn't Expect to Read About the White House This Week: President Trump has been thinking about buying Greenland. Greenland says no, absolutely not.
"If he is truly contemplating this, then this is final proof that he has gone mad," Soren Espersen, the foreign affairs spokesman for the populist Danish People's Party, told a Danish broadcaster on Friday. Greenland is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.
Greenland's Foreign Affairs Ministry was a bit less colorful: "We're open for business, not for sale," the agency posted on Twitter.
Both Danish and Greenlandic officials have been up in arms over the news, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, that Mr. Trump, ever the real estate maven, was eyeing the ice-covered island, the largest in the world, as a new property acquisition for the United States.
The president's interest has rattled nerves -- or at least a sense of national pride -- ahead of Mr. Trump's scheduled visit to Denmark next month.
"The thought of Denmark selling 50,000 citizens to the United States is completely ridiculous," Mr. Espersen added.
[Read more about Denmark's chilly reception to the idea of selling Greenland .]
But in Mr. Trump's world, his real estate prowess has never been a laughing matter -- even if his persona as a mogul has at times been based on selective facts. Mr. Trump's past as a New York City developer is a fact he often wistfully references, whether it is at a campaign rally, on Twitter, in the Oval Office, or even next to friendly foreign leaders. In a May news conference in Tokyo alongside Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, Mr. Trump referred to North Korea as "all waterfront property. It's a great location, as we used to say in the real estate business."
In largely off-the-cuff remarks delivered to assembled real estate agents in Washington in May, Mr. Trump told the group he is "always looking at the real estate." Assessing properties is a muscle-memory compulsion he hasn't been able to shake, not even in the White House. "I'll never get it out of my blood," he told the brokers, who heard this and clapped.
"Even as president, I ride down those streets, and I say, 'Wow, is that place nice. Wow, what could you do with that? Look at that site,"' Mr. Trump said. "And then I said, 'Wait a minute, I have to deal with China. Forget about this now."'
Still, the idea of buying Greenland apparently has kept recirculating in his mind. What could be the appeal? Sure, it is the largest island in the world, with (Arctic) ocean views and the world's only Arctic grass golf course. But there is no private land ownership in Greenland. And it survives in large part through support from Denmark: An annual block grant worth roughly $ 600 million accounts for more than half of Greenland's public budget. It doesn't exactly fit the "Make America Great Again" ethos.
The exact provenance of Mr. Trump's interest is murky, but one person who has heard the president talk about it said that he has brought up the idea of a possible purchase -- albeit fleetingly -- since the first year of his presidency. That person, a former senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said Mr. Trump never spoke at length about buying the island, and the context of the conversation centered around the potential of Greenland's untapped natural resources.
The shrinking ice sheets surrounding Greenland have caught the attention of other Trump administration officials who see potential. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in May during an address in Finland to the Arctic Council that he saw new trade opportunities in the Arctic.
"It houses 13 percent of the world's undiscovered oil, 30 percent of its undiscovered gas, an abundance of uranium, rare earth minerals, gold, diamonds, and millions of square miles of untapped resources, fisheries galore," Mr. Pompeo said of the Arctic region.
About 80 percent of Greenland is covered in ice, said Jon Gertner, who wrote "The Ice at the End of the World: An Epic Journey into Greenland's Buried Past and Our Perilous Future." Although China has expanded its efforts to mine the Arctic, Mr. Gertner said that it remains largely difficult to extract the materials for profit.
"I suppose if you look at the world in terms of natural resources and development, rather than technology and skills," Mr. Gertner said, "it's an older, almost antiquated way of looking at things."
On Friday, the White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would bring up his interest on his coming trip to Denmark, when he is scheduled to visit with the queen. A spokesman at the Danish Embassy in Washington pointed to the embassy's Twitter account, which said Greenland "is not for sale neither in dollars, yuans or roubles," referring to the currencies of the United States, Russia and China -- three countries currently vying for strategic dominance of the Arctic.
Others briefed on Mr. Trump's potential desire for Greenland told The New York Times on Thursday that his interest was born out of national security concerns. There is precedent for this: Since World War II, the land and water of the Arctic have been staked out by countries competing for dominance, with tensions ramping up during the Cold War.
In the 1950s, under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the United States built Thule Air Base, a military installation on Greenland, 750 miles north of the Arctic Circle. In 1968, the United States risked a global catastrophe and strained relations with Denmark when a bomber carrying four nuclear bombs crashed into a fjord. Under Mr. Trump, the upgraded air base houses a squadron of military officers whose role is to monitor and respond to ballistic missile threats against the United States.
If he ever actually made an offer, Mr. Trump wouldn't be the first president to do so: In 1946, James F. Byrnes, the secretary of state under President Harry S. Truman, made an offer to the Danish foreign minister to buy the territory at a meeting of the United Nations in New York.
That transaction didn't go far, either. Back then, as now, Denmark was not interested in selling.

U.S. Sale of Fighter Jets to Taiwan Could Complicate Trade War With China

Texto completo: The Trump administration is moving forward with an $ 8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, American officials said Friday. The move is certain to further anger China at a time when a long-running trade war between Washington and Beijing has upended relations between the world's two largest economies and contributed to stock market turmoil.
The sale of 66 jets to Taiwan would be the largest or one of the largest single arms package transactions between the United States and the democratic, self-governing island. The State Department told Congress Thursday night, right after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had signed a memo approving the sale, officials said. Congress is not expected to object to the move.
For weeks, lawmakers from both parties had accused the administration of delaying the sale to avoid jeopardizing trade negotiations or to use it as a bargaining chip.
But trade talks in Shanghai at the end of July led nowhere, and President Trump said earlier this month that the United States would impose a 10 percent tariff on an additional $ 300 billion worth of Chinese imports on Sept. 1. He then partly reversed himself over concerns about the impact on Americans. He decided on Aug. 13 that he would hold back on tariffs on consumer goods until after the start of the Christmas shopping season.
Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, a foreign policy hawk, has been a longtime advocate of arms sales to Taiwan and has pushed for greater United States support for its government. Some analysts suggest China could retaliate by punishing American companies with sanctions, which it did last month.
On Friday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, was asked at a news conference in Beijing about the potential sale of fighter jets, hours before the news emerged of Mr. Trump's final decision. She said the United States was violating China's sovereignty and interfering in its internal affairs with arms sales to Taiwan.
She said that Beijing would take unspecified "countermeasures" and stressed that the United States would be responsible for the consequences.
The decision to proceed was first reported Friday by The Washington Post. Communist Party officials in Beijing have strongly objected for months to the package, which has been a longstanding request from Taiwan.
Chinese leaders have insisted for decades that they will reunify Taiwan with China. Taiwan has had de facto independence since 1949 and is supported by the United States.
As American administrations normalized diplomatic relations with China, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to set legal guidelines for ties with Taiwan. The act says the United States government must "provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character."
The department gave informal notification of the sale on Thursday to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Once those committees tell the department to move ahead, which would probably happen within days or weeks, the agency would give formal notification to Congress and await any objections within 30 days.
Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he welcomed the proposed sale. "These fighters are critical to improving Taiwan's ability to defend its sovereign airspace, which is under increasing pressure from the People's Republic of China," Mr. Risch said.
The State Department said Friday that it did not comment on arms sales before formal notification to Congress.
Members of Congress expect the entire process to take place without hitches because there is strong bipartisan support for Taiwan and for the United States to take a forceful stand against China.
Congressional officials told The New York Times in late July that trade negotiators had persuaded Mr. Trump to delay the F-16 jet sale. Lawmakers had expected Mr. Pompeo to give the congressional committees at least informal notification by mid-July, before Congress went into recess, but that did not happen.
The jets would be the fourth package of arms sales to Taiwan from the Trump administration. The first two packages totaled less than $ 2 billion. On July 8, the Trump administration told Congress it was moving ahead with a $ 2.2 billion package that consisted mainly of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks.
In his first term, President Barack Obama approved two large packages worth a total of $ 12 billion, then moved on sales of less than $ 2 billion in 2015. President George W. Bush approved packages worth less than $ 5 billion total in his first term, then pushed through sales worth more than $ 10 billion in his second term.
All recent administrations have taken into account the timing of arms sales to Taiwan in order to avoid upsetting Beijing at critical moments.
"There is never a good time to sell arms to Taiwan, but this timing is probably the worst possible choice," said Evan S. Medeiros, professor in Asian studies at Georgetown University and senior Asia director on Mr. Obama's National Security Council. "Trade talks will stall, China will try to hit American companies hard and Chinese will see a conspiratorial link between U.S. support for Taiwan and Hong Kong."
The Chinese government has blamed the United States for the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, though Mr. Trump has not made any strong statements in support of the protesters. Mr. Bolton has forcefully warned Beijing against any potential crackdown. He and other senior foreign policy advisers have urged Mr. Trump to declare a similar position on humanitarian grounds. Lawmakers from both parties and policy experts have also called for the president to advocate human rights.
"President Trump should not be equivocating on this," said Kelly Magsamen, a senior Asia policy official in the Pentagon during the Obama administration. "He should be using the power of his office to press Xi Jinping to avoid a violent escalation. Instead, he's sending all the opposite signals and pretending he has no influence."
Mr. Trump's top foreign policy aides generally see China as the greatest strategic rival to the United States and advocate aggressive positions. Mr. Trump has a transactional view of China and is focused almost entirely on narrowing the trade deficit. He has said China and the United States are "strategic partners" and expresses admiration for Mr. Xi, saying they "will always be friends."
At the urging of officials concerned about the trade talks, the administration has refrained from enacting sanctions against Chinese officials deemed responsible for the detention of one million or more Muslims. Human rights advocates are pressing the administration to move ahead with those.
Some analysts said despite the growing acrimony, Washington and Beijing might be able to keep the dispute over the Taiwan arms sales separate from the difficult trade negotiations.
"China will condemn the sale, of course," said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior Asia adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "But Beijing's objections are primarily political, not military. This will not likely derail the trade talks unless China is looking for an excuse to not hold them."

Texto completo: The purveyors of Strawberry Milk, Peach Madness and Froopy (tastes like Froot Loops) e-cigarette pods are having a very good year.
After Juul Labs, under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, stopped selling most of its hugely popular flavored nicotine pods in stores last fall, upstart competitors swooped in to grab the shelf space. Trumpeting their own fruity and candy-flavored pods as compatible with Juul devices, they have seen their sales soar.
The proliferation of "Juul-alikes" is not only complicating Juul's efforts to clean up its tarnished image but also shows just how entrenched the youth vaping problem has become and that voluntary measures are unlikely to solve it.
When Juul agreed to discontinue store sales of its fruit and dessert flavors, it said it would continue selling them online and strengthen the age verification process on its website.
"If Juul's voluntary actions were working, youths would not still be using their products at epidemic rates," said Chris Bostic, deputy director for policy of Action on Smoking & Health. "We can't rely on the companies alone to self-regulate. That's where the government needs to step in."
Exactly how willing the Trump administration is to step in is up in the air. In the last few weeks of his tenure at the FDA, former Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued a proposal requiring that stores sequester flavored e-cigarettes, except menthol, mint and tobacco, to areas off-limits to minors. Retailers, among them convenience stores and gas stations, would be expected to verify the age of their customers.
But the details of the proposal were vague, and with Gottlieb's departure, it's unclear how federal policy might change, although Acting Commissioner Norman E. Sharpless has said he is working on finalizing the plan and supported Gottlieb's e-cigarette crackdown.
Juul has filed numerous lawsuits, and complaints with the International Trade Commission, seeking to beat back the cheaper copycat devices and pods.
"If the box isn't around, the parent would say it's a Juul pod, but it's not us," said Matthew Hult, a Juul lawyer. "It injects confusion and tarnishes the Juul brand."
The company is also targeting sellers of counterfeit vaping devices and pods sold under the Juul name and training federal customs officials to catch them at ports of entry.
Juul said its concern was less about losing market share than about further damaging its reputation at a time when the company is trying to convince the public that it really does not want minors to vape and that it is working to prevent them from doing so.
Juul's vaping products have been on the market only since 2015, but the sleek devices, sometimes called "the iPhones of e-cigarettes," have become so popular, particularly with young people, that the company now has more than 70% of the e-cigarette market.
Many public health and school officials believe Juul's early marketing campaigns, which highlighted the "coolness" of the devices, helped make them fashionable with teenagers and led to rising nicotine addiction among young people who had never smoked. The FDA and some state attorneys general are investigating the company's marketing practices.

Timothy Egan: The Great Western Public Land Robbery

Texto completo: Imagine if the head of Philip Morris were put in charge of the American Cancer Society. Imagine he had spent his career trying to fight cancer cures, while promoting one of the world’s leading carcinogens. For good measure, he mocked the mission of his new employer and insulted the prayers of those looking for hope.
No, I’m not talking about Ken Cuccinelli, the acting chief of federal immigration services, who wants to rewrite the poem on the Statue of Liberty to say something like: Keep out, wretched masses. Only well-off whites are welcome here.
The gallery of awful human beings, monumental incompetents, wife-beaters, frauds and outright criminals appointed to high positions in the Trump administration is large and varied. As wanted posters, they would fill an entire post office wall.
But you have to go pretty deep into the ranks of the Worst People to find someone equal to the man Donald Trump has now put in charge of your public lands — William Perry Pendley. This is another Onion headline that writes itself: Trump’s pick for public lands doesn’t believe in public lands.
The man now overseeing 248 million acres owned by every American citizen is a mad-dog opponent of the very idea of shared space in the great outdoors. He has spent his professional life chipping away — in court, in public forums, in statehouses — at one of the most cherished of American birthrights.
It’s easy to overlook the latest villain from this White House because the pipeline from hell just keeps churning them out. At the top, the occupant of the Oval Office never stops debasing his office: the racism, the nut-job conspiracy theories, the thumbs-up pictures with newly orphaned babies — and that was just during the last week or so.
But behind the tragicomedy of this presidency, some laser-focused opportunists have been cleaning up. Opponents of public health and safety, of clean water, open space and a chemical-free food chain have never had a better chance to run the show.
This week, it was a rollback of the Endangered Species Act, the most powerful environmental law in history, a statutory savior of bald eagles, grizzly bears and countless other vital links in the web of life. Could anything be more Trumpian than going after the law that saved the national bird?
Weakening the Endangered Species Act by executive fiat is illegal on the face of it, but the law has never stopped this administration cold in its tracks. While the courts sort it out, the natural world slips further into peril. In May, a United Nations report found that 1 million plant and animal species are on the verge of extinction. And for those of you who think you can take refuge in one of the new gilded bunkers built for the rich and apocalyptic, this report had direct implications for human survival as well.
The Trump strategy is to destroy from within. He has a secretary of state who doesn’t believe in diplomacy, an attorney general who scoffs at lawbreakers in the executive branch and now a man who opposes public lands to run the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees an area nearly 50% larger than the state of Texas.
Pendley spent decades suing the government for trying to protect fish and wildlife and clean water. “The Founding Fathers intended all lands owned by the federal government to be sold,” he wrote in 2016. He’s also expressed sympathy for the deadbeat rancher Cliven Bundy, a hero of anti-public land terrorists. And he’s mocked Native American religious claims to sacred sites.
Now, he’s free to fulfill the wish list of his former industrial clients. He’s the land bureau’s acting director, just like Cuccinelli at immigration. It’s another Trump tactic to put people in temporary charge of important arms of government, hacks who could never be approved by Congress. In the short term, they do enough damage to satisfy their big-money handlers.
Pendley was given this powerful perch by way of executive order orchestrated by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist who is now doing the work of his ex-clients on the taxpayer’s dime.
Americans, by huge margins, love their public land — a sentiment shared by Trump voters. In the West, where the bureau’s land includes prime habitat for wildlife, and a favored open range for hunters, anglers, hikers and birders, Trump’s policies could cost Republicans Senate seats in Montana, Colorado and even Texas.
But what’s good in the political backlash to bad policies still leaves us at a dangerous moment for nature. Trump has gutted two national monuments in the West, the largest environmental rollback in history. And he’s given fresh life to a colossal mine that could imperil the world’s largest wild salmon fishery, in Alaska’s Bristol Bay.
I was in Montana last week, sitting around a campfire after a day spent hiking and swimming in a public forest full of summer enchantment. My Montana family members and I were talking about how the rich pay $1,500 a day to go “glamping” in this Last Best Place. We had it free — the forest, the river, a meadow bursting with wildflowers and huckleberries — for now.

Medical Examiner Rules Epstein Death A Suicide By Hanging

Texto completo: NEW YORK - Jeffrey Epstein’s prison death has been ruled a suicide by hanging, the medical examiner’s office said Friday.
Epstein, 66, was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on Aug. 10, touching off outrage and disbelief over how such a high-profile prisoner, known for socializing with powerful people including presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton, could have gone unwatched.
The Bureau of Prisons said Epstein had apparently killed himself, but that didn’t squelch conspiracy theories about his death.
Epstein, who was charged with sexually abusing numerous underage girls over several years, had been placed on suicide watch last month after he was found on his cell floor on July 23 with bruising on his neck.
But multiple people familiar with operations at the jail say he was taken off the watch after about a week and put back in a high-security housing unit where he was less closely monitored, but still supposed to be checked on every 30 minutes.
Attorney General William Barr says officials have uncovered “serious irregularities” at the jail. The FBI and the Justice Department’s inspector general are both investigating Epstein’s death.
Jail guards on duty the night of Epstein’s death are suspected of falsifying log entries to show they were checking on inmates every half-hour as required, according to several people familiar with the matter.
A guard in Epstein’s unit was working a fifth straight day of overtime and another guard was working mandatory overtime, the people said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because the lacked authorization to publicly discuss the investigation.
U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who is in charge of the criminal case against Epstein, asked the jail’s warden this week for answers about the earlier episode, writing in a letter Monday that it had “never been definitively explained.”
The warden replied that an internal investigation was completed but that he couldn’t provide information because the findings were being incorporated into investigations into Epstein’s death.
The Associated Press often does not report details of suicide methods, but has made an exception because Epstein’s cause of death is pertinent to the ongoing investigations.
The Washington Post and The New York Times reported Thursday that the autopsy revealed that several bones in Epstein’s neck had been broken, leading to speculation his death was a homicide.
Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson issued a statement Thursday in response to those articles, saying: “In all forensic investigations, all information must be synthesized to determine the cause and manner of death. Everything must be consistent; no single finding can be evaluated in a vacuum.”
The medical examiner’s ruling came a day after two more women sued Jeffrey Epstein’s estate, saying he sexually abused them.
The suit, filed Thursday in a federal court in New York, claims the women were working as hostesses at a popular Manhattan restaurant in 2004 when they were recruited to give Epstein massages.
One was 18 at the time. The other was 20.
The lawsuit says an unidentified female recruiter offered the hostesses hundreds of dollars to provide massages to Epstein, saying he “liked young, pretty girls to massage him,” and wouldn’t engage in any unwanted touching. The women say Epstein groped them anyway.
One plaintiff now lives in Japan, the other in Baltimore. They seek $100 million in damages, citing depression, anxiety, anger and flashbacks.
Other lawsuits, filed over many years by other women, accused him of hiring girls as young as 14 or 15 to give him massages, then subjecting them to sex acts.

Texto completo: China Shanghai is not giving up on solving the city’s waste problem. In July, it introduced its first trash sorting program. The goal is to increase recycling and reduce waste that goes into landfills as it’s running out of room to dispose of trash. The city was part of a pilot municipal recycling program in 2000, but residents were unable to adapt. The stakes are higher this time around; the program has a grading system that gives redeemable points for successful sorting and fines for mistakes. Months prior to the program’s launch, millions of educational flyers were distributed, and choreographed dances with sorting bins promoted the shift. Experts say initiatives such as this can take a generation to accomplish. (The Associated Press)
U.S. Virgin Islands Lawmakers in the U.S. Virgin Islands banned coral-damaging sunscreens, one of the first bans of its kind in the Caribbean. Effective in March, importing and using sunscreen with certain chemicals is prohibited. Hawaii enacted a similar ban that will take effect January 2021. The Caribbean has already lost 80% of its coral reefs, and studies show that common chemicals in sunscreen that wash off in the water make coral susceptible to bleaching. Lawmakers hope the ban will lead to cleaner waters, promote coral growth, and support other ecological conservation efforts. (National Parks Traveler)
Worldwide A study shows that human rights have economic value. Countries that support women’s economic and social rights are healthier and develop more sustainably. Data examined from 162 countries show a correlation between a woman’s economic and social rights and the country’s ranking on the United Nations Human Development Index and its people’s health. The study revealed that women with limited access to financial capital, skill training, and social communities are not as able to contribute to a country’s development. Meanwhile promotion of women’s rights improves a country’s life expectancy and disease prevention. (The BMJ)
Ethiopia Ethiopia is working to reverse deforestation. State officials say more than 350 million trees were planted on July 29, a record. A century of logging and land development has reduced the country’s forest cover from 33% to less than 4%, so Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed spearheaded the campaign to promote reforestation nationwide. Mr. Abiy is taking a different approach from previous forest restoration efforts: The government is engaging communities to ensure that young trees survive. Meanwhile, organizations are working with locals to ensure less dependence on timber and to develop alternative trades such as beekeeping and the manufacturing of bamboo furniture. (The New York Times)

Estonia The oldest town in the Baltic nations is upgrading its Soviet-era housing. Located in southern Estonia, Tartu has 17 apartment blocks that are being transformed into more sustainable residences. The project is part of a larger European Union-led initiative for sustainable cities. Apartments were quickly built to cope with a postwar housing shortage in the 1950s, and have poor energy efficiency. With updates to insulation, ventilation, and heating, each unit is expected to save two-thirds of the energy it currently consumes. (Deutsche Welle)

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas on Thursday compelling President Trump's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and a former White House aide to testify publicly about actions taken by the president that could constitute obstruction of justice.
The summons set up another potentially high-stakes, made-for-TV hearing around the findings of the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, when Congress returns next month from its summer recess. Democratic investigators have portrayed this fall as a make-or-break stretch that will determine whether their work ultimately leads to impeachment.
Mr. Lewandowski, who has remained a close informal adviser to the president, is viewed by lawmakers as a particularly valuable witness because of his role in an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Trump in the summer of 2017 to dramatically curtail the special counsel's investigation of Russian election interference and his campaign. Rick A. Dearborn, the White House aide who also received a subpoena on Thursday, was drafted into that effort by Mr. Lewandowski.
[Read the subpoenas for Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Dearborn.]
But there is no guarantee the men will show up on Sept. 17, as directed, or repeat the claims they made to the special counsel even if they do -- underscoring Democrats' challenge building momentum around the case. The White House has repeatedly intervened to try to block or sharply limit the testimony of other witnesses called by the committee.
The committee's chairman, Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, reiterated on Thursday that he believed Mr. Trump would have been prosecuted based on Mr. Mueller's findings but for a Justice Department policy that bars indicting a sitting president. He said that more witnesses and hearings could follow in the coming months, and that Mr. Trump would ultimately be held to account.
"This will help the committee determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment against the president or other Article I remedies," Mr. Nadler said in a statement. "No one is above the law."
The panel has already approved subpoenas for an additional 10 witnesses related to Mr. Mueller's investigation, including Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general; Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who appointed Mr. Mueller; John F. Kelly, the former White House chief of staff; and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser.
And on Thursday, it received additional information from another witness, Hope Hicks, about testimony she gave the committee behind closed doors about her time on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign. The panel had asked Ms. Hicks, the former White House communications director, to clarify what she knew at the time about an illegal scheme to make hush payments to two women in light of new information.
The information, collected during a federal investigation into the payments and unsealed last month, showed that Ms. Hicks had communicated with Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, several times around the time the payments were being negotiated, though in most cases, the data included just dates and times of phone calls and not any information about their content. Ms. Hicks told the committee in June that she did not have advance knowledge of the payments.
In a six-page letter to Mr. Nadler on Thursday, her lawyers, Robert P. Trout and Gloria B. Solomon, wrote that despite the proximity of the calls to negotiations Mr. Cohen was conducting on silencing the women, the communications in question were not about the payments. They also noted that federal prosecutors involved in the case had never taken issue with her testimony.
[Read the letter from Ms. Hicks's lawyers.]
"In sum, the information in the search warrant affidavit is not inconsistent with Ms. Hicks's testimony, and does not establish any lack of candor on her part," the lawyers wrote. "Ms. Hicks took her obligations seriously when she was interviewed by the committee. Her testimony was consistent with her previous statements on these issues and was truthful to the best of her knowledge and recollection."
A spokeswoman for committee Democrats said they would review the letter to determine what steps to take.
Democrats want to explore other areas of investigation with Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Dearborn, including their knowledge of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russians and its views of Russia's efforts to interfere in the race on its behalf. But their principal interest revolves around their knowledge of meetings Mr. Lewandowski had with Mr. Trump in June and July 2017, shortly after he directed his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, to fire Mr. Mueller, an order Mr. McGahn rebuffed.
In his conversation with Mr. Lewandowski, the president "dictated a message" he wanted Mr. Lewandowski to deliver to Mr. Sessions, according to Mr. Mueller's report. The message instructed Mr. Sessions, who was recused from the matter, to declare the special counsel's investigation "very unfair" to the president and then curtail its scope to preventing future interference, effectively ending the scrutiny of Mr. Trump's campaign.
Mr. Trump asked Mr. Lewandowski about the status of the message again a month later, and his former campaign manager advised him that he would deliver it soon. Hours afterward, the president criticized his attorney general in an interview with The New York Times.
Mr. Lewandowski never delivered the message directly to Mr. Sessions, asking Mr. Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do so instead. Mr. Mueller wrote in his report that Mr. Dearborn was uneasy about the request himself and also never delivered it.
For Mr. Lewandowski, the subpoena arrives as he is considering entering a Senate race in his home state, New Hampshire. Mr. Trump all but endorsed him Thursday morning, saying Mr. Lewandowski would be "hard to beat" if he got into the race against Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat.
The White House and lawyers for the two witnesses declined to comment on Thursday on whether their clients would appear at the hearing.
William Coffield, a lawyer for Mr. Dearborn, said he would consult with his client before determining how to reply. Peter Chavkin, a lawyer for Mr. Lewandowski, said that in light of his client's earlier appearances before Congress and Mr. Mueller's investigators, "it is fair to ask: What could be gained from requiring him to appear yet again?"
That line of thinking was echoed by Judiciary Committee Republicans, who in a statement from a spokeswoman, Jessica Andrews, said the committee was wasting "more time and taxpayer dollars as Democrats demand information we already have."
Given the White House's opposition to the panel's inquiry and the president's vow to fight "all the subpoenas," their appearance was far from assured on Thursday.
It would not be difficult for Mr. Trump to try to block Mr. Dearborn's appearance, given his high-level posting in the White House. Presidents have long claimed powers under the Constitution to block Congress from obtaining certain internal executive branch information or the content of communications between the president and top White House aides.
The case for shielding Mr. Lewandowski would be more complicated. Unlike other witnesses, Mr. Lewandowski never worked in Mr. Trump's administration. Democrats say that leaves the president little legal standing to block his appearance. But the White House does not appear to agree.
In a letter to the House Oversight and Reform Committee in June related to a separate matter, Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, argued that communications between Mr. Trump and another outside adviser pursued by the committee "fall squarely within the scope of executive privilege." Presumably, the White House would take the same view of Mr. Lewandowski.
If it does, the case would almost certainly end up in the federal courts, where Democrats are testing other claims made by the Trump administration related to their investigation.
Last week, the committee sued to enforce a subpoena for testimony from Mr. McGahn, who Democrats consider the most important witness in an obstruction of justice case. But the real target of the suit was broader and could affect a handful of potential witnesses in addition to Mr. McGahn: the House wants a judge to strike down the Trump administration's claim that top presidential aides are "absolutely immune" from its subpoenas.

Thomas Friedman Explains How ‘Deep Tech’ Drove US, China Into an Ugly Trade War

Texto completo: Fourteen years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman’s book, The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century, became an international bestseller. The book, published in the aftermath of the burst of the “dot com” bubble in America, analyzed the trend of globalization that Friedman predicted would break down all barriers in the cross-border exchange of goods, services and knowledge.
Fast forward a decade later, however: while we are still in the early phase of the 21st century, the world we live in today looks everything but “flat.” Quite the contrary, world leaders, particularly those of the U.S. and China, are raising the barriers of trading goods and services, curbing competitors from advancing their technologies while exacerbating the ideological divide between their own people and those of others.
SEE ALSO: Why Tesla No Longer Needs to Worry About the US-China Trade War
What does the Pulitzer-winning world affairs commentator make of all this? In an opinion piece last week, Friedman identified the key force forming over the past decade which has driven the U.S. and China into an ugly war about trade, tech and politics today: China no longer wants to sell the same types of goods it has been selling to American for decades.
“The character of U.S.-China trade changed—it went ‘deep,'” Friedman wrote.
“For the first three decades [of China’s economic opening], U.S.-China trade could be summarized as America bought T-shirts, tennis shoes and toys from China, and China bought soybeans and Boeing jetliners from America,” he went on to explain. “And as long as that was the case, we did not care whether the Chinese government was communist, capitalist, authoritarian, libertarian or vegetarian.”
But over the last 10 years, China gradually grew capable of making more sophisticated products. In 2015, China’s President Xi Jinping, who took power in 2012 and is set to stay in power indefinitely, laid out a 10-year plan called “Made in China 2025” that aims to make China a world leader in manufacturing high-tech products, such as computer chips, software, 5G networks and robots.
Friedman characterized these new products China wants to export as “deep technology” that can “get embedded into your infrastructure, your factory and your community” and potentially be used to tap American society for intelligence or malicious purposes.
“Our relationship with China is very different from the one we had with the Soviet Union during the Cold War,” Friedman explained. “We were not economically and technologically interdependent with the Russians. We are with China. And now that China can get as deep into America as Apple is into China, the difference in our values—China is a nontransparent communist society, and ours is a transparent democratic society—starts to matter.”
“When you are trading deep technologies, ‘trust’ matters like never before. We cannot sell to each other, and buy from each other, these deep technologies, at scale, without higher levels of trust and shared values,” he added.
In that context, Friedman pointed out that both China’s President Xi and President Donald Trump have gone too far in seeking a peaceful solution. Notably, the ongoing tit-for-tat tariff war (which has recently devolved into a currency war) and the U.S.’s heavy penalty on Chinese tech giants have hurt both economies badly and don’t leave either side much room for a decent way out.
“If President Trump and President Xi Jinping don’t find a way to defuse it soon, we’re going to get where we’re going—fracturing the globalization system that has brought the world more peace and prosperity over the last 70 years than at any other time in history,” Friedman warned.

Anthony Scaramucci's comment on Trump 'mentally declining' signals his own fading career in Washington

Texto completo: Anthony Scaramucci must have really seen his phone calls from journalists dry up in recent days. That would explain why he broke the emergency glass to bring out the tried and true "Trump is mentally declining" tool.
The playbook to get noticed by the media in President Trump’s Washington is so worn-out and old that I’m worried New York Times reporter Ali Watkins might want to date it. When your status in the swamp is just on the verge of "flameout," you have two options to give it one final boost: call Trump a racist or else question his mental state.
During an interview with Eric Bolling on Wednesday, Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director just long enough to check out the office Keurig, called Trump “nuts,” “completely crazy,” and a “narcissist.” He also said Trump was “mentally declining.” In short, he repeated everything David Brooks said in 2015.
White House adviser Kellyanne Conway’s husband George Conway got in on that sweet action, tweeting Thursday morning that Trump is suffering from a “deteriorating mental capacity,” which will surely serve as a preview to the longer piece he’ll write for the Washington Post saying the same thing.
In similar fashion, this is how Michael Wolff made his name in 2018. (By the way, have you heard much out of Wolff since then?) And it’s what every pundit, commentator, and journalist needing to boost his own profile did thereafter. How many times did we read stories about administration officials potentially invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office because he’s supposedly “mentally unfit” to do the job?
It all comes to nothing, and that is especially true when it comes from Scaramucci and Conway. The former was almost literally thrown out of the White House after he called up a reporter and went on a maniacal rant about how he was going to fire everyone. Conway has called Trump a racist — but then, what does that say about Conway’s own wife, Trump’s most loyal defender?
If we’re going to continue acting like accusations of Trump’s mental state are new, rather than ploys for media attention, can't the allegations at least come from people who aren’t so crazy?

Texto completo: COLUMBUS - The Quality Rock & Roll Revue features soulful rock and roll songs from throughout Nick Lowe's career – including his biggest hits – as well as selections from two recent EPs recorded with Los Straitjackets. Los Straitjackets provide backup for Nick as well as perform a short segment of their own instrumental surf guitar twangers.
CAPA presents Nick Lowe's Quality Rock & Roll Revue starring Los Straitjackets at the Davidson Theatre (77 S. High St.) at 8 p.m. Sept. 24. Tickets are $35 and $40 and can be purchased in-person at the CAPA Ticket Center (39 E. State St.), online at www.capa.com, or by phone at (614) 469-0939 or (800) 982-2787.
Lowe has made his mark as a producer (Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, Pretenders, The Damned), a songwriter of at least three songs you know by heart, a short-lived pop star, and a long-term musicians' musician.
From 1995's "The Impossible Bird" to 2011's "The Old Magic," Lowe has turned out a fantastic string of albums, each one devised in his West London home and recorded with a core of musicians who possess the same veteran savvy. Lowe brings wit and understated excellence to every performance, leading Ben Ratliff of the New York Times to describe his live show as "elegant and nearly devastating."
His new four-song EP, "Tokyo Bay," features Los Straitjackets as his backing band.
Los Straitjackets are the leading practitioners of the lost art of instrumental guitar. With the music of the Ventures, The Shadows, and with Link Wray and Dick Dale as a jumping-off point, the band has taken their unique, high energy brand of original rock and roll around the world. Clad in their trademark Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling masks, the "Jackets" have delivered their trademark guitar licks to 16 albums, thousands of concerts, and dozens of films and TV shows.
Their most recent album, What's So Funny 'Bout Peace Love & Los Straitjackets, consists of instrumental covers of Nick Lowe songs.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- Shortly before a federal judge sentenced him on Wednesday to life in prison for his role in the deadly 2007 shooting of dozens of unarmed Iraqis in Baghdad, Nicholas A. Slatten, a former Blackwater security contractor, stood in a tan jumpsuit and defiantly proclaimed that he was an innocent victim of Justice Department prosecutors run amok.
"This is a miscarriage of justice that will not stand," said Mr. Slatten, who in December was convicted by a jury of murdering an Iraqi civilian in Nisour Square, the act prosecutors said kicked off the chaotic hail of machine-gun fire and grenades targeting other civilians by guards in Mr. Slatten's convoy that left 10 women, two men and two children dead, and 18 other people injured.
But the trial judge, Royce C. Lamberth of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, rejected Mr. Slatten's assertion of innocence, including a reference to a fellow Blackwater guard's statement that it was he, not Mr. Slatten, who fired the initial shot that killed the driver of a white Kia sedan in the traffic circle, Ahmed Haithem Ahmed Al Rubia'y, 19.
"The court's view of the evidence is the same as that of the jury," Judge Lamberth said, declaring that the other guard's statement was an "effort to mislead authorities about what was going on," and that it was Mr. Slatten who "shot Mr. Al Rubia'y between the eyes and killed him" without provocation.
The government had hired Blackwater Security to escort State Department officials through a chaotic war zone at the height of the Iraq insurgency. One of the darkest episodes in the conflict, the massacre of civilians became a charged symbol of American abuses and prompted a rethinking of American reliance on contractors in war zones. It also strained relations between the United States and the Iraqi government: The Iraqis wanted to prosecute the contractors, but the Americans insisted on handling it.
Judge Lamberth rejected a constitutional challenge by the defense to a law mandating that Mr. Slatten receive a life sentence for the first-degree murder conviction, which the judge formally imposed. Mr. Slatten swiftly said, "God bless you, sir," before guards led him out of the courtroom.
But his defense lawyer and friends and family from Tennessee, many of whom gave emotional statements declaring that Mr. Slatten was a patriot whom they believed to be innocent, made clear that they would keep fighting, including by asking the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to overturn the sentence and the verdict.
Left unmentioned in the courtroom were signs that President Trump might be weighing whether to grant a pardon to Mr. Slatten, as well as to several servicemen accused or convicted of war crimes. The New York Times reported in May that the White House had requested paperwork about his and a handful of other cases, according to two United States officials.
In his statement, Mr. Slatten also accused the government of covering up classified evidence that would have proved his claim, which prosecutors rejected, that insurgents started the Nisour Square episode. For Mr. Slatten's supporters who stressed his prior combat tours with the Army before he went to work for Blackwater, that theory dovetailed with a recurring theme: the extreme peril of navigating a combat zone amid an insurgency, which Mr. Slatten's father said many of those now judging his son did not understand.
But Judge Lamberth took exception to that, saying he had served a tour in the Vietnam War and had been in many dangerous situations. Nevertheless, he said troops must rely on each other and obey the rules to ensure that innocent civilians were not unnecessarily harmed. In the case of the Nisour Square massacre, he said, the evidence made clear that there had been no incoming fire against the convoy and that "there was no necessity" to shoot Mr. Al Rubia'y.
One security contractor involved in the episode, Jeremy Ridgeway, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and cooperated with prosecutors. But the cases against others involved in the shooting proved difficult.
A federal judge in 2009 threw out the indictment of five contractors, citing a "reckless violation of the defendants' constitutional rights." The judge said that investigators, prosecutors and government witnesses had inappropriately relied on statements that the guards had been compelled to make in debriefings by the State Department shortly after the shootings.
A new prosecution team was able to revive a case against four of them, and in a trial in 2014, a jury found Mr. Slatten guilty of murder and convicted three colleagues -- Dustin L. Heard, Evan S. Liberty and Paul A. Slough -- of voluntary manslaughter and using a machine gun to carry out a violent crime. Mr. Slatten was given life in prison, and the others were sentenced to 30 years in prison.
But charging the defendants with machine-gun offenses, a crime not meant for battlefield situations, was controversial, even in the Justice Department. In 2017, a federal appeals court ruled that the machine-gun charges and offenses were "grossly disproportionate to their culpability for using government-issued weapons in a war zone," and said that Mr. Slatten should not have been tried alongside the other three.
The court ordered a do-over trial for Mr. Slatten and vacated the sentences of the three colleagues, deferring their resentencings until after his case is concluded. But in 2018, the first attempt to retry him ended in a mistrial, with the jury deadlocked after his defense lawyer stressed testimony from another contractor who testified that he, not Mr. Slatten, shot first. But prosecutors tried a third time, and won another guilty verdict against Mr. Slatten for first-degree murder.
Denouncing that outcome on Wednesday, Mr. Slatten also noted that prosecutors had offered to let him plead guilty to a manslaughter charge, but that he rejected the offer because, he said, he was innocent.
Judge Lamberth suggested that that level of charge might have been appropriate, but said that Mr. Slatten had decided to take the "all or nothing" gamble of going to trial on a more serious murder charge, and "got what he gambled for."

Texto completo: (TriceEdneyWire.com/ GIN) - The New York Times is still recovering from the verbal bashing it received from Kenyan writers shocked and angered by the paper's outdated references to Africa in a recent ad for the job of Nairobi Bureau Chief.
Has far has Africa come, wondered educator Alice Wairimu Nderitu since the day when posters portrayed wild animals with the title "The Highlands of British East Africa as a Winter Home for Aristocrats"?
The Times job opening is described as an exotic African assignment - "from the deserts of Sudan and the pirate seas of the Horn of Africa, down through the forests of Congo and the shores of Tanzania."
"It is an enormous patch of vibrant, intense and strategically important territory with many vital story lines," the ad continues, "including terrorism, the scramble for resources, the global contest with China and the constant push-and-pull of democracy versus authoritarianism."
At this point, Wairimu Nderitu said the Times job description sounded like a call for a colonial settler, not a professional journalist.
Twitter buzzed with reactions: "If you are rearing to apply for this Bureau Chief job you should know what kind of stories New York Times is looking for. The darkness of Africa!" declared computer forensic guru George Njororge.
"Hard to distinguish this nytimes ad from a call to join a 19th Century expedition with Livingstone & Stanley," proclaimed Travis L. Adkins, lecturer on African & Security Studies at Georgetown University.
"A reminder that the NYTimes already has a dubious reputation in Kenya," Prof. Ken Opalo, recalling the furious debate over the Times printing a photo of two dead men slumped over their seats at a cafe.
"The biggest losers from this sort of madness," Opalo said, "would not be Eastern Africans, but the daily's American audience who "continue to be fed [and believe] myths and as a result are increasingly economically [and] geopolitically uncompetitive in the region".
"When someone sent me this New York Times ad, I had to read it twice just to confirm that the kind of journalist they are looking for is one who would just focus on the negative news in this region," added Oliver Mathenge, digital editor at Radio Africa.
Kayode Ogundamisi, anti-corruption campaigner, said: "Requirements to work as @nytimes journalist in Africa. You have the ability to focus on the negative and "occasional good news".
"Unexpected stories of hope. That is how much @ nytimes despise Africa."
In a belated response, international editor Michael Slackman owned up to approving the ad that was full of cliched descriptions of the continent.
The ad was the result of taking a short cut, he said. Rather than write a new job description, a posting from about 18 months ago went out. Still, he insisted, The Times "was "committed to covering Africa, not as if it were some stereotype, but because it matters".

How Shaked came to dominate the right-wing religious camp in Israel

Texto completo: Late last month, as Israel prepared for yet another round of elections, Ayelet Shaked ascended to the leadership of the United Right, a joint list comprising the primary factions representing the nation's religious Zionist community.
While women have led Israeli political parties, none has ever risen to the pinnacle of political power in a bloc representing the traditionally patriarchal Orthodox community.
And even more remarkable, the 43-year-old mother of two is a secular Jew from Tel Aviv.
So who is Ayelet Shaked and how did she overcome decades of political tradition?
Growing up as a middle-class child in the Tel Aviv of the 1980s, Shaked could have been expected to develop into a left-leaning Labor or Meretz voter, a proponent of two states and liberal policies. But as Shaked told The New York Times in 2015, she experienced a personal revelation at the age of 8 when she watched Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir debate an opponent on television: She was swayed by his nationalistic perspective.
During their mandatory military service, some Israelis tend to shift to the right, at least for a while, and a stint as an instructor in the storied Golani infantry brigade helped Shaked strengthen her conservative political outlook.
"I just realized there will not be a solution right now," she told The Times.
Like the coalition she represents, Shaked is staunchly pro-settlement and hawkish on defense.
Although she studied computer engineering and began her career working for Texas Instruments, Shaked pivoted to politics in 2006, going to work for then-opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu as his bureau chief. She brought along with her the future Jewish Home party head and frequent collaborator Naftali Bennett, helping him make a similar transition from high tech to the dog-eat-dog world of Israeli parliamentary politics.
The two worked for Netanyahu for four years but left following a reported falling-out with his wife, Sara. In 2012, Bennett and Shaked entered the world of right-wing, pro-settlement politics. That was the year that Jewish Home - a party composed of the old National Religious Party and several smaller right-wing factions - held its first open primaries. Bennett, religiously modern Orthodox and politically hawkish, entered the Knesset in 2013 at the top of its list. Shaked took its fifth seat.
By the 2015 primary Shaked, having only finished her first term in the Knesset, was popular enough with the party base that she came in second behind Bennett, establishing her position as a leader of the nationalist camp. In a party traditionally led by older, gray-haired men, Shaked at 39 not only was an ideological torchbearer but literally a fresh face: a young, stylish woman.
A stint as the country's justice minister under Netanyahu further cemented her popularity. With mixed success, Shaked sought to overhaul an activist judiciary that in her view handcuffed the military and undermined the right-wing elected government. She also helped pass a controversial bill that defined Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people. Supporters said it made an obvious reality into law, while opponents attacked it for prioritizing an ethnic identity over democracy.
Her critics say she is a threat to that democracy.
"While Shaked was 'polite,' she was also a bulldozer that would run roughshod over liberal democracy," Tamar Zandberg, a lawmaker representing the liberal Meretz party, said in a Facebook post. Her attempt to remake the judiciary is "not a misunderstanding of what democracy is, it is a desire to destroy it and establish the Jewish state, the settlements, and Jewish supremacy instead of the state of equality."
In March, Shaked's team produced a mock perfume ad featuring "Fascism by Ayelet Shaked" in which she posed like a model while a narrator taunted her liberal critics.
Whatever it takes to win
Both her effectiveness as a politician and Jewish Home's move toward open primaries helped Shaked advance in the religious sector, according to Yair Sheleg, who researches the religious Zionist sector at the Israel Democracy Institute.
In many ways, he said, its followers consider the nationalist aspect of religious Zionism - settling all of biblical Israel, asserting Israel's Jewish character - as more fundamental than the religious aspect. Many leaders in the community "can live with Shaked as the leader because she brings many more voters" than other politicians.
"They are nationalists. They want a right-wing camp to win in the elections and if a secular woman can bring these results, so let it be a secular woman in the leadership," Sheleg said, adding that since the United Right is technically a bloc and not a united party, it is easier for many Orthodox politicians to see Shaked's role in pragmatic terms. After all, they retain control of their factions.
The more moderate religious sectors of Israeli society have increasingly supported a greater role for women in national life. A more traditionalist faction called Chardal, or Zionist ultra-Orthodox, comprises only about 12-15 percent of the national religious community. And some of that group may very well end up voting for smaller arch-nationalist factions like Jewish Power.
Sheleg said that the traditionalist Chardal sector doesn't represent the mainstream. Shaked got an opening, he said, once the average voter, rather than the rabbis and older generation of religiously conservative activists, could vote for party leaders.
"The answer depends on who you ask, but Ayelet Shaked seems to have a good deal of acceptance across much of the national religious sector," agreed Yehoshua Oz, senior adviser at the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security.
"Of course, the national religious camp is far more complex than some assume," he continued, citing a 2014 Israel Democracy Institute study showing that "21 percent of Israelis identify as part of the national-religious sector, and that group has a lot of variety in their views and beliefs across a number of issues."
"What does seem to unite the national religious are political issues, such as considering themselves right-of -center and believing the Law of Return should [extend citizenship only] to those who are Jewish according to Jewish law," or halacha, he said.
Shaked declined an interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. But one source close to Shaked's inner circle agreed with Sheleg, saying that Shaked is "very focused and productive," and worked hard to become "a consensus figure between the parties" in her political camp.
"A lot of people see it as a paradox," the source said. "You see this secular woman from Tel Aviv as the head of a list by and large filled with religious Zionists, but if you speak to each and every one of these people you'll see they have a great deal of respect for her and, if anything, feel more comfortable with her at No. 1 than many of the alternatives."
Conversations with people close to Shaked painted a picture of a woman willing to listen to the unique ideological needs and demands of her constituents, and respect their unique sensibilities. For instance, while she is not personally religious, Shaked makes a point of not giving interviews on Shabbat or publicly eating in non-kosher restaurants.
Shaked "believes in [creating] connections and quiet and thorough work behind the scenes," another source who used to work closely with Shaked told JTA. "Although Ayelet is secular in her personal life, she has great respect for Judaism and rabbis, and she has fought for these values, certainly in the context of the settlement of the Land of Israel."
New elections, a second chance
After the Knesset elections in April, however, Shaked's star appeared to be falling. She and Bennett had split off from Jewish Home to form the New Right party, a secular-religious-nationalist faction. It failed to pass the electoral threshold and gain seats in the parliament.
But after Netanyahu failed to build a governing coalition and new elections were called, Bennett and Shaked threw themselves into rebuilding the right-wing coalition they had abandoned. Despite opposition from the national religious sector's more conservative quarters (one prominent rabbi publicly asserted that "the complex world of politics is no place" for a woman), polling showed she was the most popular of the candidates to lead the new reunited right. After tough negotiations, Jewish Home leader Rabbi Rafi Peretz stepped aside.
"We agreed that out of national responsibility and concern for a right wing government and the religious-Zionist [community] Ayelet will head" the United Right, Peretz explained in a tweet.
Shaked's ascent seems to working its magic for the right: A recent poll shows the United Right winning 12-13 seats in the next Knesset.

Texto completo: The climate change issue is heating up in Pennsylvania this week.
The state on Tuesday became one of 29 states and cities in a suit seeking to prevent the Trump administration from weakening restrictions on coal-burning power plants. It was filed the same day that President Donald Trump was touring the Shell cracker plant in Potter, Beaver County, that will turn a fossil fuel - natural gas liquids - into plastic.
And Wednesday, U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle will host a "Climate Crisis Town Hall" at Soldiers&Sailors Memorial Hall&Museum in Oakland.
The meeting, scheduled from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m., will feature panels discussing the social, economic and political response to climate change. Mr. Doyle, D-Forest Hills, will provide an update on federal actions to address climate change, with time allotted for audience members to ask questions.
"This is an important issue, one we need to start the discussion on and one we need to have to build support for whatever we decide to do legislatively," said Mr. Doyle, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the bipartisan Climate Change Caucus. "Addressing climate change is the most important thing we can do for our kids and our grandchildren and the planet we all live on."
Mr. Doyle said science is clear in saying carbon emissions must be "net zero by 2050" if the planet is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, but "for the last eight years, Republicans have done nothing."
"I hope this town hall can be educational about what's being done on the local and state levels and what are the possible pathways to net carbon zero by 2050, and what changes need to happen to get on that pathway," he said.
It won't be an easy road, he said, but solutions are possible if coalitions are built, technology is developed and government programs are implemented in stages, in much the same way Social Security and Medicare programs were developed over time.
"We need to do the things that can be done and then build on those programs," Mr. Doyle said. "We need to get the train moving and then add to it."
The first panel, moderated by Joylette Portlock, executive director of Sustainable Pittsburgh, will discuss "moving to a greener economy." It includes Jay Whitacre, director of the Wilton E. Scott Institute for Energy Innovation at Carnegie Mellon University; Jenna Cramer, executive director, Green Building Alliance; Craig Glazer, vice president of PJM Interconnection LLC, the region's electric transmission organization; Keith Johnson, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Transportation at the University of Pittsburgh; and Ron Gdovic, chief executive officer of WindStax Energy.
The second panel, moderated by Jamil Bey, chief executive officer of UrbanKind, will focus on state and local action on climate change and include Ashleigh Deemer, of PennEnvironment, a statewide environmental advocacy organization; Patrice Tomcik, Moms Clean Air Force; Grant Ervin, Pittsburgh chief resilience officer and assistant director of city planning; and Zaheen Hussain, sustainability coordinator in Millvale.
The lawsuit that Pennsylvania signed on to, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit by 22 states and seven cities, argues that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should not have replaced the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. That plan had for the first time limited emissions of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.
The suit accuses the Trump administration of ignoring the EPA's responsibility to limit greenhouse gases, claiming it could actually increase air pollution emissions by prolonging the life of old coal-burning power plants.

Texto completo: "Bring yourself back to your awareness," said Sara Auster, a self-proclaimed sound healer, after 45 minutesin a ballroom at a hotel in Ghicago where she created vibrations using crystal bowls and tuning forks as wellas a traditional Indian accordion, known as a shruti box. Seventy-five people got up like a gaggle of toddlers being shaken from a nap.
The session, which cost $30, and was like many popping up in churches, community centers and even some prisons and hospitals. The goal, practitioners say, is to use sound to tackle individual and collective anxiety, depression, insomnia and more.
Recently, musicians like Erykah Badu and the Icelandic band Sigur Ros have also dipped into sound healing.
Over in the tech world, mindfulness in deeply in vogue. Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter, swears by meditation. Since 2016, Auster, 40, has been invited as well to perform for various Google company initiatives. In April, Adrian DiMatteo, a musician in Brooklyn who has a degree in jazz performance, led a sound bath in the Green-point neighborhood of Brooklyn for leaders at Instagram. ("They approached us to do a corporate bonding event, as they're moving towards doing more events without alcohol," DiMatteo said "They had lots of questions about the instruments and the bowls.")
Some health facilities have taken note as well. Auster has performed for Harlem House Clubhouse, an outpatient psychiatric rehabilitation program at Harlem Hospital in New York Darren Austin Hall, a ceremonial musician and sound healer in Toronto, has performed in the atrium of Toronto General Hospital with a Canadian organization called Music Can Heal.
The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has also discussed incorporating sound baths.
Matteo has offered them in the waiting area at NYU Langone through a program called Music That Heals, as well as at Coney Island Hospital and "about a dozen others," he said.
Diane Mandle, who has offered sound healing in Encinitas, California, for 19 years, said: "It's not curing, it's healing." She has also provided sound sessions fin an oncology unit at Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, as well as at a workshop for inmates at the Vista Detention Center.
"Healing is an ongoing process that contributes to a better sense of well-being," Mandle said.
What are sound baths?
Sound baths are an experience in which a group of people gather, often while lying on a mat, to listen to sounds produced through various instruments. There is no licensing procedure for leading sound baths, and though Auster wouldn't say where she received her training, her music background and meditation training are strong influences.
For centuries, various cultures, including my own, South Asian, have used sound as a part of religious ceremonies and prayer, with one goal being to promote and facilitate meditation. In that sense, it's not terribly different from singing hymns in a church. Most religions and cultures use music and sound for spiritual reasons.
But what about the promise of healing? After all, the use of sound is advertised as an activity that can do many things, including "realigning your chakras" and "mind expansion."
"Personally I have an issue with the word 'healer,' which is why I turn down a lot of wellness events," Auster said. "There are all sorts of expectations with that label, and I don't want to be seen as some magical guru person or for people to assume they could not possibly have an understanding of the experience."
Like other forms of music, sound baths bring people together, but with an added meditative element. Anaïs Maviel, a musician in New York, said that she is often asked to perform for grassroots organizations as part of "community-building" efforts.
Does sound have an effect on our health?
One way sound is related to health is through noise pollution: traffic noise; planes flying overhead, loud concerts. The World Health Organization lists noise pollution as an increasing threat to human health, and recently set limits on environmental noise.
This may also explain the boom in ASMR - soothing sounds that, like sound baths, aim to address stress and anxiety. ASMR has become an internet phenomenon, particularly on platforms like YouTube.
A 2013 study of tinnitus, led by David Baguley, a professor of hearing sciences at the University of Nottingham, listed acoustic therapy as one of several interventions. However, in December, a review of studies found no evidence of using sound versus placebo for tinnitus.
"Well, the absence of evidence doesn't mean absence of benefit," Baguley said. He also noted that some patients choose calming nature or ocean sounds as opposed to white noise, which could overlap with the suggested benefits of sound baths.
"It's more than just a distracting noise," Baguley said. "We know that sound has a massive influence on how the brain is organized."

Fears of Chinese military intervention in Hong Kong prompt warnings from US

Texto completo: ‘THE WORLD IS WATCHING’: With 10 weeks of protests growing more effective — and violent — in Hong Kong, and amid reports that China’s People’s Armed Police are assembled in the nearby city Shenzhen for “exercises,” U.S. officials are calling for restraint on both sides.
“Increasingly violent demonstrations have plunged the Chinese-ruled territory into its most serious crisis in decades, heightening fears of a hardline crackdown and sparking demands that the U.S. do more to guard Hong Kong’s special status,” writes Rob Crilly in the Washington Examiner.
“The people of Hong Kong are bravely standing up to the Chinese Communist Party as Beijing tries to encroach on their autonomy and freedom,” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tweeted. “Any violent crackdown would be completely unacceptable,” he wrote, linking to remarks he made last month on the Senate floor. “The world is watching.”
PROTESTERS OR TERRORISTS?: China is accusing Hong Kong demonstrators of engaging in "terrorism" and is threatening to stamp out protests mercilessly.
“Such violent crimes must be dealt with resolutely and in accordance with the law, without mercy,” Yang Guang, spokesman for China’s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said Monday in remarks translated by state-run media.
“Yang’s warning, the third in a series of unprecedented public comments by Beijing’s Hong Kong office, put a spotlight on protesters who reportedly threw petrol bombs at police, although state media acknowledged these incidents involved ‘a very small number’ of people,” writes the Washington Examiner’s Joel Gehrke.
HONG KONG’S AIRPORT CRIPPLED: Today thousands of protesters are occupying the departure area of the main terminal of Hong Kong’s airport — one of the world’s busiest — for a fifth consecutive day. The sit-in forced the cancellation of more than 100 flights yesterday.
Hong Kong is in a state of “panic and chaos,” said Chief Executive Carrie Lam at a news conference at the fortified government headquarters. “Take a minute to look at our city, our home,” she told reporters. “Can we bear to push it into the abyss and see it smashed to pieces?” she said, her voice wavering, according to Reuters.
MEANWHILE IN MOSCOW: In Russia’s capital, tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting election laws are being met with mass arrests and a violent crackdown by police. The protests were sparked by the exclusion of anti-regime candidates from next month’s Moscow city council election.
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty tweeted a video made by Lyubov Sobol, one of the opposition candidates barred from the upcoming municipal elections, showing armed, masked men barging into her office.
“It’s way beyond serious in Moscow, and the methods used by protestors - information - is increasingly effective,” tweeted retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling. “But this video is chilling.”
SKYFALL-OUT: Russia is denying there was any leak of radioactivity after an explosion killed five workers testing a new type of nuclear-propelled cruise missile.
The missile, which has been dubbed “Skyfall” by the West, is designed to use a small nuclear reactor to give it essentially unlimited range and the ability to evade U.S. missile defenses, which are largely designed to thwart a small number of ballistic missiles.
The accident has been described as a “mini-Chernobyl” by some U.S. analysts.
TRUMP’S CURIOUS TWEET: President Trump weighed on the mysterious explosion, boasting that U.S. weapons technology is far superior to the "failed" weapon.
"The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia," Trump tweeted. "We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian 'Skyfall' explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond. Not good!"
Trump’s tweet is curious because America does not have a nuclear-powered cruise missile nor any plans to develop one. Such a missile would emit radiation as it flew to its target, which the United States has said makes it impractical for use as a propulsion system for any kind of aircraft or missile.

HAPPENING TODAY: The top U.S. negotiator working to end the nearly 18-year war in Afghanistan is coming home empty-handed but still expressing optimism that a peace deal with the Taliban is at hand.
“We've concluded this round of talks that started Aug 3 between the US and the Taliban. Over the last few days, the two sides focused on technical details. They were productive,” tweeted special representative Zalmay Khalilzad yesterday. “I am on my way back to DC to consult on next steps.”
SORRY STATE OF THE AFGHAN FORCES: The latest report by the Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, found for the fourth reporting period in a row the number of Afghan security forces has decreased and is now at the lowest level since the NATO-led Resolute Support mission began in January 2015.
There are 79,535 personnel in the Afghan forces, 77.4% short of its authorized strength, a nearly 10 percentage-point decline from last quarter.
And now the New York Times has done its own analysis, which concludes “the country’s security forces are in their worst state in years — almost completely on the defensive in much of the country.”
“An analysis of more than 2,300 combat deaths of government forces, compiled in daily casualty reports by The New York Times from January through July, found that more than 87 percent occurred during Taliban attacks on bases, checkpoints or command centers,” the Times reports. “These numbers indicate that the Taliban can attack many such bases almost at will.”
GRAHAM’S CONCERN: Sen. Lindsey Graham, who spent time with President Trump over the weekend, says he warned the president not to repeat the mistakes of President Barack Obama in being too anxious to pull all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan.
“Here's what I would ask him to do: Take good, sound military advice, unlike President Obama, who ignored sound military advice,” Graham said on Fox News Channel yesterday, “We can end this war, Mr. President. You're right to want to end it. But you'll never get al Qaeda and ISIS at the peace table. They don't want peace.”
Graham said he had advised Trump to make sure that any deal with the Taliban includes a provision for U.S. troops to stay and fight terrorists.
“If we leave Afghanistan without a counterterrorism force, without intelligence-gathering capability, ISIS will reemerge, al Qaeda will come back. They will occupy safe havens in Afghanistan. They will hit the homeland. They will come after us, all over the world,” he said. “There will be no good deal to end the war in Afghanistan if you don't deal with ISIS and al Qaeda.”
THERE’S NOTHING LIKE DRIVING A STICK: The Navy will begin replacing the digital throttles on its destroyers with physical ones next year after a report found confusion and poor training on the touchscreen system contributed to a deadly crash, reports Russ Read in the Washington Examiner.
The National Transportation Safety Board released a damning report last week on the 2017 collision of the USS John S. McCain and the Liberian-flagged Alnic MC tanker, concluding "the root cause was the Navy's lack of oversight," which led to "insufficient training and inadequate bridge operating procedures."
NOT YOUR FATHER’S HUMVEE: The Marine Corps has announced its Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program has achieved initial operational capability.
The JLTV will replace the venerable High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, or HUMVEE, fleet.
“The warfighting capabilities the JLTV provides our Marines far exceed the capabilities offered by its predecessor,” said John Garner, a program executive officer, in a Marine Corps release.
BOARD GAMES: Last week, we learned that former defense secretary Jim Mattis has rejoined the board of General Dynamics, a position he held from 2013 to 2016, when he resigned to take the top job at the Pentagon. He was welcomed back by CEO Phebe Novakovic, who called him “a thoughtful, deliberate and principled leader with a proven track record of selfless service to our nation.”
Yesterday, the Center for Strategic and International Studies announced that Novakovic had joined its board of trustees, and CSIS president and CEO John Hamre cited her “exemplary leadership in both the national security and business sectors.”
Prior to joining General Dynamics, Novakovic served as special assistant to the secretary and deputy secretary of defense from 1997 to 2001. She also worked for the Office of Management and Budget and the Central Intelligence Agency.
FLASHBACK: You may recall we reported in June that in remarks to the Boston College Chief Executives Club, Novakovic said one of the top threats to America is the nation’s deepening political divide.
“As an American, I worry profoundly about our divisiveness as a nation,” she told the group. “Democracy requires shared values, and I don’t see that we have — we’re not having a national narrative about our shared values. There’s too much anger and hatred.”
“I worry a lot about the corrosive and cancerous effects of all that anger and hatred, sometimes flat out hatred, and that I think is scary,” she continued. “You can destroy yourself much faster than an enemy can. Typically great empires fall from the inside out.”

Word of the Week: 'Journalism'

Texto completo: What does journalism mean to you? More precisely, what does "journalism" mean to you, as a word?
Probably it has more to do with abstract ideas about civics and movies about Watergate than about “journals” in any literal way. If you look into the history of how people talk about the trade, there’s a lot of jargon to parse and a rash of clichés that are supposed to define what the thing is.
Good journalists take the world seriously and themselves unseriously, and the not-so-good journalists do the reverse and encourage readers to do the same. These two faces of the popular understanding of journalism are recorded in how we talk about it and teach it. There are ready-baked clichés one learns as a young journalist to explain the responsibility of the press. There’s the idea of ”speaking truth to power," of course. And the chiasmus, "comforting the afflicted, and afflicting the comfortable." The Atlantic promises to be "of no party or clique." The Washington Post changed its motto after 2016 to the incomprehensibly self-aggrandizing and emo "Democracy Dies in Darkness,” as though without that paper, the entire idea of majoritarian self-government falls apart.
But nothing holds a candle to the highfalutin' language surrounding the New York Times. There’s its Grey Lady nickname, its "paper of record" status, and its absurd claim to feature "all the news that's fit to print." As if all of this sloganing were not enough to imbue the idea of journalism with self-regard, we have also jettisoned that venerable chestnut of editorial advice, “Don’t make yourself the story.” Time’s person of the year was “The Guardians" — aka journalists under threat worldwide.
All of this contributed to a climate in which the supposed media-friendly side of the political aisle pitched a fit about a New York Times headline, released online before its next-morning print run, reading “Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism.” Even if you don’t believe Trump was being genuine in his speech, it’s not a literally inaccurate headline. But what happened next bespeaks a change in what “journalism” means to many Times readers. The comfortable, in their online masses, rose up and afflicted the Times with such a clamor of complaints that the “paper of record,” well, changed the record. Twice. They updated their own headline that had passed through editorial scrutiny.
If journalism means anything, it means an editorial process that will sometimes result in telling people things they don’t want to hear, and it means speaking to the readers rather than merely pandering to them. But a certain type of Times reader sees the paper as belonging to them, rather than informing them. For them, encountering disagreeable things in that paper is less like hearing someone say something you disagree with and more like hearing your church flipped its position on a core theological issue. It's no coincidence that, upon being elevated to Times executive editor, Jill Abramson in 2011 remarked, "In my house growing up, The Times substituted for religion. If the Times said it, it was the absolute truth." Some people want a paper of record. Others need to hear their own opinions parroted back in print so badly that what they crave is a paper of broken record. It's bad religion, and it's no journalism at all.

Texto completo: Miembros de las fuerzas militares venezolanas estarían siendo reprimidos por órdenes de Nicolás Maduro.
De acuerdo con el NEw York Times, el régimen de Maduro ha usado el aparato represivo del Estado contra sus propias fuerzas de seguridad para mantener el control sobre estas. La reciente muerte del capitán Rafael Acosta Arévalo es uno de los ejemplos.
“El abuso contra los oficiales ha crecido porque representan una amenaza real para el Gobierno de Maduro”, indicó el general Manuel Cristopher Figuera , exdirector de Inteligencia de Venezuela, quien desertó en abril y vive en EEUU, en un artículo publicado este martes por el New York Times.
Indica además el rotativo que de acuerdo con denuncias de varias organizaciones, como la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos y la Democracia , que señala que hay 117 oficiales, entre activos y retirados, detenidos en cárceles venezolanas.
El artículo subraya el caso de Acosta Arévalo, que murió a finales de junio bajo custodia del Estado venezolano por su supuesta implicación en una conspiración para dar un golpe de Estado , lo que fue condenado por EEUU.
Trump congela dinero y bienes del gobierno de Venezuela en EEUU, incluyendo PDVSA
El Gobierno de EEUU culpó al presidente Maduro y sus “asesores cubanos” por la muerte, a la vez que reiteró el apoyo al pueblo venezolano, según un mensaje publicado el pasado 1 de julio por la secretaria adjunta de Estado de EEUU para Latinoamérica , Kimberly Breier, en su cuenta de Twitter.
El Times recuerda que el militar fue sepultado el 10 de julio, en contra de los deseos de su esposa y rodeado de guardias de seguridad en una operación controlada por el Gobierno.
También de que los cinco familiares a los que se les permitió asistir no pudieron verlo porque su cuerpo estaba envuelto en un plástico marrón.
De acuerdo con el rotativo neoyorquino, algunas secciones del informe de su autopsia, que fueron filtradas, señalan que Acosta sufrió un traumatismo por fuerza contundente y electrocución , y que las autoridades han admitido el uso de fuerza excesiva en su caso.
El Gobierno venezolano detuvo a dos militares en relación con su muerte y señaló que los oficiales usaron fueron excesiva cuando el capitán se resistió al arresto, recuerda el Times.
Igualmente cita en el artículo los casos de otros militares que fueron torturados como el de Juan Carlos Caguaripano, un capitán de la Guardia Nacional que en 2017 dirigió un asalto fallido en una base militar, quien sufrió lesiones en los testículos debido a los golpes que recibió en la cárcel.
El preso más conocido de Venezuela y un plan de fuga planeado al milímetro
El artículo asegura que en los últimos dos años, a medida que se agrava la escasez de alimentos por el derrumbe de la economía petrolera, las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado han llevado a cabo por lo menos cinco operaciones para derrocar o asesinar a Maduro.
El Gobierno asegura que ha frustrado al menos una docena más de complots, incluido el plan con el que se vinculó a Acosta y otros cinco detenidos, lo que el Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV) , la organización política de Maduro, utiliza para justificar la vigilancia constante, detenciones arbitrarias y las torturas a los que considera sus enemigos.
Entre los vigilados, los 160.000 soldados que conforman las Fuerzas Armadas de Venezuela, señala además al Times al citar denuncias de Naciones Unidas.
Destaca también que la Coalición por los Derechos Humanos, con sede en Caracas y que representa a varios de los militares arrestados, ha documentado 250 casos de tortura cometidos por las fuerzas de seguridad venezolanas contra oficiales militares, sus familiares y activistas de la oposición desde el 2017.
Estos abusos fueron dados a conocer el pasado mes en un informe publicado por Michelle Bachelet, alta comisionada para los Derechos Humanos de la ONU.
Asimismo, el artículo apunta que aunque Maduro ha tratado de garantizar la lealtad de los altos mandos militares con promociones y contratos lucrativos, los oficiales de rango medio y bajo y sus familias se ven cada vez más afectados por la crisis.
“El hambre llegó a los cuarteles y se infectaron con disidencia”, dijo al diario Ana Leonor Acosta , abogada de la Coalición, quien asegura también que las Fuerzas Armadas están llenas de paranoia, desconfianza y división.

Texto completo: A profanity-laced viral video showing CNN anchor Chris Cuomo erupting in anger after being called "Fredo" by a heckler has gained national attention and prompted widespread debate about the term, which he described as a slur toward Italian-Americans.
In the video, Cuomo stated that he's been taunted as "Fredo" before, likening it to other slurs hurled at other racial and ethnic groups. As the altercation gained national attention, President Donald Trump repeated the term as an insult directed at Cuomo.
CNN spokesman Matt Dornic came out in defense of Cuomo in what he called an "orchestrated setup," using the term "ethnic slur" to describe "Fredo," which traces its origins to a character in "The Godfather" trilogy.
"Punk (expletive) from the right call me 'Fredo. ' My name is Chris Cuomo. I’m an anchor on CNN," Cuomo said in the viral video.
Cuomo has since responded to his initial comments, tweeting that this sort of harassment "happens all the time these days" in front of his family.
"But there is a lesson: no need to add to the ugliness; I should be better than what I oppose," he tweeted Tuesday.
What does 'Fredo' mean?
The term refers to the fictional Fredo Corleone — the second child of the Corleone clan in the "The Godfather" trilogy — and, as Cuomo puts it, the "weak brother. "
CNN response: CNN stands by anchor Chris Cuomo after NSFW exchange with heckler who called him 'Fredo'
The late Mario Cuomo, Chris' father, notably denounced the movie upon its release in 1972 for portraying stereotypes of Italian-Americans, boycotting it for years until 2013 — when he saw the film for the first time, according to the New York Times.
Fredo's depiction in "The Godfather Part II" is not flattering. He is portrayed as weaker and less intelligent than his siblings due to a bout of childhood pneumonia. He was also a family traitor, who worked with a rival to put a hit on Michael Corleone.
"Fredo was an untrusted and untrustworthy son who, after being patronized and 'passed over' by his powerful family, came to betray his brother out of stupidity and ego," said Prof. Michael Mark Cohen, an American studies professor at UC Berkeley, to USA TODAY. "So yes, that's a custom made, deep cut kind of insult for someone like Chris Cuomo. And evidently it cut to the quick. "
Fredo's demise in the film has become a cultural touchstone. As he recites the "Hail Mary" prayer, he is assassinated on a fishing boat at Lake Tahoe while Michael watches from a nearby lakehouse.
The scene was even alluded to by President Barack Obama at a speech he gave at the Lake Tahoe Summit in 2016.
"As I was flying over the lake, I was thinking about Fredo," Obama said, jokingly, eliciting laughter from the crowd. "It's tough. "
Political commentator Ana Navarro used the term to describe Donald Trump, Jr. — who is not Italian-American — on Cuomo's own program earlier this year.
'Fredo,' an ethnic slur? It's debated
Although Cuomo in the video says Fredo is an insult on par with other racial slurs, many have taken Cuomo to task for drawing that comparison.
Countless Twitter users, some of whom identified as Italian-American, repudiated the claim, saying it downplays the offensiveness of other racial slurs leveled toward people of color.
Donald Trump racial-slur allegations: Resurface in new book 'The Method to the Madness'
"It’s a MOVIE reference. Stop comparing it to the N-word," tweeted one user. "THIS invalidates when things are actually offensive to marginalized peoples. "
Cohen said that there's a legacy of ethnic slurs that can be hurled at Italian-Americans, dating back to the early 20th century — after Italians migrated en masse to the United States at the turn of the century. But none of them have the same "power to insult" as as slurs used toward people of color, especially black people, he said.
Representatives at The National Italian American Foundation and the racial justice organization Race Forward did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.
Some on social media noted that, given Cuomo's family history with the film, the targeted taunt may have a meaning to the CNN anchor that is not felt by an entire ethnic group.
Support for Cuomo from conservatives, liberals alike
While the term "Fredo" being compared to an ethnic slur has sparked controversy, support for Cuomo has come from conservative and liberal figures alike.
Conservative pundit and Fox News host Sean Hannity defended Cuomo's outburst.
"He's out with his 9 year old daughter, and his wife, and this guy is being a [expletive] in front of his family," Hannity tweeted yesterday. "Chris Cuomo has zero to apologize for. "
'I would say it again': North Carolina woman who used racial slur in viral video confrontation with black women
And Neera Tanden, the president of the liberal organization Center for American Progress, defended Cuomo's outrage.
"People who tell you it’s ok to call an Italian man Fredo are the same people who said it was ok to throw money at a woman leader and call her a (expletive)," she tweeted.

Texto completo: National Book Award-winning author Ta-Nehisi Coates and #MeToo reporter Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor will be among the featured speakers during autumn's Chicago Humanities Festival kick-off events, the fest announced early Tuesday morning.
They join previously announced speaker Rachel Maddow at the festival, which will grow to include scores of speakers and events across Chicago and Evanston mostly in late October and early November.
The festival Tuesday also announced a free, daylong Sept. 14 event called "Creative Chicago: Art and the City." The day of panel discussions at Venue Six10, 610 S. Michigan Ave., will result in a summary document being drafted for presentation to Mayor Lori Lightfoot and the city's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events.
Participants in this year's "Creative Chicago" program included Folded Map Project creator Tonika Johnson, DePaul Art Museum Director Julie Rodrigues Widholm and Field Foundation arts program officer Tempestt Hazel. One of the most distinguished writers on the contemporary African-American experience, Coates is the author of "Between the World and Me" and a noted essay on reparations, among other works. He'll speak at the UIC Forum on Oct. 2 at 7:30 p.m.
The talk will focus on Coates' debut novel "The Water Dancer" and "the importance of dealing with historical memory in contending with contemporary conversations around race," CHF says.
Twohey and Kantor are the Pultizer Prize-winning New York Times reporters whose work revealed decades of sexual manipulation by Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. They have continued to work in this vein, including pieces on well-connected child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and the sexual assault allegation by writer E. Jean Carrol against President Donald Trump.
Twohey is a native of Evanston and former Chicago Tribune reporter. Twohey and Kantor's book "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement" comes out Sept. 10. They'll speak at 7 p.m. Oct. 15 at First United Methodist Church in Chicago.
Tickets for the events go on sale to CHF members Aug. 20 and to the general public Aug. 27 ($50) at the festival site, chicagohumanities.org. That is also the place to RSVP for "Creative Chicago."

As U.S. Plans Pullout, Afghan Army Is on Defensive

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan -- As the United States appears to be nearing a deal with the Taliban on pulling its troops from Afghanistan, the country's security forces are in their worst state in years -- almost completely on the defensive in much of the country, according to local military commanders and civilian officials.
Afghan commanders vowed last year to take the offensive, rather than go on fighting a static "checkpoint war." But in most major battlegrounds, the bulk of the regular Afghan forces are still holed up in fortified bases and outposts. Most offensive operations have been left to small numbers of Afghan and American Special Operations soldiers, backed by both countries' air forces.
The woeful state of the regular Afghan forces has been widely seen as giving the Taliban a valuable edge in its negotiations with the United States, which have gone on for eight rounds in Doha, Qatar, and are believed to be near a conclusion. An announcement could come as early as Tuesday but also may be delayed, perhaps for weeks.
An analysis of more than 2,300 combat deaths of government forces, compiled in daily casualty reports by The New York Times from January through July, found that more than 87 percent occurred during Taliban attacks on bases, checkpoints or command centers. These numbers indicate that the Taliban can attack many such bases almost at will.
During that seven-month period, the Taliban mounted more than 280 such attacks -- an average of more than one a day.
"Police and soldiers are stuck in their bases," said Abdul Aziz Beg, head of the district council in Badghis Province in western Afghanistan. "The Taliban are killing security forces easily, but no one pays attention."
Local government officials in several provinces said the only ground operations against the Taliban were being carried out by the American-backed Afghan Special Forces.
"They come here, kill some people and arrest some, and that's it. When they leave, the Taliban come back" and kill regular troops in their bases, said Rahmatullah Qaisari, a district governor in Faryab Province in northern Afghanistan.
"To make people happy, security officials announce operations," said Tor Khan Zarifi, a tribal elder in Herat Province in the north. "These operations are kind of show-off -- they don't have any impact."
A senior American military official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, acknowledged that the Afghans were increasingly relying on elite units such as commandos and special police units to attack the Taliban. He said regular Afghan units still sustained most of their casualties while trying to hold on to territory anchored by bases and checkpoints.
Dan Coats, the American director of national intelligence, told Congress this year that outside urban areas, "Afghan security suffers from a large number of forces being tied down in defensive missions, mobility shortfalls and a lack of reliable forces to hold recaptured territory."
Afghanistan's minister of defense, Asadullah Khalid, said that since taking command in December he had worked to shift regular forces out of their defensive posture.
"Their mind-set has changed from defensive to offensive," Mr. Khalid said in an interview at the defense ministry in Kabul. "Let's be clear: These bases are not for us to just stay there and sleep there. They are going out on the offense."
But Mr. Khalid also said that some regular forces had sustained high casualty rates this year during Taliban attacks on checkpoints and bases, in areas where the militants were not threatened by government offensives.
"We are trying to reverse that situation," he said.
Only about three percent of the 2,300 deaths in the casualty reports compiled by the Times this year occurred during offensive combat operations carried out by regular forces. Among those were troops killed in Taliban ambushes after being sent to reinforce besieged bases or checkpoints.
Roughly 10 percent of the deaths occurred in other actions, away from bases and checkpoints. They were attributed to roadside bombs; attacks on convoys; snipers; insider attacks; friendly fire; and ambushes of soldiers or police who were on food runs, driving to work, in their homes, in bazaars, at weddings, in mosques or in clinics.
The casualty reports are compiled daily by Times reporters across Afghanistan. They are based on interviews with local government and security officials, district council members, village elders, local members of Parliament and other sources.
According to the Ministry of Defense's own combat reports, roughly seven times as many offensive operations have been carried out by commandos as by regular security forces. And the number of Afghan Air Force strikes has typically been far higher than the number of operations by regular forces.
For July, the ministry reported 2,825 operations by commandos and 651 airstrikes, compared with 409 operations by regular forces. Mr. Khalid said that in many operations, commandos were backed by regular forces.
The ministry said the July operations had killed more than 2,400 insurgents. As of Aug. 7, nearly 4,800 insurgents had been killed this year, said Gen. Khoshal Sadat, a defense ministry official. Both sides routinely inflate enemy casualty reports.
The ministry reports do not mention government casualties. After May 2017, the Afghan military stopped releasing its casualty figures. The information has since been treated as classified by the United States military at the Afghans' request.
By all accounts, Afghan security forces outnumber the insurgents. Yet the casualty numbers have been steadily rising among soldiers and police who were guarding bases and outposts, rather than engaged in actual battles.
On June 30, for instance, 58 members of the security forces were reported to have been killed in two separate Taliban attacks -- on a military base in the southern province of Kandahar, and on two checkpoints in Kunduz Province in the north.
Asked about those incidents, Mr. Khalid said the Taliban had suffered higher casualties than government forces, and that they had failed to capture the base or the checkpoints.
Three weeks later, on July 25, the Taliban briefly overran two military bases in Takhar Province in northern Afghanistan. Local officials said up to 37 troops were killed.
Increasingly, the only Afghan units truly on the offensive are Special Forces commandos, who often partner with American Special Operations troops for combined ground and air operations.
"The weight of the Afghan war is mostly on the shoulders of commandos and the air force -- they are doing all the offensive operations," said Gharzai Khowakhozhai, a former army general and a military analyst in Kabul, the capital. "Regular forces are not doing their job properly."
Mr. Khalid said he and the top American commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin S. Miller, agreed that Afghan forces had been maintaining too many remote outposts and checkpoints that were vulnerable to attack. But he said local politicians and some local commanders had resisted closing them down, because they protected the property of powerful local figures.
While the Taliban rarely hold the bases that they overrun for long, the casualties they inflict deepen the Afghan military's morale issues and recruitment problems. More than a third of the force has to be replaced every year.
In a report this month, the American inspector general for Afghanistan said Afghan military strength was at its lowest level since January 2015. Reported strength dropped by 42,000 troops from the same period a year ago, to just 77 percent of authorized strength.
The decline was attributed to a new pay system installed to combat so-called ghost soldiers: nonexistent troops included on payrolls by commanders who pocket their salaries.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: Disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein told a reporter last year he believed the criminalization of sex with teenage girls was a "cultural aberration," according to a newly released interview.

Epstein gave the interview to New York Times columnist James Stewart last August with the caveat that it would not be attributed to Epstein directly, but Stewart wrote today that “I consider that condition to have lapsed with his death.” The Bureau of Prisons said Saturday that Epstein was found “unresponsive in his cell” in the Special Housing Unit following “an apparent suicide."

Stewart wrote he met Epstein at his Manhattan mansion to ask him about rumors that Epstein was advising Tesla founder Elon Musk, and wrote that Epstein explained he had to be cryptic in his answers because “once it became public that he was advising the company, he’d have to stop doing so.”
"If he was reticent about Tesla, he was more at ease discussing his interest in young women,” Stewart remembered.
Stewart then wrote that Epstein “said that criminalizing sex with teenage girls was a cultural aberration and that at times in history it was perfectly acceptable.” Stewart also said that Epstein compared laws banning sex with underage girls to laws banning homosexuality, with Stewart writing that Epstein “pointed out that homosexuality had long been considered a crime and was still punishable by death in some parts of the world.”
Stewart also noted that the door to Epstein’s palatial Manhattan apartment was opened by a girl he thought may have been in her teens and that Epstein was displaying photos of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman as well as pictures of himself with film director Woody Allen and former President Bill Clinton.
“Displaying photos of celebrities who had been caught up in sex scandals of their own also struck me as odd,” Stewart wrote.
Stewart didn’t quote Epstein directly in the article except to say Epstein called himself “radioactive,” likely because of his prior sex offender conviction following a sweetheart deal with federal prosecutors in 2008.
Stewart also wrote that earlier this year Epstein “called to ask if I’d be interested in writing his biography” and that “he sounded almost plaintive,” with Stewart saying that “I sensed that what he really wanted was companionship.”
Epstein made this request after the explosive investigative articles by the Miami Herald catapulted the allegations swirling around Epstein back into the public eye, yet Stewart said he was “relieved I could say that I was already busy with another book” and turned down Epstein’s request, and the opportunity to learn more.

BLACK AND LATINO BABIES BORN PREMATURELY LESS LIKELY TO GET GOOD CARE: Black and Latino babies who are born at least 10 weeks premature are less likely to get the medical care they need and therefore more likely than white babies to die or have serious health problems, according to research published Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health and published in the journal Pediatrics, concluded that hospitals that are located in areas of the country with high minority populations should set up programs that focus on improving quality. Such programs tend to involve more training for staff and setting up very specific medical procedures to follow, including advice that providers pass on to patients.
Monday’s report adds to other troubling findings about racial disparities in pregnancy and childbirth in the U.S. Black women, for instance, face particularly dire outcomes in maternal mortality and disability, and are 50% more likely than white women to have a preterm birth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In the latest study, the researchers looked at data from 2006-2017, finding that disparities did narrow slightly over that time for both black and Latino babies, but that outcomes are still worse than for white babies. After about a dozen years of study, mothers of black babies were slightly more likely than at the start to get certain steroids that help their babies’ lungs function, and mortality fell slightly, as did hypothermia and sepsis.
But the findings also show that black babies still have the worst outcomes. The infants were less likely to get the care they needed and were more likely to die or to develop hypothermia; bleeding in the heart or brain; to have an infection in the intestine; or to have sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection.
The study used information from 224,297 infants taken from the Vermont Oxford Network, a voluntary global network that includes 789 Neonatal Intensive Care Units in the U.S.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL BLOCK IMMIGRANTS WHO RELY ON GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE LIKE FOOD STAMPS AND MEDICAID: The Trump administration in October will begin blocking the admittance of immigrants, as well as visa renewals, for people who have relied on or would be likely to rely on food stamps and/or Medicaid, along with other government benefits.
ADVOCATES FOR OBAMACARE PROTECTION CONTINUE BUS TOUR WITH ‘CARE FORCE ONE’: Protect our Care, a group dedicated to protecting the Affordable Care Act, is in its second week on the road to hold events supporting the validity of the healthcare law. “Care Force One” will stop in cities throughout the Midwest to hold press conferences featuring state representatives, U.S. House representatives, and late-stage cancer survivors to speak against the Texas lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.
PHYSICIAN ADVOCACY GROUPS CALLS FOR AN IMMEDIATE END TO CONGRESSIONAL RECESS TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE: Health professionals in Doctors for America, formerly called Doctors for Obama, say they are “horrified” and “exhausted” after recent mass shootings and the frequency of gun violence. The group is calling on Congress to come back to D.C. immediately to debate gun reform bills and bring them to a vote in the Senate, to greenlight funding into gun violence research, and to consider a “red flag” law that would temporarily take firearms from potentially violent people.
ELDERLY WASHINGTON COUPLE CITES MEDICAL COSTS IN MURDER-SUICIDE: Brian Jones, 77, killed himself and wife Patricia Whitney-Jones, 76, last Wednesday in their home. Notes were left in the couple’s home for Whatcom County law enforcement claiming the high costs of medical care for Patricia led Brian to kill them both.
SCALISE DOUBTS ‘RED FLAG LAWS’ WOULD BE EFFECTIVE: House Minority Whip Steve Scalise said Friday “red flag laws,” laws that would prevent potentially violent or disturbed Americans from buying guns, would not have prevented mass shooters from carrying out attacks. He said the laws would not have caught the person who shot him in 2017 at a congressional baseball game. Scalise said: "He just kind of went off the grid. And what are you gonna do about that? What law are you gonna pass that's gonna address that? In the end, all you end up doing is seeing more and more attempts to take away rights from law-abiding citizens.”
OREGON GOVERNOR SIGNS FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND PAID LEAVE LAW FOR LOWEST-EARNING WORKERS: Oregon Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, signed a law Friday to provide 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents, caregivers, and victims of domestic violence making the minimum wage. The law also applies to people working part-time or those who are in the country illegally, as long as they work 1,000 hours per year. The law offers 100% wage replacement for minimum wage workers and will begin paying benefits in 2023.

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEW YORK - Guards on Jeffrey Epstein's unit were working extreme overtime shifts to make up for staffing shortages the morning of his apparent suicide, a person familiar with the jail's operations told The Associated Press.
The person said that the Metropolitan Correctional Center's Special Housing Unit was staffed with one guard working a fifth straight day of overtime and another who was working mandatory overtime. The person wasn't authorized to discuss jail operations publicly and spoke Sunday on the condition of anonymity.
The jail staff failed to follow protocols leading up to Epstein's death, according to a report from The New York Times, deepening the fallout from what led to the highly connected financier's apparent suicide.
Epstein should have been checked on by guards in his cell every 30 minutes, but that didn't happen the night before his apparent suicide, a law enforcement official told the Times.
The official spoke to the Times on the condition of anonymity. The Associated Press has not independently confirmed the information.
A law enforcement source also told the Times Epstein was alone in his cell Saturday night after his cellmate was transferred. An official with knowledge of the investigation told the paper that the Justice Department was told Epstein would have a cellmate and be monitored by a guard every 30 minutes.
The mystery surrounding how he was able to kill himself in jail comes as investigators have been digging into allegations of sexual abuse and conspiracy against Epstein. An additional federal investigation was launched Saturday after the Federal Bureau of Prison said Epstein was found unresponsive in his cell at a high-security jail in Manhattan. He was later pronounced dead from an apparent suicide, the BOP said. His abrupt death cuts short a criminal prosecution that could have pulled back the curtain on the inner workings of the high-flying financier with connections to celebrities and presidents, though prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating.
Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found a little over two weeks ago with bruising on his neck, according to a person familiar with the matter who wasn't authorized to discuss it publicly. But he was taken off the watch at the end of July and therefore wasn't on it at the time of his death, the person said.
Attorney General William Barr, calling for an investigation by the FBI and the Justice Department's inspector general's office, said he was "appalled" to learn of Epstein's death while in federal custody. "Mr. Epstein's death raises serious questions that must be answered," Barr said in a statement.
Epstein, 66, had been denied bail and faced up to 45 years behind bars on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges unsealed last month. He had pleaded not guilty and was awaiting trial.
The federal investigation into the allegations remains ongoing, U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said. He noted in a statement Saturday that the indictment against Epstein includes a conspiracy charge, suggesting others could face charges in the case.
Epstein's death raises questions about how the Bureau of Prisons ensures the welfare of such high-profile inmates. In October, Boston gangster James "Whitey" Bulger was killed in a federal prison in West Virginia where had just been transferred.
Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote Saturday in a scathing letter to Barr that "heads must roll" after the incident.
"Every single person in the Justice Department - from your Main Justice headquarters staff all the way to the night-shift jailer - knew that this man was a suicide risk, and that his dark secrets couldn't be allowed to die with him," Sasse wrote.
Epstein's removal from suicide watch would have been approved by both the warden of the jail and the facility's chief psychologist, said Jack Donson, a former prison official who worked for the Bureau of Prisons for more than two decades.
On Friday, more than 2,000 pages of documents were released related to a since-settled lawsuit against Epstein's ex-girlfriend by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers. The records contain graphic allegations against Epstein, as well as the transcript of a 2016 deposition of Epstein in which he repeatedly refused to answer questions to avoid incriminating himself.
Giuffre, in an interview with The New York Times , said she's grateful Epstein will never harm anyone again, but is angry that there would be no chance to see him answer for his conduct.
"We've worked so hard to get here, and he stole that from us, too," she told the newspaper.
Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre's attorney, said Epstein's suicide less than 24 hours after the documents were unsealed "is no coincidence." McCawley urged authorities to continue their investigation, focusing on Epstein associates who she said "participated and facilitated Epstein's horrifying sex trafficking scheme."
Epstein's arrest drew national attention, particularly focusing on a deal that allowed Epstein to plead guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida and avoid more serious federal charges.
Federal prosecutors in New York reopened the probe after investigative reporting by The Miami Herald stirred outrage over that plea bargain.
His lawyers maintained that the new charges in New York were covered by the 2008 plea deal and that Epstein hadn't had any illicit contact with underage girls since serving his 13-month sentence in Florida.
Before his legal troubles, Epstein led a life of extraordinary luxury that drew powerful people into his orbit. He socialized with princes and presidents and lived on a 100-acre private Caribbean island and one of the biggest mansions in New York.

Cathay Pacific Meets The Iron Will of China

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Two months of boiling antigovernment protests have divided Hong Kong's people. Now, the unrest has pitted one of the territory's best-known international brands against some of its own employees.
The Chinese government has forced Cathay Pacific Airways, a longtime emblem of Hong Kong's proud status as a global capital, to bar staffers who support or participate in the territory's protests from doing any work involving flights to mainland China. As part of the same demands, issued on Friday, it ordered that the airline begin submitting information about all crew members flying to -- or above -- the mainland to the Chinese authorities for prior approval.
Cathay said separately on Saturday that it had removed from flying duties a pilot who was charged with rioting in Hong Kong, and that it had fired two airport ground staff for misconduct. Earlier in the week, the airline said it would investigate accusations that its employees had leaked travel information for a Hong Kong police soccer team.
The orders from mainland air safety officials represent an escalation into Hong Kong's business affairs, illustrating the power Beijing wields over international companies that build their fortunes on access to China. Some in the semiautonomous territory fear that China's political encroachment also represents an economic threat, not only to Cathay, but also to all multinational companies in Hong Kong.
"If you're a boss, you're thinking, 'Oh my God!"' said Carol Ng of the Hong Kong Cabin Crew Federation, a union that represents airline workers. "'I just want to do business here. Now they're screening my staff."'
This kind of fear could do real damage to Hong Kong's economy, Ms. Ng said, "much more than the protests or rallies themselves."
Cathay representatives did not respond on Sunday when asked how exactly the company planned to enforce the new orders from Beijing. China's aviation regulator was not available for comment.
The airline's largest shareholder is Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate with British roots. Its second largest owner is Air China, the state-run carrier. Cathay Pacific's shares were trading about 4 percent lower early Monday in Hong Kong.
Cathay's predicament underlines the economic pressures coming to bear on Hong Kong. Forecasters predict that the long-running protests on top of the trade war between the United States and China will weigh on the territory's growth. Tourist visits have declined, and the Hong Kong stock market has been falling for the past several weeks.
Several Cathay employees interviewed by The New York Times over the weekend said that the company had not asked workers about their involvement in or attitudes toward the demonstrations, something that it would presumably need to do to stop them from working on flights to mainland China.
Still, the employees described an atmosphere of rising fear and anger in response to China's demands, and of unease about how Cathay would carry them out.
"We are all so furious now," said Sally Chu, a 28-year-old Cathay flight attendant. "We wonder how they can check on our activities and ban us, too."
The airline, one of Asia's largest international carriers, has already blamed Hong Kong's recent turmoil for a drop in bookings. The controversy now threatens to test the company's commitments to its employees against its own bottom line, which depends significantly on its ability to fly through mainland Chinese airspace.
The pilot whom Cathay removed from service, Liu Chung-yin, was released on bail after his arrest late last month. But the Chinese state news media noted that he had been allowed to continue flying, and warned that Cathay would "pay a painful price" for "tacitly encouraging antigovernment strikes." Mr. Liu could not be reached for comment.
Other Cathay employees' political activities attracted attention in mainland China after large numbers of the airline's workers called in sick to take part in a recent general strike, which led to scores of flight cancellations.
Announcing the pilot's suspension on Saturday, Cathay went out of its way to say that "we express no view whatsoever on the subject matter of any proceedings to which he may be subject."
In a message to employees that day, Cathay's chief executive, Rupert Hogg, said the airline planned to comply with the Chinese regulator's new requirements. "Our primary focus must remain on delivering a safe, comfortable customer experience for everyone who chooses to fly with us," Mr. Hogg wrote.
Just days earlier, the airline's leaders had said employees' political views were not their concern.
"We certainly wouldn't dream of telling them what they have to think about something," Cathay's chairman, John Slosar, said at a news conference. "They're all adults. They're all service professionals. We respect them greatly."
It is also unclear whether meeting the Chinese authorities' demands will be enough to spare Cathay the wrath of Beijing's propaganda machine. In a social media commentary on Sunday evening, the People's Daily, the Communist Party's mouthpiece, said that the airline's actions had hardly resolved its "crisis."
"Ground the flights that must be grounded, punish those who must be punished, rectify what must be rectified," the commentary said. "In the face of such warnings, how can you joke around!"
Some Cathay workers said it might be for the best if they did not fly to the mainland after all, lest they risk being arrested or having their phones and other personal belongings searched.
"The airline must speak up and ensure the rights and personal safety of employees," said another Cathay flight attendant, Karrie Chan, 24. "Otherwise I would feel unsafe even when at work."
Cathay rose to pre-eminence by connecting Asia's emerging economies to London, Los Angeles, New York and other centers of wealth in the developed world. Hong Kong prospered by connecting China to the global companies that wanted to do business there.
Today, though, more of those companies operate in mainland China directly, with less need for Hong Kong as a bridge.
And Cathay is now just one of many carriers linking East and West. China's state-backed airlines can fly international passengers directly to and from the mainland's megacities. The flag carriers of the Persian Gulf nations offer their own convenient routes to Asia for travelers from Europe and North America.
Cathay Pacific's history is tied up with its home city's emergence as a global hub in ways that date back to the company's founding, in 1946.
The airline's founders, Roy Farrell and Sydney de Kantzow, were pilots who had flown missions across the Himalayas to supply Nationalist forces in China during World War II.
After the war ended, Mr. Farrell, a Texan, bought a surplus transport plane with the dream of flying goods to China from Australia, according to "Beyond Lion Rock," a history of Cathay by the journalist Gavin Young.
The Roy Farrell Export-Import Company's inaugural voyage from Sydney carried "three and a half tons of clothes -- for the tattered of China," The Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Hong Kong at the time was in near ruin. Its harbor was cluttered with the wrecks of warships from the Japanese occupation, and air services were almost nonexistent. But as the British colony grew rich over the following decades, so did Cathay, transforming from a swashbuckling shoestring operation into a carrier of regional, then international, renown.
That the airline was British-controlled and flown largely by British and Australian pilots did not prevent it from becoming a source of pride for many people in Hong Kong -- a respected global name associated with punctuality and good service.
The industry's changing landscape began taking a toll on Cathay's finances several years ago, and in 2017 the airline laid off hundreds of workers. It has since returned to profitability, although its image took another hit last year when it acknowledged that the personal data and travel histories of as many as 9.4 million people had been compromised in a computer breach.
Recently, Cathay bought Hong Kong Express, a low-cost airline, to help it better compete against budget upstarts in the region.
Cathay employees said over the weekend that they still trusted the company to treat its crew members fairly, and that concerns for their own jobs and safety were still outweighed by their desire to voice their convictions.
"The heavy-handed tactics of mainland China only make me feel that I must speak out so that they know how much we value freedom and democracy," said Ms. Chu, the flight attendant. "Otherwise, they will only get worse."

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE TERROR 9 p.m. on AMC. In the second season of this anthology series, the horror of Japanese-American internment camps in World War II is mixed with a ghost story influenced by the Japanese folkloric tradition of kaidan. Set mostly in an internment camp, the season stars the actor Derek Mio as Chester, an American-born California college student who is forced into the camp along with his family. The plot involves a series of mysterious deaths. Among the ensemble is an elder played by George Takei, the "Star Trek" actor who as a child was among the roughly 120,000 West Coast Japanese-Americans who were forced into camps as a result of racist anti-espionage measures enacted after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. "This project is groundbreaking in that the story of the internment of Japanese-Americans is being told on this scale, this scope, for the first time" on TV, Takei recently told The New York Times. "It's massive, 10 hours, 10 episodes and in such depth -- the characters are examined in depth."
OUR BOYS 9 p.m. on HBO. The 2014 killing of the Palestinian teenager Muhammad Abu Khdeir, in the wake of the kidnapping and killing of three Israeli teenagers, set off a conflict in Gaza that resulted in many more deaths and hardships. This 10-part series dramatizes the investigation into Khdeir's murder, and explores how a pair of grim events snowballed.
FAMILY PICTURES USA 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). The documentary filmmaker Thomas Allen Harris has long been interested in the way photographs have shaped historical narratives in America. His 2014 feature, "Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People," explored the ways in which photographs have been used by African Americans for centuries as tools of representation. In this new three-part series, Harris visits communities in North Carolina, Detroit and Florida, using interviews with locals paired with pictures of their ancestors to show the ways history shapes place -- and how a family photo album can unearth little-known local histories. ("Once you see America through family pictures," he says, "you'll never see this country the same way again.") The first episode, which focuses on North Carolina, includes histories tied to tobacco farmers; a cigarette roller; and businesspeople in the Durham, N.C., area known as Black Wall Street, where African-American entrepreneurs thrived around the beginning of the 20th century.
What's Streaming
GLOW Stream on Netflix. In a recent interview with The Times, the actress Betty Gilpin described the set of this wrestling comedy as being "like a feminist Montessori biodome experiment." Gilpin plays Debbie, one of several spandex-clad members of a made-for-TV 1980s women's wrestling league. Other cast members include Alison Brie as a fellow wrestler and Marc Maron as a TV producer. The third season relocates from Hollywood to the Las Vegas Strip.

Texto completo: HONG KONG - Thousands of black-clad anti-government protesters demonstrated at Hong Kong's international airport Friday, taking aim at both a global transit hub and the city's closely guarded reputation for order and efficiency.
The protest in the airport's arrivals hall, which is planned to last through Sunday, came as Hong Kong reeled from its worst political crisis since Britain handed the former colony back to China in 1997, and less than a week after protests and a general strike caused chaos in the city and led to 148 arrests.
The airport protest began in the early afternoon, as demonstrators in black T-shirts and face masks nearly filled the cavernous arrivals hall, chanting "Hong Kongers, keep going," a rallying cry for the 2-month-old protest movement.
"You've arrived in a broken, torn-apart city, not the one you have once pictured," read a pamphlet that protesters offered to arriving travelers. "Yet for this Hong Kong, we fight. We shall never surrender."
As of Friday night, the demonstration remained peaceful, and there had been no reports of arrests or disruptions of flights. Protesters were careful to leave a path clear for travelers, some of whom recorded the demonstration on their phones or helped themselves to pamphlets.
The protests in Hong Kong began two months ago, in opposition to a bill - now suspended - that would allow extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party. It has since expanded to include a number of other demands for greater democracy.
In recent days, mainland Chinese officials have issued stern warnings to protesters about the risks of continuing their campaign. On Friday night, the Chinese government struck at Hong Kong's flagship carrier, Cathay Pacific, some of whose employees were reported to have supported the protests.
China's civil aviation authority demanded that the airline bar staffers who have supported illegal assemblies or acts of violence from working on flights to mainland China. A Cathay pilot was reported to have been among dozens of people charged with rioting in connection with a recent protest, and more than 1,500 of its employees called in sick as part of the general strike Monday, according to a union representative.
Before the demonstration, several protesters, including employees of Cathay Pacific, stressed it was meant to be an entirely nonviolent way of maintaining the movement's momentum.
Miki Ip, a real estate agent who attended the demonstration, said she came partly to refute unproven claims by the Chinese government that the civil disobedience had been led by foreign forces who wanted to undermine Beijing's authority.
"China has told us so many lies, and we lack a government that really works in our interests," Ip, 38, said in the arrivals hall. "The living conditions facing youngsters nowadays are harsh, and they feel a lack of ownership over their hometown, both economically and politically."
Last week, news media controlled by the Chinese Communist Party accused a diplomat at the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong, Julie Eadeh, of being behind the protests. A State Department spokeswoman, Morgan Ortagus, suggested that China had leaked personal information about Eadeh, calling that the act of a "thuggish regime."
On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong responded by accusing the United States of "venomous and unfounded allegations" and "gangster logic."
The stakes are high for the airport protesters, in part because they have not applied for permission to hold the demonstration. That technically makes it an illegal assembly.
The Hong Kong airport handled nearly 75 million passengers last year, making it the world's eighth busiest for passengers, according to Airports Council International. It was also the world's busiest aviation terminal for cargo.
Several other anti-government demonstrations are planned for this weekend around Hong Kong. They include a family-friendly rally in the central business district that the police approved in advance, and three planned marches elsewhere for which permit applications were rejected.

Better ways &#xa0;to honor victims

Texto completo: Somehow the weirdness of the American gun obsession was crystallized for us last week when 200 gun control supporters rallied at the Legislative Office Building in Concord to urge Gov. Chris Sununu to sign into law three bills that would, respectively, establish a three-day waiting period for firearm purchases; create a state background check system; and mandate gun-free school zones.
As the Concord Monitor reported, the protesters were soon joined by a small contingent of armed counterprotesters who clustered in the back of the room, to the visible discomfort of those endorsing the gun safety measures. State police eventually arrived to provide security. Post-rally, there were verbal clashes between the two sides, but at least no gunfire.
The armed cadre insisted that their presence was not meant to intimidate (a claim about which we are skeptical), but rather to make a statement. What statement? “I would like it to be so normal to carry guns that the question isn’t even asked,” said Caleb Dyer, a Libertarian former state representative who is armed wherever he goes. “I wish that people were not afraid that I was carrying a firearm. It’s like any other tool that I have in my car.”
The question arises why Dyer, if all he wanted to do was make a statement, didn’t just leave that particular tool in his car with the rest of them, given that there is no link we know of between possession of a firearm and ability to speak.
Or if he needed a tool at hand, he could have left his firearm locked in the car and brought in a screwdriver. God knows, there may have been a handful of loose screws in that room.
But beyond that, all gun owners (a group that includes a couple of members of this editorial board) must recognize that a gun is not just another tool in the tool box. It is a potentially lethal weapon that must be treated with extreme caution every moment that it is not stored safely away. There’s no place for casual carry, and normalizing the presence of guns in public venues does just that.
As for the three bills now on the governor’s desk, Sununu has not signaled whether he will sign them. But in the past, he has said he saw no need to change the state’s gun laws. Whether the killing of 31 people in separate mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton last weekend will soften his opposition is anybody’s guess. The extent of his response so far has been the customary “horrified-by-senseless-acts” statement and ordering flags flown at half-staff to honor the victims. We’re bound to say that if he wants to honor the victims, a much better tool is at hand — a pen, with which to sign all three of those sensible firearm restrictions into law.
On the subject of mass shootings, the extent to which they have become an everyday fact of American life was conveyed in a New York Times story describing the latest in must-have back-to-school gear: the bulletproof backpack. They are being made and marketed by a handful of companies and sell for between $100 and $200.
One student wearing such a backpack on campus this fall will be University of Connecticut sophomore J.T. Lewis, whose younger brother, Jesse, was slain in the 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary. When the backpack was given to him by his mother, he told the Times, they didn’t have to exchange a word. They both knew.
The spectacle of terrified parents grasping at straws to protect their children from gun violence at school is testimony to the failure of the political system to perform one of its most basic functions: keeping people safe. Or as Igor Volsky, director of the gun control advocacy group Guns Down America, put it: “The market is trying to solve ... a problem that our politicians have refused to solve.”

Texto completo: Since the 1990s, researchers in the social and natural sciences have used computer simulations to try to answer questions about our world: What causes war? Which political systems are the most stable? How will climate change affect global migration? The quality of these simulations is variable, since they are limited by how well modern computers can mimic the vast complexity of our world -- which is to say, not very well.
But what if computers one day were to become so powerful, and these simulations so sophisticated, that each simulated "person" in the computer code were as complicated an individual as you or me, to such a degree that these people believed they were actually alive? And what if this has already happened?
In 2003, the philosopher Nick Bostrom made an ingenious argument that we might be living in a computer simulation created by a more advanced civilization. He argued that if you believe that our civilization will one day run many sophisticated simulations concerning its ancestors, then you should believe that we're probably in an ancestor simulation right now. His reasoning? If people eventually develop simulation technology -- no matter how long that takes -- and if they're interested in creating simulations of their ancestors, then simulated people with experiences just like ours will vastly outnumber unsimulated people.
If most people are simulations, Professor Bostrom concluded, the odds are good that we ourselves are simulations. Our world would be just one simulation of many, perhaps part of a research project created to study the history of civilization. As the physicist (and Nobel laureate) George Smoot has explained, "If you are an anthropologist/historian and want to understand the rise and fall of civilizations, then you will need to make very many simulations involving millions to billions of people."
The theory that we are living in a computer simulation may sound bizarre, but it has found adherents. The technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has said that the odds that we are not simulated are "one in billions." Professor Smoot estimates that the ratio of simulated to real people might be as high as 10¹² to 1.
In recent years, scientists have become interested in testing the theory. In 2012, inspired by Professor Bostrom's work, physicists at the University of Washington proposed an empirical experiment of the simulation hypothesis. The details are complex, but the basic idea is simple: Some of today's computer simulations of our cosmos produce distinctive anomalies -- for example, there are telltale glitches in the behavior of simulated cosmic rays. By taking a closer look at the cosmic rays in our universe, the physicists suggested, we might detect comparable anomalies, providing evidence that we live in a simulation.
Similar experiments were proposed in 2017 and 2018. Professor Smoot captured the promise of these proposals when he declared, "You are a simulation and physics can prove it."
So far, none of these experiments has been conducted, and I hope they never will be. Indeed, I am writing to warn that conducting these experiments could be a catastrophically bad idea -- one that could cause the annihilation of our universe.
Think of it this way. If a researcher wants to test the efficacy of a new drug, it is vitally important that the patients not know whether they're receiving the drug or a placebo. If the patients manage to learn who is receiving what, the trial is pointless and has to be canceled.
In much the same way, as I argue in a forthcoming paper in the journal Erkenntnis, if our universe has been created by an advanced civilization for research purposes, then it is reasonable to assume that it is crucial to the researchers that we don't find out that we're in a simulation. If we were to prove that we live inside a simulation, this could cause our creators to terminate the simulation -- to destroy our world.
Of course, the proposed experiments may not detect anything that suggests we live in a computer simulation. In that case, the results will prove nothing. This is my point: The results of the proposed experiments will be interesting only when they are dangerous. While there would be considerable value in learning that we live in a computer simulation, the cost involved -- incurring the risk of terminating our universe -- would be many times greater.
Consider the following hypothetical proposal for an experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest particle accelerator: "This experiment is unlikely to succeed in producing an interesting result, but if it does succeed in producing an interesting result, it may cause the annihilation of our universe." Would conducting this experiment be justified? Of course not.
As far as I am aware, no physicist proposing simulation experiments has considered the potential hazards of this work. This is surprising, not least because Professor Bostrom himself explicitly identified "simulation shutdown" as a possible cause of the extinction of all human life.
This area of academic research is rife with speculation and uncertainty, but one thing is for sure: If scientists do go ahead with these simulation experiments, the results will be either extremely uninteresting or spectacularly dangerous. Is it really worth the risk?

Texto completo: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' position in Democratic primary polls has slipped since early in the year, both in Pennsylvania and nationally, but one bedrock of his campaign remains very strong: his fundraising ability. August filings to the Federal Election Commission show that Mr. Sanders, as he did in the 2016 primary, continues to have an extremely large donor pool, outraising other Democrats by a significant margin.
An analysis by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, using data compiled by the Center for Public Integrity, shows the same is true in the Pittsburgh area. In the seven-county area, Mr. Sanders has an overwhelming lead, receiving $200,762 from 4,965 unique donors.
Airen Lowenstein, a University of Pittsburgh student who has given to Mr. Sanders 22 times in small increments, said that for her, "It's always been Bernie."
"He's always been fighting for us. The record will show that. He talks to us, even my generation," Ms. Lowenstein, 23, said. In addition to her regular donations, Ms. Lowenstein attended a rally Mr. Sanders held at Pitt in April, one of just two front-runner visits to the area so far this campaign. She likes his proposals to cancel student debt and create a single-payer health care system, she said.
The next best fundraiser, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, raised $129,495 from 2,877 donors. Ms. Warren's growing poll numbers are reflected in the donations: her best month of the six was June, when she received over double the donations of her second-best.
Damon Bethea, who directs a mentor program for the United Way, gave to Ms. Warren 53 times, totaling $1,202, starting in January. "A lot of her proposals and thoughts around [corruption in Washington] really resonated. It's time to think about how to transform Washington," Mr. Bethea said.
South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg came in third, with $122,181 from 2,563 donors.
Amy DePalma, an Edgewood web developer, said she was a supporter of Mr. Sanders in 2016 and gave to other candidates earlier this year, but she likes Mr. Buttigieg's proposals for "democratic reform." She gave to him 39 times in the first half of 2019, more than anyone else in the area.
"We can't do anything without reforming the Supreme Court and the electoral college. We can't do Medicare for All," Ms. DePalma said, referring to Mr. Sanders' health care plan that would guarantee insurance for all Americans. Mr. Buttigieg has said he supports eliminating the electoral college and adding more seats to the Supreme Court.
This analysis uses data accounting for over 90% of all donations to Democratic presidential candidates in the first half of 2019, including both itemized contributions from the campaigns and all contributions made through the fundraising platform ActBlue, which filed its own disclosure. The exception is contributions not made through ActBlue which add up to less $200 per contributor, such as small donations made at events or through the mail, or purchases of merchandise.
No centralized platform like ActBlue is in regular use by Republican campaigns, so data is available for a much smaller segment of donations to President Donald Trump (and his lone major challenger, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld), making comparisons impossible. Mr. Trump's national totals are larger even than Mr. Sanders', and his itemized contributions include substantial amounts from the Pittsburgh area, but less than 40% are itemized.
According to Terry Madonna, director of Franklin and Marshall College poll, fundraising numbers do not correlate directly with votes, as people who donate are a small subset of voters - but they're still very important, for obvious reasons.
"Money is a critical component," Mr. Madonna said. "If you don't have the money, you can't put together an organization, and you can't do the media promotion that you need to do."
For the most part, Pittsburgh fundraising by Democrats matches national numbers reported by the New York Times, with Mr. Sanders holding a major lead over Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg in both donors and dollars.
There are exceptions: Former Vice President Joe Biden did significantly better in southwest Pennsylvania, and California Sen. Kamala Harris did worse. Nationally, Ms. Harris had the fourth-most donors, followed by Mr. Biden, while their positions are reversed here. Mr. Biden was born in Scranton and launched his campaign in Pittsburgh in April. Mr. Biden also has the only endorsement from a sitting statewide Pennsylvania politician: Sen. Bob Casey endorsed the former vice president in April.
The polling front-runner, Mr. Biden raised $120,727 from 2,085 donors.
Rosemary Rinella, a dean's assistant at the University of Pittsburgh, said she likes Mr. Biden because he "did a marvelous job as vice president" and "has great integrity." She gave 24 times to Mr. Biden in the first half of 2019.
"'Obamacare,' he could build on that. 'Obamacare' was wonderful," she said, referring to the Affordable Care Act health care overhaul signed into law during Mr. Biden's time as vice president.
Of the five leading candidates, Mr. Sanders had the smallest average amount donated per donor, $40.44. Mr. Biden had the largest, $57.90.
"Would I rather have the money raised from small donors? Yeah, of course, but I don't think that's essential in the final analysis to win the campaign," Mr. Madonna said.
After Mr. Biden, there was a serious drop-off to Ms. Harris, who raised $65,563 from 1,490 donors.
Rachel Nicholson, of Avella, has given nine times to Ms. Harris. "I'm an attorney, that's why I'm attracted to her. She talks about saying she represents the people, and I remember the first time I stood up and said that, how I felt," Ms. Nicholson said.
Ms. Nicholson said she'd like to see younger Democratic leadership, and she appreciates that Ms. Harris, as a woman of color, "represents the fact that our country is not a white country."
Outside of the top tier, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke did unusually poorly locally, with fewer donors than entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is running on creating universal basic income for every American and had the sixth-largest donor base in the region. Nationwide, Mr. O'Rourke had over 50,000 more donors than Mr. Yang.
In dollar totals, Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan also performed unusually well with Pittsburghers, pulling in over $20,000, almost all from seven donors who gave the maximum allowed, $2,800. Mr. Ryan is relatively local - he represents Youngstown.

The Associated Press
Families of those killed when a gunman opened fire at an El Paso Walmart are gathering at funerals on each side of the U.S.-Mexico border to remember loved ones whose lives told the story of the vibrant region.
The 22 people killed ranged in age from 15 to 90, and included citizens of Mexico and the U.S. Many had deep ties in each country, with family on each side of the border and routines that included crossing the border to shop.
The funeral for 66-year-old Alexander Hoffmann Roth was held Friday afternoon in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, located just across the border from El Paso. Born in postwar Germany, he was serving in the German air force and stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso when he crossed the border into Ciudad Juarez and met the Mexican citizen who would become his wife at a dance club.
"It's an incredible binational place. I've had so many good memories in this area from Juarez and El Paso ... the people, the food, the music, the ambiance, everything, everything is so warm," said his daughter, Elise Hoffmann-Taus. "And this, this really hurts."
Her father, she said, mindful of what had happened in his native country, would often talk about the importance of studying history and warned about the danger of letting hate enter one's heart. He had crossed the border from his home in Ciudad Juarez on Aug. 3 to pick up groceries and medicine when he was killed.
She said that the long wait times to cross the border had made it harder as she tried to gather information about her father. The border waits have ballooned in recent months.
On Thursday in El Paso, a memorial service was held for 41-year-old Leonardo "Leo" Campos, who was killed along with his wife. Leo Campos grew up in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas but had in recent years moved to El Paso.
"He would always tell me stories about the scenic view and the culture. That it was really different up here," his brother, David Campos, who lives in San Juan, Texas, told the El Paso Times .
David Campos said he was heartened to know his brother had made so many friends in El Paso. Visiting the city for the first time for his brother's service, David Campos made an observation: "El Paso is just a united city; no matter what has happened, it's united."
The service for 15-year-old Javier Amir Rodriguez is set for today at an El Paso church. The teen, who was starting his sophomore year in high school, was at the Walmart with his uncle when he was killed. The avid soccer player was remembered as a fun-loving teen who was a good teammate during a vigil held Monday at the Horizon High School football stadium in El Paso.
The funeral was Friday in El Paso for 77-year-old Juan Velazquez. He and his wife, Nicholasa Velazquez, were shot Saturday after parking their car at the Walmart. She was injured and he died Monday.
Cruz Velazquez told The New York Times that his father, who was born in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, moved first to Ciudad Juarez and then to Denver, where he lived for 30 years. He eventually moved to El Paso because it was peaceful.
"He fought to get ahead in the United States," said Cruz Velazquez, who said his father had become a U.S. citizen.

Bodycams Distort Real Life

Texto completo: "You're going to kill me."
It's chilling to hear Tony Timpa's words on a Dallas police officer's bodycam recording because he was right.
A few minutes after Mr. Timpa, 32, pleaded with the police for his life, it was over and his corpse was loaded into the back of an ambulance.
The bodycam footage shows a lot. It shows us that Mr. Timpa asked for help more than 30 times. It shows that the officers joked about waking Mr. Timpa up for waffles and school. But still the picture is incomplete, because the recording gives only the point of view of the police officers.
As a matter of fundamental human psychology, we're primed to align ourselves with the actions of the subject. FMRI studies have found that our brain activates when we view first-person images in a way that it does not when viewed from the third person. Simply put: Showing the officer's perspective makes viewers defer to their narrative. When Miami-Dade County in Florida approved $ 5 million for bodycams in 2015, a dissenting commissioner noted that while sports calls can be debated, with police cameras, "it's one angle, it's one moment in time. There are issues there."'
Cameras that were sold to the public with the promise of increased accountability also end up reinforcing the police narrative. This dynamic is yet another example of a disturbing trend: Technological solutions to human problems often have alarming side effects that aren't fully understood until the technology is in wide use.
One of the most crucial concerns motivating the widespread adoption of bodycams was use of force by the police. In the aftermath of the 2014 deaths of Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and many others, there was a concerted effort to win over the public to bodycams with the promise of justice. When a St. Louis grand jury decided not to indict Michael Brown's killer, his family asked the country to join in a "campaign to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera."
But the shaky, low quality of bodycam footage often adds what critics call a "deceptive intensity," which can help justify police use of force.
One of the first major evaluations of bodycams, in 2014 by the Police Executive Research Forum, offered the tantalizing promise that "body-worn cameras are helping to prevent problems from arising in the first place by increasing officer professionalism, helping agencies evaluate and improve officer performance, and allowing agencies to identify and correct larger structural problems within the department." The next year, when Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced a $ 23 million bodycam pilot program, she echoed the promise of "transparency, accountability and credibility."
The reality has proved far more complicated.
Lax departmental policies give many officers discretion over when and what to record. Combine that with lopsided privacy protections, which are more focused on protecting officers than the general public, and bodycams begin to look less like a tool to keep cops in line and more like a tool to monitor civilians. We know about Mr. Timpa's excruciating final minutes only because of a three-year legal campaign by The Dallas Morning News to have the footage released. And that case is not an outlier.
The New York Police Department failed to release bodycam footage in 40 percent of cases where it was requested by the Civilian Complaint Review Board. Yet when the footage is favorable to the police, it is often released or privately leaked within a matter of hours. That double standard can warp the public's understanding of how and when the police use force.
These factors would be enough to chill the campaign for bodycam adoption, but the harms go much further. Often, the tools that are sold to the public as a mechanism to hold officers accountable are turned against the very communities they are supposed to empower.
[If you're online -- and, well, you are -- chances are someone is using your information. We'll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter .]
Each officer's bodycam captures information on hundreds or even thousands of individuals that an officer sees on a given day. These recordings can reveal a lot about innocent members of the public, but the privacy impact is only amplified when combined with the emerging focus on integrating facial recognition surveillance into existing bodycams.
Facial recognition integrated with bodycams would allow the police to turn a walk down the block into a warrantless search of where people go and with whom they associate. An officer standing outside an abortion clinic or political protest, for example, could chill some of our most fundamental constitutional rights.
Concerns about perspective and selective recording that apply to bodycams also apply to videos of police interrogation. Unsurprisingly, interrogation videos shot from the perspective of a suspect are much more effective in convincing viewers that a confession was coerced compared with videos shot from the perspective of the police interrogators. But unlike with police bodycams, which are attached to officers' uniforms, there's no technical excuse for recording only one perspective of a conversation. Yet, at a time when close to two dozen states lack any requirement to record custodial interrogations, few, if any, mandate that cameras show interrogations from a neutral perspective.
This trend is also evident in A.I.-driven forensic science. Commissioner James O'Neill of the New York Police Department wrote in The Times recently that facial recognition is a tool to protect defendants: "The software has also cleared suspects. ... When facial recognition technology is used as a limited and preliminary step in an investigation -- the way our department uses it -- these miscarriages of justice are less likely." Yet this description of facial recognition bears little resemblance to the realities of his department's practices.
In at least one documented case, this supposed bulwark against wrongful conviction led to the police texting a supposed photo match to a witness and asking, "Is this the guy?" This sort of leading question is exactly the type of contamination that can suggest a false identification to eyewitnesses, leading them to later misidentify a person in court. Again, a technology sold on the promise of accountability turned into a threat to privacy.
Each of these problems has its own solutions. For bodycams, that means new privacy safeguards and limits on officer discretion about when to record. For interrogations, it means filming them from a neutral angle and for the duration of questioning. And for facial recognition, it means a moratorium until questions about bias can be resolved.
It is wise to be wary of technical fixes to complicated problems. It's ever clearer that the surveillance solutions can be worse than the problem they seek to fix.

Nicolas Cage doesn’t want to be a meme

Texto completo: Despite becoming one of the most popular faces on the internet, Nicolas Cage says he’s not trying to be a meme.
He didn’t mean to become an internet phenomenon, and he’s not paying that much attention anyway. In a wide-ranging interview with the New York Times published Wednesday, Nic “I’m going to steal the Declaration of Independence” Cage says he tries to stay offline:
I’ve taken risks. But there has been a collision between the acting experiments and the memeification extrapolated from them. That has not been intentional. I have no social media presence. I’m not on Instagram. I am not on Facebook. I have no Twitter account. I genuinely am a private person who does not want his personal life exposed. I wanted to have the mystery of the old stars, always preserved in an enigmatic aura. It’s hard to do that now.
His persona as an actor, which somehow combines camp with oddly philosophical methodology, has made him one of the most internet-friendly celebrities, but he doesn’t feel the need to keep up.
Cage became the “You Don’t Say” meme at the dawn of the genre, and he’s since become a popular source for everything from pranks to home goods. (One user review of a pillow with Cage’s face on it, sold by Amazon, reads: “It may be the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon. Heck, it may be the best thing I've ever owned.”
Like Keanu Reeves, Cage has maintained his internet popularity by being both cinematically ubiquitous and, as millennials say, largely unproblematic. But Cage doesn’t need to see himself as the face that launched a thousand memes.
While social media users are sharing his face on Twitter, he’s probably at home sipping champagne; the internet can enjoy his persona, and he can enjoy his privacy. If there’s a healthy way to enjoy fame, it seems Cage has found it.

Texto completo: Faced with mounting debt and strapped for cash, many low-income college students across the country are skipping meals, buying cheap junk food, or devoting time that could be spent learning to searching for free food events, researchers say.
A national survey published this year by the Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice found that 48 percent of students in two-year institutions and 41 percent of students at four-year institutions experienced food insecurity within the past month.
The problem of food insecurity — an inconsistent supply of nutritious food — on college campuses has garnered more awareness in recent years, and psychologists have started to take note.
Researchers have found that food insecurity hinders students' well-being and academic performance — and it disproportionately affects low-income, first-generation, international, and other minority students.
Food insecurity is strongly correlated with mental health issues, said Yu-Wei Wang, research director at the University of Maryland Counseling Center and chairwoman of a symposium on food insecurity at this year's American Psychological Association convention.
“Students who we interviewed have told us that because of malnutrition, they got so depressed that they were hospitalized," Wang said Thursday. “Sometimes they are so hungry, they cannot focus on school."
FROM THE ARCHIVES: What is it like to be poor at an Ivy League school?
Hungry students were also more likely to fail assignments and exams, withdraw from classes or schools, and have lower grades, Wang said in a statement from the APA.
Wang and her colleagues surveyed about 5,000 students at the University of Maryland-College Park and found that nearly 20 percent worried about being able to buy nutritious food. Thirteen percent could not afford balanced meals and stretched their dollars by buying cheap food, while 7 percent decreased the size of meals or skipped them altogether because they had run out of money.
Other coping strategies, Wang said, included smoking or napping to distract from the feeling of hunger.
Wang said food-insecure students also are more likely to be anxious, angry, and lonely than their peers who are not worried about how they are going to eat. “Some students did not use resources they are eligible for because they felt embarrassed, ashamed or believed that other students were in greater need," Wang said.
University of California Santa Cruz psychology professor Heather Bullock and her colleagues, in a separate study presented at the symposium, also found that the stigma of food insecurity decreased students' sense of self-worth and deterred them from accessing programs and services.
After Wang and her colleagues shared their research at the University of Maryland, faculty, staff, and students ran food drives and food insecurity destigmatizing campaigns, and also established emergency meal funds.
Wang noted that the number of campus food pantries across the country has grown exponentially in the past decade. In the Boston area, Bunker Hill Community College, Berklee College of Music, and Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology are among the colleges that have campus pantries, according to the College & University Food Bank Alliance.
FROM THE ARCHIVES: Even at elite colleges, students go hungry
Harmony A. Reppond, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan and another panelist, called for systemic solutions.
“Pantries are addressing immediate needs. To sustain food security, campus food pantry directors cite the need to expand funding of existing policies at the state and federal levels, such as Pell Grants," Reppond said in the statement.
The US Government Accountability Office also published a report on food insecurity.  It found that, in 2016, nearly 2 million at-risk students who may have been eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program did not particpate. The report recommended making it easier for students to understand and access food benefits.
Last month, Senator Elizabeth Warren and US Representive Al Lawson introduced the College Hunger Act of 2019, which aims to allow more college students to apply for SNAP benefits, among other proposals.
Anthony A. Jack, a Harvard Graduate School of Education professor who has studied food insecurity, said he is encouraged to see scholars from other disciplines such as psychology study the issue, because it will shed more light on both the prevalence and nature of the problem.
Jack pointed out that food insecurity afflicts not only community colleges, but also elite schools.
For instance, when Harvard dining halls closed during spring break, low-income students struggled to buy meals and endured “structural inequalities that keep students in second-class positions at first-class institutions," Jack said.
“The fact of the matter is that undergraduate and graduate students, just like their elementary school peers, can be too hungry to learn," Jack added. “That's something that colleges must address."

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- Many explanations have been put forward to explain why Hong Kong, a city famous for its orderly ways, has been convulsed by nine weeks of increasingly violent protests.
The most immediate is fury at a proposed law that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. There is also anger at astronomical property prices fueled by wealthy buyers from mainland China, and revulsion at heavy-handed police tactics involving the regular use of tear gas and rubber bullets.
On Thursday, however, China's ruling Communist Party identified a novel reason for the unrest: the secret machinations of an American woman working as a diplomat in the United States Consulate in Hong Kong.
The woman, Julie Eadeh, a political counselor, has become a central figure in a growing Chinese narrative that Hong Kong's protests are the work of traitors who are being directed by foreign, particularly American, "black hands" bent on fomenting an uprising in the former British colony.
CCTV, China's state broadcaster, described Ms. Eadeh on Thursday as "the behind-the-scenes black hand creating chaos in Hong Kong."
Ta Kung Pao, a Hong Kong newspaper controlled by the Communist Party, published a photograph, taken on Tuesday, of the diplomat standing in the lobby of a luxury hotel with pro-democracy student leaders under the headline "Foreign Forces Intervene, Seek to Stir 'Color Revolution."' It said it had received the photo from unidentified patriotic "netizens."
The newspaper described Ms. Eadeh, a graduate in Arab studies from Georgetown University, as "a mysterious and low-profile expert on subversion."
The same newspaper, as well as other Hong Kong outlets, last month published a photograph of a non-Chinese man it described as a "foreign commander" of the Hong Kong protest movement. The image showed the man, who was said to be providing information about police movements to protesters, sitting on the steps of a pedestrian walkway with his cellphone. The man was in fact an editor at The New York Times, Kevin Roche, and he was communicating at the time with a Times reporter.
A State Department spokesman, asked about the accusations against Ms. Eadeh, said that American diplomats "meet regularly with a wide cross-section of people across Hong Kong" and that on the day of her encounter with student activists, "our diplomats also met with both pro-establishment and pan-democratic camp legislators, as well as members of the American business community and the consular corps."
The spokesman added, "We categorically reject the charge of foreign forces as being behind the protests. It is not credible to think that millions of people are being manipulated to stand for a free and open society."
The "black hand" allegations aired on Thursday against Ms. Eadeh mimic almost word for word Chinese propaganda 30 years ago against the leaders of the pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.
Few analysts expect the People's Liberation Army, which has a garrison in Hong Kong, to be called out to stage a repeat of the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing and quash the demonstrations. But the barrage of propaganda casting the protests as a foreign-inspired plot that threatens China's national security has sent an ominous warning that Beijing wants the Hong Kong government to take tougher action to contain the crisis.
On Wednesday, Beijing's top official for Hong Kong, Zhang Xiaoming, said that the protests had "the obvious characteristics of a color revolution," a reference to the popular uprising that started in the Caucasus nation of Georgia in 2003 with the so-called Rose Revolution and brought pro-Western governments to power in a number of former Soviet republics.
The accusations of foreign meddling are a sign that Beijing, already bitterly at odds with Washington over trade, has decided to add Hong Kong to its list of grievances against the United States.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry's office in Hong Kong issued a statement on Thursday saying that it would make "solemn representations" to the United States over its consulate official's "contacts with the 'Hong Kong independence movement."'
The ministry in Beijing first fingered the United States as a culprit in the Hong Kong unrest last month, asserting that unidentified American officials were behind an initial round of violent clashes.
But vague accusations of foreign meddling have now given way to a more detailed conspiracy theory featuring the supposedly "secret meeting" this week between Ms. Eadeh and the student activists.
Wen Wei Po, another Hong Kong paper controlled by the Communist Party, also published the photograph of Ms. Eadeh at the meeting, along with a picture that showed the diplomat, who earlier worked in Baghdad, wearing a flak jacket and helmet and surrounded by military hardware during a trip to the Iraqi city of Mosul.
The newspaper also published a list of American officials and politicians it accused of interfering in Hong Kong's affairs, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President Mike Pence and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.
The Global Times, a Beijing tabloid also controlled by the Communist Party, picked up the Hong Kong reports, describing Ms. Eadeh as "a so-called diplomat" who had previously worked in the Middle East "planning subversive activities on the grounds of human rights and democracy."
Joshua Wong, a pro-democracy student leader who appears in the hotel photograph, scoffed at the reports of a conspiracy in a post on Facebook: "They are saying this again. The protesters can handle things like press conferences, which dirty cops and the chief executive cannot, so there must have been secret training!"
The Standard, a Hong Kong newspaper, quoted him as saying he had met with Ms. Eadeh to urge the United States to stop exporting tear gas and rubber bullets to Hong Kong.
"What's so special about meeting a U.S. consul?" he said.
The belief that the State Department is coordinating and even orchestrating the Hong Kong protests feeds into a narrative that dates back to the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet Union each sought to subvert the other's ideology and its proxy states with spies and subterfuge.
Ideological rivalry has now subsided, with even China, though nominally still wedded to communism, showing no interest in exporting Marxism through subversion. But both Moscow and Beijing have in recent years sought to blame outsiders for domestic troubles -- notably when Russia alleged that Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Moscow from 2012 to 2014, was an instigator of street protests against Vladimir V. Putin, who was then the prime minister.
China has until now mostly avoided attacking American diplomats by name, leaving this to nationalist bloggers like those who accused Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former ambassador to Beijing, of trying to stoke a "Jasmine Revolution" in China in 2011 by appearing outside a McDonald's restaurant in Beijing on the day of a proposed protest that never took place.

Texto completo: SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook is pitching a new media initiative to license articles from some of the largest American news publishers and display that content inside the social network's mobile app, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions.
The project involves the social network striking deals potentially worth millions of dollars to publishers including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Dow Jones, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, among others, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.
The agreements would let Facebook pull in headlines and previews of the articles from partner publications for display inside a "News" tab in the Facebook app, they said. The talks with news organizations are continuing, they added, and it is unclear if any deals are close. Facebook hopes to introduce the effort by the end of the year.
Representatives for Dow Jones, The Times and The Post declined to comment. A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed that the company was aiming to include a "News" tab inside its app by the end of the year, but declined to comment further. News of the talks was first reported by The Journal.
Facebook's pitch is the latest move by a major tech platform into the digital news and entertainment space, as companies vie for people's attention. In a partnership with publishers, Google has developed Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, to load articles faster on smartphones. Snapchat has also locked in revenue-sharing deals with publishers on its "Discover" tab inside its app.
In the past, Facebook secured deals with publishers -- including The Times -- that sucked entire articles into its app for them to load faster and provide what the company called a "better user experience." But that project, called Instant Articles, fizzled shortly after its debut.
As Silicon Valley players have continued courting the news business, publishers have grown wary for fear of tech companies' luring audience loyalty away from publishers' sites.
Facebook is trying to differentiate its new product from past offerings. In its pitch, the company said its "News" tab would not display the main text of articles inside Facebook's app. Instead, it would link to publishers' sites or apps and direct users elsewhere to read whole articles, the people familiar with the plans said.
That has proved more enticing to some publishers than a deal proposed by Apple this year. The Apple News app, which costs subscribers $ 10 a month, pulls in entire articles from partner publishers, which include Vice Media and New York magazine. Apple takes half the overall revenue, while the publishers split the remaining 50 percent, paid to each outlet on a per-view basis.
Publishers including The Journal joined the Apple News effort. Others, like The Times and The Post, declined.
"We tend to be quite leery about the idea of almost habituating people to find our journalism somewhere else," Mark Thompson, chief executive of the New York Times Company, told Reuters in an interview this year. "We're also generically worried about our journalism being scrambled in a kind of Magimix with everyone else's journalism."

Texto completo: Trump tells reporters he’s likely to commute Blagojevich’s sentence President Donald Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Wednesday that he is likely to commute former Gov. Rod Blagojevich’s sentence.
Blagojevich has served about half of a 14-year federal prison sentence for corruption that included seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated to become president.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One as they flew back to Washington from El Paso, Texas, the president hinted he was open to giving Blagojevich, 62, a break, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
"In the last hour of the flight, POTUS came back to the press cabin for a 45-minute off-the-record conversation. He then said the press could put one part on the record — that he is again considering commuting the sentence of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich," the pool report said.
"I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly; he was given close to 18 years in prison. And a lot of people thought it was unfair, like a lot of other things — and it was the same gang, the Comey gang and all these sleazebags that did it. And his name is Rod Blagojevich," the president said, misstating Blagojevich’s sentence.
"He’s been in jail for seven years over a phone call where nothing happens — over a phone call which he shouldn’t have said what he said, but it was braggadocio you would say. I would think that there have been many politicians — I’m not one of them, by the way — that have said a lot worse over the telephone."
The New York Times’ Maggic Haberman tweeted that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, had pushed for a pardon, but aides instead persuaded Trump to agree to commutation.
In June 2018, Trump broached the possibility of freeing Blagojevich, suggesting the one-time "Celebrity Apprentice" contestant was convicted for "being stupid."
Wife Patti Blagojevich has waged a focused campaign — primarily in FOX News appearances and through social media — to appeal to Trump for clemency, the Sun-Times reported.
"His wife I think is fantastic, and I’m thinking about commuting his sentence very strongly. I think it’s enough, seven years," Trump said.
The pool report did not mention why Trump wanted to discuss Blagojevich.
Blagojevich is scheduled to be released on May 23, 2024. He currently is serving his sentence in an Englewood, Colorado, facility.
The CEO at the time of Edward Hospital in Naperville, Pam Davis, is credited with helping blow the whistle on Blagojevich. She wore a wire to record conversations with Blagojevich cronies trying to shake her organization down as the hospital tried for years to build a second hospital in Plainfield but was denied repeatedly from the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Board.

Texto completo: For over 15 years, Jeffrey Epstein served as a close personal adviser to Leslie H. Wexner, the billionaire mogul behind Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. Now, Mr. Wexner says Mr. Epstein "misappropriated vast sums of money" from him and his family.
Mr. Wexner, the chief executive of the retail giant L Brands, included the accusation in a 564-word letter he sent Wednesday to the Wexner Foundation, giving his most detailed account yet of how his life and affairs became intertwined with Mr. Epstein, who was arrested last month and charged with sex trafficking involving girls as young as 14.
In the letter, Mr. Wexner said the misappropriation was first discovered in 2007 as he separated from Mr. Epstein. In early 2006, Florida authorities charged Mr. Epstein with multiple counts of molestation and unlawful sexual activity with a minor. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor and was required to register as a sex offender.
"It was agreed that he should step back from the management of our personal finances," Mr. Wexner said in the letter. "In that process, we discovered that he had misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family. This was, frankly, a tremendous shock, even though it clearly pales in comparison to the unthinkable allegations against him now."
Mr. Epstein, 66, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he and his employees paid dozens of underage girls to engage in sex acts. A lawyer for Mr. Epstein did not respond to Mr. Wexner's new accusations. In a letter to L Brands employees last month, Mr. Wexner, 81, said he was "NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment."

Mr. Wexner used his letter on Wednesday, addressed to the "Wexner Foundation Community" and distributed to the press, to cast himself as an unwitting victim of his former adviser's financial impropriety, after weeks of questions about his deep ties to Mr. Epstein.
The New York Times reported last month that company executives in the mid-1990s had learned that Mr. Epstein was trying to pitch himself as a recruiter for Victoria's Secret models.
In the same article, The Times reported that Mr. Wexner had given Mr. Epstein wide powers over his finances, philanthropy and private life.
"I first met Mr. Epstein in the mid-1980s, through friends who vouched for and recommended him as a knowledgeable financial professional," Mr. Wexner wrote in the letter to the foundation. "Mr. Epstein represented that he had various well-known and respected individuals both as his financial clients and in his inner circle. Based on positive reports from several friends, and on my initial dealings with him, I believed I could trust him."
That trust included a so-called power of attorney, which enabled Mr. Epstein to hire people, sign checks, buy and sell properties, and borrow money -- all on Mr. Wexner's behalf.
Mr. Wexner defended his decision to give Mr. Epstein power of attorney, calling it "common in that context" and saying, "He had wide latitude to act on my behalf with respect to my personal finances."
Before the separation, Wexner-backed entities financed a charity called C.O.U.Q., which Mr. Epstein controlled. That foundation accepted an $ 11.2 million donation from the Wexner Children's Trust in 2002 and $ 10 million from the Leslie H. Wexner Charitable Fund in 2004.
In the letter sent Wednesday, Mr. Wexner said he had been "able to recover some of the funds" that he said were misappropriated by Mr. Epstein. That included a transfer of about $ 46 million worth of securities from C.O.U.Q. and a Virgin Island business controlled by Mr. Epstein to a foundation run by Mr. Wexner's wife, Abigail Wexner, according to tax documents.
Mr. Wexner pegged that sum as a "portion of the returned monies." "All of that money -- every dollar of it -- was originally Wexner family money," he added.
"I am embarrassed that, like so many others, I was deceived by Mr. Epstein," he wrote. "I know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced, and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path."
The relationship between the two men has posed a potentially grave problem for L Brands, a publicly traded company that has been trying to distance itself from the scandal involving Mr. Epstein.
The company has said it hired outside lawyers "to conduct a thorough review" into the relationship.
L Brands has struggled to find its footing as retailers move away from sexualized marketing in the era of #MeToo. This week, Mr. Wexner told employees that Ed Razek, its longtime chief marketing officer, was retiring. Mr. Razek was instrumental in developing eroticized campaigns for Victoria's Secret, as well as its annual fashion show.

Texto completo: From Pittsburgh to Christchurch, and now El Paso, white men accused of carrying out deadly mass shootings have cited the same paranoid fear: the extinction of the white race.
The threat of the "great replacement," or the idea that white people will be replaced by people of color, was cited directly in the four-page screed written by the man arrested in the killing of 22 people in El Paso over the weekend.
The phrase was coined in 2012 by the French author Renaud Camus, whose writing on white genocide echoes at least a century of white supremacist views. But some experts now fear the doctrine of replacement is being embraced more readily by lone wolf white terrorists and even some politicians, producing a particularly dangerous climate.
"These series of shootings all have an element of fear and anxiety created by this concept of being replaced," said Oren Segal, the director of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. "When you think your race is going to go extinct, you will do anything to protect that."
Mr. Camus has sought to distance himself from violent white supremacists, writing in an email to The New York Times that nonviolence was central to his philosophy. Yet he did not shy away from saying he believed that people of white European descent were at risk of being wiped out by immigrants and people of color. If white supremacists held those views, "Good for them," he wrote. "That is indeed my belief."
The shooting in the immigrant-rich town of El Paso on Saturday was among the deadliest attacks in the United States motivated by white extremism since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people, according to the A.D.L. About 56 percent of the extremist murders committed in the United States over the past decade were carried out by people espousing white supremacist ideology such as the great replacement, A.D.L. research shows.
Mr. Camus disputed his role in inspiring the accused El Paso gunman, whose screed, posted online minutes before the massacre, said the attack was the result of a "Hispanic invasion of Texas." Mr. Camus also denied influencing the man accused of killing 51 people in the mosque shootings in Christchurch, New Zealand, who wrote a document using the same title as Mr. Camus's book, "The Great Replacement," before the vicious attack was carried out.
["It feels like being hunted: The El Paso attack has left many Latinos deeply shaken, raising questions about their place in American society.]
Mr. Camus questioned whether either gunman could have read his book because it has not been translated into English, he said. The themes however have been repeated on far-right websites and by right-wing pundits.
Analysts say Mr. Camus's writing -- and the idea of a great replacement -- has undoubtedly influenced the conversation among American white nationalists. The ideas espoused in the great replacement build on the most popular white supremacist talking point -- the false notion that white people are at risk of genocide, said Heidi Beirich, the director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center.
That is a shift in the narrative from 20 years ago, she said, when white supremacists mostly talked about their superiority as a race. Now, their discussions center on a belief that they are the victims of nonwhite invasions, Ms. Beirich said.
"If you're getting invaded, what do you need to do?" she asked, explaining the logic of white supremacists. "You need to repel the invaders."
People who have that mind-set -- fueled by the belief that violently defending the white race is not only heroic but rational -- can be particularly lethal in this moment, experts said.
Ms. Beirich added that Mr. Camus's writings lend an "academic veneer and sophisticatedness" to these racist views.
"White nationalism isn't new, but what we need to recognize is that from Charlottesville to Pittsburgh to Poway to El Paso, these aren't outliers on a scatter plot," said Jonathan Greenblatt, the chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League. "These are data points on a trend line. And that's a trend line that indicates clearly and unambiguously that white supremacy is a global threat."
Replacement theory also perpetuates the false and anti-Semitic view that the end of the white race is part of a Jewish conspiracy.
During a march in Charlottesville two summers ago, white supremacists yelled, "Jews will not replace us," while carrying tiki torches. The following day, one of them killed a woman when he rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.
In April, a gunman entered a synagogue in Poway, Calif., and began shooting. Authorities believe the gunman posted a manifesto riddled with anti-Semitic, racist slurs before the attack. Like the El Paso document, the screed declared support for the shooting in Christchurch and warned of the great replacement.
"It is the conspiracy theory du jour that they use to make sense of the world and justify their racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic worldview," Mr. Greenblatt said.
Representative Steve King of Iowa espoused replacement-theory talking points in an interview with a far-right Austrian publication last year. President Trump has repeatedly referred to an "invasion" of migrants into the country. And his idea for a border wall is the kind of thing that excites replacement-theory adherents, said Jeff Schoep, a former leader of a neo-Nazi organization.
"It's probably one of the greatest fears that people in the movement have, is basically being replaced," said Mr. Schoep, who says he now denounces white supremacist views.
Mr. Camus's philosophy aligns lock-step with a tradition of white supremacist ideology that dates to Madison Grant, "the most influential racist in American history," said Jonathan Spiro, a historian who is the chief academic officer at Castleton University.
Grant's 1916 book, "The Passing of the Great Race," argued that Nordics were the master race and lamented the threat posed by people who were not white. His book was a basis for the Immigration Act of 1924 that mostly limited immigration into the United States to people from Western Europe, and it inspired Adolf Hitler, who used the book as a manual for his eugenic practices, said Dr. Spiro, who wrote a biography of Grant.
Mr. Camus's theory of the great replacement shares the same ideas found in Grant's book, Dr. Spiro said.
Mr. Schoep, who is in his 40s and was the head of the National Socialist Movement, joined the white nationalist movement as a teenager. In his mind at the time, it was not about hate, he said.
"I was joining something to save my country, to save my race, to save my people," Mr. Schoep said. "Now I feel like that talk and some of that hate is coming to a head where it's more violent, more pronounced and people are doing terrible things."
That rising violence, as well as experiences he has had with people of other races, led Mr. Schoep to leave the movement this past winter, he said. He now disavows white supremacist beliefs, and he hopes that he can steer other white supremacists away from the movement, he said, adding that it will not be easy.
The sense of grievance among white nationalists remains deep, and many still feel marginalized, which leads to more attacks, Mr. Schoep said.
What happened in El Paso "is exactly the type of thing that concerns me and worries me for the future," he said. "And I don't think it's going to be the last one."
For Ibram X. Kendi, a historian and director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, that might be true, but it is not necessarily surprising.
"The United States has always been in the midst of a white nationalist terrorist crisis," said Mr. Kendi.

Texto completo: Healthcare decisions
It seems intuitively obvious and necessary to me that medical care should be given to all in need no matter their personal circumstances or personal lifestyle choices-be they citizens, illegal aliens, or even visitors. Obviously, it needs to be paid for - the hows of that debate are myriad.
What doesn't seem to be addressed is who will make the decisions about what one "needs" and what one "wants" for health care. Will it be the legislators who seem capable only of yelling at each other? Will it be religious factions who may or may not approve of birth control or abortions or gender surgery or viagra? At what point does care start or stop?
We can't come to an agreement about when life begins much less agree on the rights of terminally ill to die. Are experimental drugs or procedures experimenting with peoples' lives or taxpayers' dollars?
In January, because of international travel plans, I was advised by my doctor and the CDC to get Hepatitis A vaccine. It is a two-part drug and I was told to come back in six months for the second injection. When I returned for Part 2, the doctor's office told me Medicare would not authorize Part 2 of the drug.
They authorized Part 1 but not Part 2. Who is making these decisions?

Ban assault weapons
As a forensic psychiatrist, I have evaluated many people who were potentially violent, to themselves and to others. The first step to minimize any harm is to remove any dangerous weapons from the individual.
The same approach is needed for our country and, in my opinion, the first step should be a ban on assault weapons and it should happen immediately. Not only should the sale of assault weapons be banned but all that are currently owned need to be bought back.
Although other steps are needed, such as universal background checks, they will not be as effective in minimizing deaths from violent attacks as the assault weapon ban. We may not immediately stop the attacks but we can lessen the effects while adopting a more comprehensive approach to the problem.
Anything less than this is an abdication of responsibility by our government.

Front page
What newspaper am I reading? Understanding that The Capital had a horrific loss of talent last year, I have been very patient with the number of articles that are copy and pasted from The Washington Post and New York Times (aka Washington Bureau). The Monday edition is really challenging me to keep my subscription to The Capital.
I gave up on the Post over 15 years ago after reading it my entire life. The Post is nothing more than free strategic communications for the Democrat party.
Page 1 top left, Trump hit piece (Washington Post), Page 2 (Washington Post only), Page 6 (Washington Post 2 articles), Page 7 (Opinion piece begins with "Trump lies"). Where is the balance?
Will the Washington Times or Examiner not cooperate with you? Please help me understand who is now in control of your paper.

Light on the water
I have read and loved The Capital for 75 years, since I was small enough to have to spread it on the floor to read the comics. One reason I still like it is that the front page almost always has a nice story with local "good news" events and pictures.
Joshua McKerrow's pictures and story motivated me to send my compliments - lights on water and Spa Creek where I grew up; and I remember A. Aubrey Bodine's photography (The Capital, Aug. 6).
McKerrow writes almost poetically. He deserves a raise!

Texto completo: EL PASO — Aiming to play the traditional role of healer during national tragedy, President Trump paid visits Wednesday to two cities reeling from mass shootings that left 31 dead and dozens more wounded.
But his divisive words preceded him, protests greeted him in Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso, and biting political attacks soon followed.
Flying with first lady Melania Trump from Dayton to El Paso, he tweeted attacks on the Democratic mayor of Dayton and a Democratic senator who he said had not accurately described the closed-door sessions at a Dayton hospital earlier in the day.
And earlier on Wednesday, Trump held a 20-minute session with reporters in which he unloaded many of his usual grievances, displaying little hesitation to engage in politics on a day of grief for many people around the country.
He mocked Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate for president who once represented El Paso in Congress, for having a “phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage" and he linked the Dayton shooter to liberal politicians. Later, in his comments to reporters, Trump repeated attacks on illegal immigrants and called another Democratic presidential candidate, former vice president Joe Biden, “a pretty incompetent guy" who has “truly lost his fastball."
The president held back from making any further public statements once he arrived in Dayton on Wednesday morning, visiting privately with families and victims of the city's weekend massacre as well as emergency and hospital workers. But even as his spokeswoman said the event was never designed as a photo op, Dan Scavino, the president's social media director, posted on Twitter pictures from inside Miami Valley Hospital. “The President was treated like a Rock Star inside the hospital, which was all caught on video," he tweeted. “They all loved seeing their great President!"
Nan Whaley, the Democratic mayor of Dayton, and Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, joined Trump on the visit to the hospital and said they each pressed the president to take more aggressive action to pass gun control legislation after this weekend's shootings in the two cities.
Brown and Whaley said the president refused to commit to signing a universal background check bill, but told them that he would “get things done." Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters that he supported background checks, but did not provide details about what legislation he might sign.
He also said he sees "no political appetite" for banning assault rifles.
Brown said Trump “was received as well as you can expect by the patients."
“They are hurting," Brown said. “He was comforting. He and Melania did the right things. It's his job in part to comfort people. I'm glad he did it."
But in a news conference soon after Trump departed Dayton for El Paso, Whaley added: “I'm not holding my breath. Too often we see inaction, because they're waiting just for time, to forget that nine people died in Dayton because of a gun that shouldn't be legal, frankly."
Flying on Air Force One, Trump attacked the senator and the mayor on Twitter, saying they had misrepresented what happened inside the hospital. “Their news conference after I left for El Paso was a fraud," the president wrote. “It bore no resemblance to what took place."
Scavino added on Twitter: “They are disgraceful politicians, doing nothing but politicizing a mass shooting, at every turn they can."
Trump's motorcade from the Dayton airport passed two recreational vehicles adorned with pro-Trump signs and flags, as well as one man standing outside a store advertising survival supplies with a sign that appeared to object to so-called red-flag laws that prevent people with mental illness from getting guns: “Red Flag Is Dystopic Future."
But Trump's visit was also met with small groups of protesters who gathered to say that he was not welcome in their community, waving signs that said “Dump Trump" and “Do Something!" The protesters were met by counterdemonstrators who waved signs supportive of Trump.
The main protest of about a hundred people materialized along a stretch of South Main Street, in a grassy field a few blocks from the hospital where Trump was visiting some of the shooting victims.
Michael Prince, 55 — burly, tattooed, and bushy-bearded — stood next to Jim Madewell, 71 — burly, tattooed, and bushy-bearded — and watched the scene.
Madewell, a retired printing press foreman who said he lives 100 yards from the Dayton gunman's house, said Trump's language “throws gasoline on the fire," and that leads to violence. “He feeds on negativity and hate and fear," Madewell said.
During the president's stop in Dayton, Biden's campaign released excerpts from a speech the former vice president later delivered in Iowa. In the remarks, Biden accused Trump of fanning the flames of white supremacy and racism.
Speaking to reporters before he left Washington, Trump dismissed critics who have suggested that his rhetoric on race and immigration is partly to blame for a rise in hate-inspired violence such as that in El Paso.
"I think my rhetoric brings people together," Trump said, adding that he is "concerned about the rise of any group of hate."
"I don't like it," he said. "Whether it's white supremacy, whether it's any other kind of supremacy."
He called his critics "people who are looking for political gain."
Trump was asked to respond to another comment by Biden in which he said the president had more in common with George Wallace than George Washington.
“Well, Joe is a pretty incompetent guy," Trump said. “I've watched his interviews. I've watched what he said and how he said it. And I wouldn't have rated him very high in the first place. But Joe Biden has truly lost his fastball, that I could tell you."
Trump did not arrive in El Paso until about 4:30 p.m. Eastern time, but as in Dayton, protesters gathered before his arrival, demonstrating their anger about what they said was his divisive language and unwillingness to push for aggressive gun control measures. Judy Lugo, the president of the Texas State Employees Union, which represents 10,000 state workers, was one of the people who said Trump should not have come to El Paso.
“I don't think it's appropriate," Lugo said of the president's visit. “The people here need to mourn, they need to be left alone. They don't need him coming down saying how sorry he is when people don't think he's sorry."

Texto completo: RETAIL
More Sears and Kmart stores to close, including one in Palmer The padlocks are coming out again for Sears stores. The struggling retailer will shutter 26 more of its large-format Sears and Kmart stores in late October, it revealed on its website. Any of the locations with auto centers will close those divisions in late August, it said. Liquidation sales are expected to start as soon as next week. The Kmart store in Palmer is among those that will close. The once-dominant chain, which has already closed more than 100 locations, is trying to rebuild itself by investing in smaller footprint stores, a key tenet of its turnaround plan. BLOOMBERG
DELIVERY
FedEx cutting ties with Amazon FedEx is severing ties with Amazon as the online retailer builds out its own delivery fleet and becomes more of a threat. The announcement Wednesday that FedEx would no longer make ground deliveries for Amazon comes two months after the delivery company said it was terminating its air delivery contract with Amazon. Amazon.com Inc. is building its own fleet of ground and air transportation to have more control of how its packages are delivered and cut its reliance on FedEx, UPS, and the US Postal Service. The Seattle-based company has been leasing jets, building several package-sorting hubs at airports, and launching a program that lets contractors start businesses delivering packages in vans stamped with the Amazon logo.

Waffle House chairman, former housekeeper settle lawsuit A settlement has been reached in a seven-year long dispute between Waffle House Chairman Joseph Rogers Jr. and his former housekeeper, who secretly recorded them having sex. The confidential deal was announced moments after Rogers's attorney gave his opening statement in a civil trial Tuesday in a Georgia courtroom. News outlets report the terms weren't disclosed and both sides declined to comment. Rogers accused his former housekeeper Mye Brindle in a lawsuit filed in 2012 of recording their sexual encounters in an attempt to extort him. Rogers also sued Brindle's attorneys for allegedly conspiring with her. Brindle said she recorded the acts as proof of Rogers's repeated sexual harassment. Brindle and her attorneys were indicted on unlawful surveillance charges but were cleared last year. ASSOCIATED PRESS

taking a lightsaber to disney's profits The force may be with them, but the bucks, apparently, are not. Walt Disney Co. shares took their worst tumble in nearly four years after the opening of the most highly anticipated theme-park attraction in the company's history fell flat, hammering results in its latest quarter. Profit at the company's domestic resorts slumped in the period, which was marked by the ballyhooed opening of Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, the largest addition ever to the Disneyland resort in Anaheim, Calif. A second version of the space-themed land opens in Florida this month. The earnings shortfall was a shock to investors who were counting on Disney's market-dominating theme parks and films to shoulder the burden of growth as the company goes head to head with Netflix Inc. in streaming.

PHARMACIES
CVS raises earnings forecast once again CVS Health Corp. raised its 2019 earnings forecast for the second time this year after topping Wall Street's estimates, driven by growing revenue and profit at the drug-benefits unit. The company, based in Woonsocket, R.I., expects adjusted earnings for the year to be $6.89 to $7 per share, an increase from its May forecast of $6.75 to $6.90. CVS's success as a mix of corner pharmacies, drug-benefit services, and health insurance is a contrast to its competitors. While CVS raised its forecast, retail rival Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. has been slashing costs and closing stores — including Tuesday's announcement that it would shut down 200 more US locations.

Match Group shares soar, fueled by Tinder subscriber growth Like striking a match to a tinder box? Explosive growth at the dating app Tinder is propelling Match Group Inc. shares to record highs. The dating company gave an optimistic earnings report and outlook, fueled by Tinder's growth. The shares gained as much as 24 percent, the most intraday since May 2016. Match is owned by billionaire Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp. Since going public in 2015, Match has quadrupled its market capitalization, largely driven by explosive growth in Tinder, the app where people swipe right on photos of prospective dates to indicate romantic interest.

REAL ESTATE
Prices retreat in some of the costliest markets Home prices slipped in some of the costliest US markets in the second quarter, a sign that would-be buyers are sitting out the competition for a scarcity of affordable properties. The median price for a previously owned single-family house increased 4.3 percent from a year earlier to $279,600, the National Association of Realtors said in a report Wednesday. Prices climbed in 162 of 178 metropolitan areas measured. The high-cost regions of San Jose, San Francisco, and Honolulu were among those where prices fell. Median single-family prices in Greater Boston were up 2.2 percent over the second quarter in 2018, to $506,700. BLOOMBERG
MEDIA
For New York Times, the news is not good The New York Times is having a week from hell. After the publisher drew flak for a headline earlier this week on President Trump and suffered a legal setback against Sarah Palin on Tuesday, the company warned that advertising revenue would decline sharply this quarter. The outlook sent New York Times Co. shares down 20 percent Wednesday — their worst intraday plunge in almost seven years — and cast a shadow on what had been an upbeat year for the Gray Lady. The stock was up 60 percent in 2019 through Tuesday, fueled by signs that the 168-year-old publisher is successfully pivoting to the digital age. The Times expects ad revenue to decrease by a percentage in the high-single digits in the third quarter. The stock rout was another headache in a week full of them. On Monday, presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke slammed the newspaper for running the print headline “Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism," which he and other critics said mischaracterized the story in favor of the president. New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet acknowledged to the Daily Beast that it was a “bad headline" but noted that it was quickly changed. On Tuesday, the Times learned that it must face a defamation lawsuit by Palin, the former Alaska governor, over an editorial that linked her to the shooting of Arizona lawmaker Gabrielle Giffords.

Nike buys Boston analytics company Nike Inc. has purchased a data-science firm that it believes will provide insight into what its customers want, and how to deliver it. The acquisition of Boston-based Celect dovetails with Nike's biggest initiative — its digital presence. In just the past year, Nike has opened a new type of retail store, enhanced its member app, and unveiled a new product line, all of which is centered on learning more about its customers on an individual level. Celect, which last year raised $15 million from a handful of investors, offers predictive analytics that will help Nike optimize retail inventory and predict consumer patterns. BLOOMBERG

Texto completo: Editor,
I want to comment on race, racism and immigration. Democrats are lurching to the left toward socialism with their liberal, left-wing policies.
It’s very disturbing when some of the columnists in this paper who work for The New York Times, namely Paul Krugman, call President Donald Trump a “racing racist” and a “whole supremacist.” Charles Blow says Trump supporters are like dogs who eat their own vomit.
The election of President Trump stopped socialism in its tracks and he deserves a second term.
These 2020 Democrats are endorsing policies bent on ruining our country, especially abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and advocating open borders.
People on the left have been saying for years that the Republican Party is run by “old white men.” But, now it’s filtering to the Democrats, where Joe Biden must be too male and too pale.
In other words it has become a party of “people of color,” if you go by the views of these radical four women, newly elected to Congress, known as “The Squad.” These four people don’t acknowledge Donald Trump as president, only as the occupant of the White House. They also say that blacks, browns, Muslims and others should think and act like they do.
Many people on the left in this country believe we have an illegitimate government and that an occupying force that treated American Indians and African slaves unjustly and will use all the amendments to the Constitution, especially the First Amendment involving free speech, to tear down this country.
This immigration crisis started with the 1965 Legal Immigrant Act. The act of “immaculate deception,” it was supposed to keep the same racial and ethnic balance, which was 89%white. That was one of the biggest lies in American history. This all came to be by the Godfathers of that act: President Lyndon Johnson (D), Sen. Edward Kennedy, Sen. Phil Art (D) and Rep. Emmanuel Celler (D). This all led to the immigration treason that’s been going on to this day.
Immigration from Europe by white Christians was virtually stopped and is now barely over 60%. And by 2042 or so, whites will be a minority.
Concerning illegal immigration, we have the open borders, crowds of leftist, liberal Democrats and their allies in the TV media, newspapers, Hollywood elites, people in sports - all contributing to aiding and abetting this underground of illegal aliens that goes coast to coast.
This is an unfounded mandate imposed on hard-working middle Americans who have to pay for all the benefits that these immigrants, both legal and illegal, receive.
Will the deplorables, who number in the scores of millions, accept a future where the they and their children are to submit to permanent roles by people who detest them and see them as racists, sexists and fascists?

Texto completo: Some Walmart employees are joining a growing number of people calling for the nation's biggest retailer to stop selling guns or help curb gun violence following two mass shootings that left at least 31 people dead.
Organizers of the protest have asked their colleagues to walk off the job Wednesday afternoon to pressure Walmart to do more to end the gun violence that has shaken the country after 22 people were killed at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas, on Saturday, followed by another mass shooting that left nine dead in Dayton, Ohio.
Thomas Marshall, a Walmart category specialist in San Bruno California, who sent the initial messages calling for a protest, said that "many employees'' called in sick or wore black on Tuesday.
"The response was overwhelmingly positive, and we have already begun to organize additional demonstrations,'' Marshall said in an emailed response to USA TODAY,
But Walmart disagreed with that assessment of how employees responded.
“We’re only aware of two people who participated in the protest and those are the organizers, and both of those individuals came into the office yesterday but were not at their work stations,'' said Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove. "There’s no indication of unusual call-ins or attendance yesterday. ’’
Walmart not banning guns:Some advocates say it should

Hargrove added that "there are many more constructive avenues for associates to offer feedback, such as email or leader conversations, and the vast majority of associates who want to share their views are taking advantage of those options. "
Since the mass shootings, the founder of Guns Down America has said on Twitter and in interviews that Walmart should stop selling guns, and support other measures such as gun buybacks, to spur change in the nation's gun policies. Actress and advocate Alyssa Milano also took to Twitter the day of the El Paso shooting to call on Walmart to end gun sales.
And in an open letter to Walmart's chief executive officer, Doug McMillon, that posted Monday, New York Times columnist and CNBC "Squawk Box" co-anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin called on the retailer to use its leverage with institutions like JP Morgan Chase Bank and Apple to help stem gun violence.
On Monday, Marshall messaged Walmart colleagues through email and Slack, noting that Walmart had previously imposed more stringent rules around gun sales, such as raising the age to make a purchase from 18 to 21.
"By voicing our concern as associates we would hopefully be able to influence leadership and company culture as a whole to take a defiant stance against gun violence, especially in the wake of the recent tragedies that hit so close to home for us,'' Marshall wrote.
"Walmart has completely deactivated our access and accounts. We have been shut out of all systems, essentially ending our jobs without yet firing us,'' Marshall said in an email. "We will be seeking legal counsel in this matter. ''
Walmart's Hargrove says that "company channels are provided to help employees do their work . . . When he returns to work, he will regain access to the channels pending review of the circumstances. ’’
Some gun control advocates have praised Walmart's previous efforts to be more restrictive, including halting the sale of handguns in the early 1990s, ending the sales of modern sporting rifles in 2015, and raising the age of those who could buy firearms to 21 in 2018.
But Walmart said this week that it doesn't plan to stop selling guns.
The nation has seen a rash of shootings in recent days, reigniting debate about the need for gun control as well a conversation about the rise of white supremacy.
Just days before Saturday's mass shooting in Texas, two people were shot and killed in a Walmart store in Southaven, Mississippi. That same week, three people were shot and killed at the Gilroy Garlic Festival in California.

'El Paso will not be quiet': Trump, Beto O'Rourke clash before presidential visit to El Paso

Resumen: Trump said former Rep. Beto O'Rourke should "be quiet" ahead of a visit to El Paso on Wednesday. "El Paso will not be quiet," O'Rourke responded.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Before a Wednesday trip to El Paso, Texas, to meet with survivors of a deadly mass shooting, President Donald Trump picked another fight with former Texas congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke.
While O'Rourke has said Trump should stay away from El Paso because of his past comments about migrants, Trump said in a tweet near midnight that his Democratic foe "should respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!"
O'Rourke quickly responded with a tweet saying that Trump's rhetoric disqualifies him from talking about a shooting by a man who said his motive was a Hispanic "invasion" of the United States.
"22 people in my hometown are dead after an act of terror inspired by your racism," said O'Rourke, who represented the city in Congress. "El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I. "
Trump will travel to El Paso and Dayton, Ohio, on Wednesday to meet with the victims of back-to-back shootings that have reopened a pointed debate over whether his own campaign trail rhetoric has contributed to the violence. The weekend shootings killed at least 31 people.
In his salvo, Trump also mocked O'Rourke's first name – "phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage" – as well as his standing in Democratic presidential polls. Trump also took credit for O'Rourke's loss in a 2018 Texas Senate race to incumbent Ted Cruz.
"I trounced him," said Trump, who made a campaign trip to Texas on Cruz's behalf.
In another pre-trip tweet, Trump again complained about news coverage surrounding the mass shootings, in this case a flap over how The New York Times changed a headline related to his Monday speech about the attacks.
Trump also called on the news media to play up reports that the shooter in Dayton had expressed support for Democrats like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Sex-sullied state park faces uncertain future

Texto completo: EOLA
In the beginning, it was an idyllic patch of forest above the Willamette River where pioneers traveling west of Salem would stop, have lunch and get water for horses and oxen at a spring of renowned purity.But one of Oregon's first state parks ran into trouble as the Capital City grew and spread, devolving into a place overwhelmed by drugs and sex.The New York Times called it "A Park That Ran With the Wrong Crowd." Visitors told the Statesman Journal horrifying stories about public lewdness. State police arrested eight in a high-profile sting.And so, Holman Wayside State Park was sealed off by concrete barricades, its bathroom destroyed, and more than a century of public use largely ended.
"What we really need to do is reboot the park," Oregon Parks and Recreation Department spokesman Chris Havel told the New York Times in 2007. "The plan is to let the reputation die off a little bit, then come back."
The reboot never came to pass.
After a few ideas fizzled, Holman turned into something of a ghost park.
Blackberries and weeds are reclaiming the parking lot. A rusted water tank is covered by ivy. And a forested trail that climbs to views across the Willamette River ends at a sign saying, "Announce Yourself Here!" and a homeless camp.
Now, the 10-acre park is on what officials call a list of "non-essential" proprieties considered for disposal. That means it could be transferred to another owner, including an agency or county, or sold at auction.
"This is one of those properties that doesn't really serve a purpose in the state park system anymore," Havel told the Statesman Journal. "That said, if somebody had a brilliant idea for what to do with Holman, we'd take that call."
The early days Holman Wayside — or what remains of it — is located at the intersection of Doaks Ferry Road and Oregon Highway 22, just across from the Rock N Rogers Eola Inn about four miles west of Salem.
The route has long been a busy one for travelers headed to Dallas or the Oregon Coast, even back in the 1850s, when pioneers traveled the Salem-Dallas territorial road on horseback or with oxen teams.
Thomas and Cora Holman owned land along the road with a spring, and for decades the couple allowed travelers to stop, relax and refresh their animals before moving on.
In 1922, the Holmans sold their property for $1,000 to create one of Oregon's first state parks.
"The tradition of it being a place where travelers stopped to rest continued when it became a state park," Havel said. "You would have seen horses and early automobiles, people having picnics, and a great view of the river.
"Oregon's first version of a state park were these little pockets along the highways, and Holman was a great example."
The rise of a bad reputation It's unclear exactly when Holman went from a wholesome place for a picnic to a park with a reputation for illegal drugs and sexual liaisons.
Statesman Journal archives suggest Holman was a typical state park through the 1970s, with the biggest problems coming from trying to harness the spring and turn it into a drinking fountain.
But by the late 1980s and early '90s, more serious problems were apparent.
"This last year has just been terrible," Dan Lucas, an assistant park manager at Holman, told the Statesman Journal in 1989. He was referring to people continually destroying the park's restrooms. In 1991, Holman was closed for three weeks due to "extensive vandalism" that included the destruction of the sink, toilets, light fixtures and water fountain.
Police at the time blamed the problems on the park's close proximity to Salem's growing urban center. The city's population had grown nearly 60 percent since 1970, up to 107,000.
Vandalism was only part of the problem. At some point, the park became a hotbed for public sex, according to numerous reports. Polk County police conducted a sting as early as 1992 that led to arrests for public indecency.
A McDonalds at Holman? Oregon's state parks department was facing a crisis in the mid-1990s.
Underfunded for decades and overwhelmed by maintenance costs, the department was planning to shut down 65 state parks.
Enter a unique idea: corporate sponsorship.
For the most part, the idea was to allow corporate advertising at places like Silver Falls or Smith Rock. But there also was talk of adding a scaled-down McDonalds at Holman specifically, according to a 1996 Statesman Journal story.
"If we were to do it, we'd do a facility that would kind of blend in," Rob Wessberg, a state parks official, said in 1996. "I see it as a revenue generator, because it seems like society is always looking for a place to go to the restroom and grab a bite to eat."
The idea never went anywhere because in 1998 voters approved Measure 66 that dedicated 15 percent of profits from the Oregon Lottery to parks and salmon recovery programs.
The influx of cash meant not only did Oregon not have to close parks, but the park system would expand substantially over the next decade.
A McDonalds was no longer necessary at Holman. But the problems at the park didn't go away.
The breaking point came in 2007. After multiple visitors reported being propositioned for sex — and 100 reported incidents in 12 months — police conducted a sting that led to the arrest of eight men for public indecency.
In response, barricades were placed across Holman's parking lot as parks officials planned to close the park for "up to one year."
"I think this is necessary because the park isn't serving a good purpose for the community," Polk County Sheriff Bob Wolfe said at the time.
Could Holman be rebooted? A few attempts were made to reopen Holman as something new.
An early idea came from a group of mountain bikers that wanted to build a trails system with jumps and obstacles similar to the Black Rock Mountain Bike area outside Falls City.
But nothing gained traction.
Havel said there are multiple problems.
First, the park is tightly surrounded by roads — Highway 22, Doaks Ferry and Cherry Hill Lane on the far side.
Second, the steep hillside, which today is filled with dense forest and a meadow, is prone to landslides, Havel said. There also is a broken water line from the old spring.
"It's basically shoehorned into a steep triangle that defies a lot of beneficial uses," Havel said.
The park does host a bike path that is still used, helping connect a paved route from Salem to Monmouth, and parks officials are eager to protect that use.
Some believe the park should embrace recreation and turn Holman into a centerpiece for a trails system in West Salem.
"Park at Holman, have it lit with bathrooms open," said Salem trails advocate Mark Wigg. "Then peddle or scooter into town on the multi-use path."
Eventually, Wigg hopes to complete a pedestrian overpass of Highway 22 that connects to a proposed rail-to-trail along the Willamette to Edgewater.
"We will need bathrooms and parking for visitors wanting to do the loop," Wigg said, although the route could be a long way off.
There is plenty of potential for a park on its own merits as well — a mostly intact parking lot and forested trails with nice views. It has close proximity to a large population in West Salem that values parks. It's not difficult to see it becoming a place similar to the Salem Audubon Nature Reserve or Brush College Park, which are both in West Salem.
That said, reopening the park would cost time and resources, and is likely to face the same type of problems that closed it. A number of homeless camps are there currently.
Sale or transfer of Holman The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department owns numerous small properties statewide, and some of them are considered "non-essential" and candidates for "disposal."
Most are small parcels — waysides or holdings — that don't fit into the parks system, Havel said.
Holman currently fits that billing.
When disposing of a property, officials first identify other government agencies that it can transfer the property to. That could include a state agency, such as the Oregon Department of Transportation, or an owner such as Polk County.
In the past 10 years, Oregon's state parks department has transferred property to another agency 13 times. Currently, for example, Cascadia State Park is being signed over to Linn County to manage. In these types of cases, the properties usually serve the same role and the public doesn't notice the difference.
"The first thing we always do is reach out to a partner to take over the park in a way that keeps it public," Havel said.
But sometimes nobody wants the park, and if selling the land to a private business will help raise funds for other parks in the system, that option is considered.
In the past 10 years, parks property has been sold to private companies three times. The most noteworthy was in 2017, when the agency sold 37 acres of Washburne State Wayside near Monroe for $255,750 to Shiloh Forestry, Inc., which promptly clear-cut the property.
"It's only after an exhaustive search that we start entertaining the idea of putting it up for sale," Havel said. "It's at the end of a public process and a long chain."
At Holman, they haven't reached that point yet. ODOT has been using the site occasionally for staging equipment, which has slowed down the process.
But eventually, the hard question of what to do with Holman will need to be answered.
Should it be given a second life as a park or center for recreation?
Should it be sold to a land developer for low-income housing or another new use?
For more than a century it was a place for repose and relaxation below bigleaf maples and Douglas fir, on the banks of the Willamette. What will the next century bring?

Texto completo: Suit against Boy Scouts says new abuse claims uncovered
Lawyers bringing a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America said Tuesday they believe they've turned up allegations of sexual abuse against more than 350 people not previously identified in files released by the organization.
Attorneys with the Abused in Scouting group filed a lawsuit Monday in Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, alleging a one-time scout leader sexually abused a minor identified only by initials.
The suit alleges that the abuse of the then-12- or 13-year-old victim by an assistant scout leader began in 1974 or 1975 and continued until about 1980.
It also says that the lawyers received allegations of abuse from their clients against more than 350 people involved with the scouts who had not previously been named.
The Irving, Texas-based scouts compiled so-called ineligible volunteer files for years on people considered to pose a risk of abuse, and about 5,000 of these files have been made public as a result of court action.
Monday's suit is claiming that the lawyers now have hundreds of names that were not in those public files. It does not list the names.
An email message seeking comment was sent to the Boy Scouts.
The lawsuit comes as states have begun changing their statutes of limitations to make it easier for long-ago victims of sexual assault can seek damages in court.
The Boy Scouts have said previously that when any volunteer is added to the database for suspected abuse, "they are reported to law enforcement, removed entirely from any Scouting and prohibited from rejoining anywhere."

China vows to counter if US places midrange arms in Asia
BEIJING - China said Tuesday that it "will not stand idly by" and will take countermeasures if the U.S. deploys intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region, which Washington has said it plans to do within months.
The statement from the director of the Foreign Ministry's Arms Control Department, Fu Cong, follows the U.S. withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a move Fu said would have a "direct negative impact on the global strategic stability" as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.
Fu also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to "exercise prudence" and not allow the United States to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would "not serve the national security interests of these countries."

Court allows Palin's lawsuit against NY Times to proceed
NEW YORK - The New York Times Co. must face a defamation lawsuit by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin over a 2017 editorial that linked her to the 2011 shooting of Sen. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a federal appeals court said.
The ruling is a win for the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate, though the court said the bar remains high for Palin ultimately to prevail in the case.
The 21-page decision, which reinstated a lawsuit dismissed by a lower-court judge, is largely procedural, with the New York-based appeals court saying Palin's complaint "plausibly states a claim for defamation."
But it now allows her lawyers to obtain documents from The New York Times Co. and also question editorial page editor James Bennet.

Peter Strzok sues FBI for firing him over anti-Trump texts
WASHINGTON - A veteran FBI agent who wrote derogatory text messages about Donald Trump filed a lawsuit Tuesday charging the bureau caved to "unrelenting pressure" from the president when it fired him.
The suit from Peter Strzok also alleges he was unfairly punished for expressing his political opinions, and that the Justice Department violated his privacy when it shared hundreds of his text messages with reporters.
"This campaign to publicly vilify Special Agent Strzok contributed to the FBI's ultimate decision to unlawfully terminate him," the lawsuit says.
The complaint revisits a political drama that was seized on by conservative critics of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation as proof that the bureau was biased against Trump.

US envoy to Russia Jon Huntsman to resign post
WASHINGTON - Jon Huntsman, the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is resigning from the diplomatic post he has held for almost two years, a period marked by growing confrontation and friction between Moscow and Washington.
In a resignation letter sent Tuesday to President Donald Trump, Huntsman characterized his tenure as a "historically difficult" time in bilateral relations. He will depart Oct. 3.
Huntsman had resigned during his second term as Utah governor in 2009 and became the U.S. ambassador to China under the Obama administration. He left that post two years later for an unsuccessful run for president. When he became ambassador to Moscow, he said he would take the job for two years.
In his resignation letter Huntsman, 59, said he wanted to return "to reconnect with our growing family and responsibilities."

Trump, RNC challenge California law on tax returns
WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits Tuesday against California officials, challenging a new law that would bar Trump from appearing on the state's primary ballot next year if he declines to disclose his tax returns.
The federal lawsuits, which were threatened last week when Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill into law, argue that the measure requiring presidential and gubernatorial candidates to release five years of tax returns runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution.
Newsom responded on Twitter to the lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento: "There's an easy fix Mr. President - release your tax returns as you promised during the campaign and follow the precedent of every president since 1973."

In Britain: A youth court in London ordered a teenager held on an attempted murder charge Tuesday for allegedly throwing a 6-year-old boy from a viewing area at the top of the British capital's Tate Modern museum.
The French boy was a short distance from his parents Sunday when he was picked up and thrown over the railing of the 10th-floor observation deck.
The police said other museum visitors stopped a 17-year-old British citizen from leaving until officers arrived, and that the two boys had no prior connection.
The 6-year-old is hospitalized in critical but stable condition with a sustained brain bleed and fractures to his spine, legs and arms.

Texto completo: In March, a 28-year-old Australian man walked into the Al Noor Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. While streaming video live on Facebook, he proceeded to shoot dozens of people, killing 42 of them, before driving to a second mosque and again opening fire.
By the time he was apprehended, the shooter had killed 51 people, wounded 49 and broadcast the slaughter around the world. He also posted a 74-page manifesto, drawing from white supremacist ideology and promoting ethnic cleansing.
The New Zealand shooting reflected a new and frightening development in the fight against extremist violence. The suspect exploited social media platforms and worldwide connectivity to advance his twisted ideology and used mass murder to amplify the message.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern promised a swift response and her government delivered in the days that followed. At her urging, the Parliament approved sweeping measures to remove semi-automatic weapons, including assault-style rifles and several other types of firearms, from public use.
And two months later, Ms. Ardern convened an international gathering of world leaders, policy makers and executives from the technology sector to discuss ways to root out hateful ideology, violent extremism and terrorism from the internet.
At its conclusion, the leaders of many governments - including French President Emmanuel Macron, then-British Prime Minister Theresa May and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - joined with representatives of Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter to sign a voluntary, non-binding pledge to do more to fight online extremism.
Though the summit was more of a brainstorming session than anything else and the final product was rather tepid and non-committal, President Donald Trump declined to attend and said the U.S. would not sign on to the "Christchurch Call."
At the time, the administration said the document may not comport with the First Amendment - a valid concern - and warned against federal government overstepping its bounds by regulating the content available on platforms created and controlled by private, independent companies.
Yet, this president has been very quick to criticize, without evidence, those same companies for suppressing speech favorable to him.
And it is interesting to review that refusal to participate in an international conference about stopping the spread of extremist ideology online in light of the weekend's events, which saw shootings in two American cities that together claimed 31 lives.
In El Paso, Texas, the man charged with a Saturday shooting that killed 22 people allegedly traveled to that city from Dallas to battle the Hispanic "invasion" of the U.S. Reports indicate he told law enforcement following his arrest that he hoped to kill as many Mexicans as possible.
In an online manifesto he posted, the accused shooter specifically referenced the Christchurch attack as inspiration.
In Dayton, Ohio, the man who authorities say opened fire outside a nightclub early Sunday morning, killing nine people before he was shot and killed by police, may have harbored leftist sympathies, though there is not yet an indication his attack was ideologically driven.
However, a shooting one week prior in Gilroy, Calif., was allegedly perpetrated by someone hoping to advance the cause of white supremacy. And that's to say nothing of the 2015 shooting in Charleston, S.C., which the perpetrator claimed was intended to spark a race war.
According to a July 31 New York Times Op-Ed by Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant FBI director for counterintelligence, the FBI has made 90 arrests in domestic terrorism cases since October and 40% of its pending domestic terror investigations involve racially motivated extremism.
This isn't exclusively an American problem, though curbing this type of twisted worldview is a vexing challenge here, given the need to protect the rights enumerated in the First Amendment. Rather it's a global problem necessitating an international solution.
If the president is serious about fighting ideological extremism and white supremacy, reaching out to Ms. Ardern and working with the groundwork laid by the Christchurch Call is one way to swiftly turn words into action.
A version of this editorial was also published in The Virginian-Pilot.

President Plans Visits to Places Where Grief Mixes With Anger at Him

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump will visit Dayton, Ohio, and El Paso on Wednesday in an attempt to deliver a message of national unity and healing to two cities scarred by mass shootings over the weekend and where many grieving residents hold him responsible for inflaming the country's racial divisions.
The president stands accused of embracing hateful rhetoric and dodging calls for gun control, prompting divided feelings in both places about whether his arrival will provide comfort or incite rancor. Mr. Trump is scheduled to arrive in Ohio in the morning before traveling on to Texas in the afternoon.
The Democratic mayor of Dayton, Nan Whaley, said on Tuesday that she had been "disappointed" with Mr. Trump's remarks the day before about the two massacres, which left a combined 31 people dead. In a brief speech, Mr. Trump denounced white nationalism and called for more action to address mental illness and to combat online hate, but endorsed only minimal new gun control measures.
Still, Ms. Whaley said, she would respectfully welcome the nation's elected leader to her city.
"He's the president of the United States," Ms. Whaley said. "When he comes as president I will greet him. I hope he's coming here to add value and to help our community, and I hope it's not about just a press hit and I hope it's about him actually doing something."
The mood in El Paso is more fraught. Situated on the border with Mexico, it has been a longtime focal point for Mr. Trump's crusade to restrict immigration. And unlike in Dayton, the suspect in the Texas shooting left behind a political manifesto whose words echoed Mr. Trump's language about immigrants, the border and national identity.
Some of the city's political leaders have urged Mr. Trump not to visit, including the Democratic congresswoman from the area, Representative Veronica Escobar, and her predecessor, Beto O'Rourke, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. "He should not come out here while we're in mourning," Ms. Escobar said on Monday.
Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. O'Rourke on Twitter late Tuesday, saying he had a "phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage" and telling him to "be quiet." Mr. O'Rourke responded that "El Paso will not be quiet and neither will I."
But like Ms. Whaley in Dayton, El Paso's mayor, Dee Margo, a Republican, suggested that his respect for the presidency would outweigh any personal reservations he holds about Mr. Trump.
"He's coming out here on Wednesday," Mr. Margo said during a news conference. "And I want to clarify for the political spin that this is the office of the mayor of El Paso in an official capacity welcoming the office of the president of the United States, which I consider is my formal duty."
Senior Republican officials in both Texas and Ohio support Mr. Trump. Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, recently attended a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump, and Texas has two Republican senators and a governor who are all Trump allies. The only senior Democrat in the two states, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, told a talk radio host on Tuesday that he would not be present for Mr. Trump's visit.
White House officials defended the president on Wednesday from continued charges that his divisive remarks, particularly about immigrants and people of color, have fueled a rise in white nationalism and may be pushing unstable people toward violence.
"This is a very, very serious moment in our country's history," Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday. "This president recognizes the gravity of this moment."
But Mr. Gidley also sought to turn the tables on some of Mr. Trump's critics, pointing to other violent offenders who have shown sympathy for Democratic politicians. He cited a gunman who fired on a congressional baseball practice in June 2017, severely injuring Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, after writing anti-Trump and anti-Republican screeds. And he noted that a left-wing activist was shot and killed by the police last month after he showed up with a rifle and set fires outside a Department of Homeland Security detention center managed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Tacoma, Wash.
"We would never dream of blaming Ocasio-Cortez for someone who perpetrated a terrorist attack on a D.H.S. ICE facility because he used the same rhetoric she uses about concentration camps," Mr. Gidley said, referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. "You have to blame the people here who pulled the trigger."
The Trump campaign was unapologetic on Tuesday about a New York Times report on its Facebook advertisements that use the word "invasion," which featured prominently in the El Paso suspect's manifesto. A senior Trump political adviser had a single-word answer -- "no" -- when asked if the campaign would change the tenor of its ads.
Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, defended the ads.
"At any given moment, there are 100,000 migrants making their way through Mexico to attempt to break our immigration laws," Mr. Murtaugh said. "By objecting to an accurate description of the situation, Democrats and the media are trying to make it impossible to oppose illegal immigration without being called racist."
Even so, the Trump campaign's current political ads do not appear to have a heavy focus on immigration. The most recent "invasion" ads on Facebook began running in May, and none of them were still evident on Tuesday.
Mr. Trump's visits to Dayton and El Paso will not be the first time he has traveled to a grieving city with mixed emotions about his presence.
After a gunman who had a history of making anti-Semitic and anti-immigrant statements killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh last fall, Mr. Trump was similarly accused of inspiring right-wing radicals prone to violence.
After he announced plans to visit the city, the national Jewish social justice organization Bend the Arc wrote Mr. Trump an open letter, which collected tens of thousands of signatures, telling him that "you are not welcome in Pittsburgh until you fully denounce white nationalism." Upon his arrival in the city, Mr. Trump was received with chants of "Words have meaning!"
But a senior rabbi at Tree of Life suggested that the office of the presidency required a degree of respect. "I'm a citizen, and he's my president," said the rabbi, Jeffrey Myers. "He's certainly welcome."
In his scripted public remarks, Mr. Trump condemned the violence and pledged a fight for "a future of justice, safety, tolerance, morality, dignity and love."
Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that he would meet with emergency medical workers, law enforcement and victims of the shootings in the two cities. But it is not clear whether he will speak extemporaneously in either city, a circumstance that in the past has caused him to stray from prepared remarks on sensitive topics. Taking questions before he left for Pittsburgh last fall, Mr. Trump provoked fresh anger when he observed that the shooting might have been stopped earlier had an armed guard been posted at the synagogue.
Some residents of El Paso have not forgiven the president for describing their city in his State of the Union address as "one of our nation's most dangerous cities" before a barrier went up along the border.
"We need to stand in solidarity with those in pain, but also speak truth to power," Ruben Segura, 51, said at a community vigil on Sunday night. He condemned Mr. Trump for "demonizing immigrants" and racist language.
Many in El Paso say that their city has been misunderstood. Mr. Margo has pushed back against the image of the city as needing fortification, and points out that it is routinely ranked among the nation's safest.
He said on Monday that Mr. Trump had been "most gracious" during a recent phone call. Still, Mr. Margo did not play down tensions between the president and many in El Paso. In an interview, he stressed that he did not invite the president.
"The president can go anywhere he wants," Mr. Margo said. "He's president of the United States. I will greet him accordingly."

Texto completo: A group of Democratic senators has demanded in a letter sent to Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, that the internet giant convert its more than 120,000 temporary and contract workers to full-time employees.
The letter, written by Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also urged Google to stop its "anti-worker practices" and treat everyone at the company equally.
"Making these changes to your company's employment practices will ensure equal treatment of all Google workers and put an end to the two-tier employment structure you have perpetuated," Mr. Brown wrote. Among the 10 senators who signed were three running for president: Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
As of March, Google had more temporary workers than full-time employees -- 121,000 temps and contractors and 102,000 full-timers, according to company data viewed by The New York Times.
The senators' letter, which was sent last month, cites a May article by The Times that explained how Google had created a shadow work force of temps, contractors and other contingent workers brought in through staffing companies.
The senators pushed for a number of changes to how the company treats temps and contractors, including moving them to full-time status after six months as well as equalizing their wages and benefits with permanent staff.
While many of the temps and contractors sit in the same offices as Google employees and often do similar work, they usually make less money, have significantly worse benefit plans and do not enjoy the same rights.
Most of Google's contingent workers are technically employees of staffing agencies, although the company acts like the employer in most cases -- deciding when they work and what they do and assessing the quality of their work, according to current and former temps and contractors.
They have said they joined Google hoping to land a full-time job. When they encountered sexual harassment or pressure to perform unpaid overtime from Google employees, they were reluctant to speak up for fear that they would be labeled troublemakers and not receive full-time jobs.
Eileen Naughton, Google's vice president of people operations, said in a letter replying to the senators that the company strongly disagreed "with any suggestion that Google misuses independent contractors or temporary workers." She said the company's practices "accord with the highest industry standards."
Ms. Naughton said Google worked with staffing companies that had a particular expertise and could offer a "career path to employees." She added that using contingent workers was a common practice in almost every industry in the United States and the government.
She did not directly address any of the senators' policy demands. Mr. Pichai did not respond to the letter.
Though Silicon Valley companies are among the richest in the world, they have embraced employing temps. And while the pay for engineers and executives in Silicon Valley continues to rise, a growing faction of workers at many of those companies are not sharing in the success.
Temps and contractors account for 40 percent to 50 percent of workers at most technology firms, according to estimates by OnContracting, a site that helps people find tech contracting positions.
By keeping a large portion of their work forces contingent, companies like Google save money and maintain flexibility to decrease their head counts should business conditions change.
Younger tech companies like Uber and Lyft have built giant businesses that depend largely on the work of independent contractors, not employees.
Some Democrats are seizing on the issue as another sign of inequality in the country. That has put Google in their cross hairs.
Pete Buttigieg, the Democratic mayor of South Bend, Ind., who is also running for president, highlighted the widespread use of contingent labor at Google when laying out his economic plan to give more power to workers.
Mr. Brown has also been a vocal critic of the growing use of so-called "alternative work arrangements" by companies. In his letter to Google's chief executive, Mr. Brown said the company was using temporary and contract workers for more than short-term and nonessential work.
"We urge Google to end any abuses of these worker classifications and treat all Google workers equally," he wrote. He noted that the more than $ 800 billion in market value of Google's parent company, Alphabet, and Mr. Pichai's hundreds of millions of dollars in stock compensation made it "that much more difficult to stomach the mistreatment of these workers."
When Google's parent company reported quarterly earnings last month, Ruth Porat, the company's chief financial officer, said "some" customer support workers from staffing companies were being brought "in-house." A Google spokeswoman declined to clarify what constituted "some."
In addition to the other demands, Mr. Brown encouraged the company to eliminate noncompetition clauses and prohibit mandatory nondisclosure agreements about the terms and conditions of employment, including in contracts between temps and their staffing agencies.
He also said Google should accept liability for workplace violations that occurred with temps or contractors -- instead of passing responsibility onto staffing agencies.
"Adopting these policies will extend the economic security of Google employment to all individuals who contribute to the company's success," Mr. Brown said.
The other senators who signed the letter were Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, Patty Murray of Washington and Brian Schatz of Hawaii.

Texto completo: Former FBI Director James Comey commended President Trump for condemning white supremacy during scripted remarks but said Trump also needs to do so when not reading from a teleprompter.
“Reading words off a TelePrompTer is a good start. Now tell your next rally audience that racism and white supremacy are evil and you don’t want the support of anyone who disagrees,” Comey, who was fired by Trump in 2017, tweeted Monday.
Tweet
In a New York Times op-ed published Sunday, Comey said Trump’s silence on racism and white supremacy was damaging the nation.
“Every American president, knowing what lies deep within our country, bears a unique responsibility to say loudly and consistently that white supremacy is illegitimate, that encouraging a politics of racial resentment can spawn violence, and that violence aimed at people by virtue of their skin color is terrorism,” Comey wrote.
“Mr. President, because of what you have done, you owe us more than condolences sent via Twitter. You must stop trying to unleash and exploit the radioactive energy of racism,” he continued.
Trump denounced white supremacy and racism on Monday after back-to-back mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio over the weekend. The suspect in El Paso reportedly posted an anti-immigrant manifesto before the shooting.
“In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America,” Trump said in a speech to the nation.

PUSH TO LEGALIZE POT DEEPENS PARTISAN DIVISIONS IN 2020 RACE: Growing support for legalizing marijuana among Democratic presidential candidates may help them pick up some centrist voters in next year's election while also cementing the support of hard-line conservatives for President Trump.
The emphasis is on the word "may," writes Washington Examiner reporter Melissa Quinn. While the Democratic slate represents the most pro-cannabis field to set its sights on the White House to date, political analysts say the extent of the issue's influence is still far from clear.
“The big question is whether support for marijuana legalization is both broad and deep,” said Sam Kamin, a law professor at the University of Denver and marijuana policy expert. “It’s clearly broader than we would’ve thought a few years ago. Whether it’s something that will make voters choose one candidate over another remains to be seen.”
The vast majority of Democratic candidates favor legalizing marijuana at the federal level, while two believe that decision would be best left to the states. One candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, has limited his support to eliminating criminal penalties for possession of marijuana and erasing records of past convictions.
Their stances reflect an effort to take advantage of growing public support for legalizing marijuana, which hit 61% in 2018, according to the General Social Survey from NORC (originally the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago. Among the political parties, 69% of Democrats and 66% of independents back legalization, while only 42% of Republicans do.
Support among GOP voters has been steadily increasing since 2012, however, the survey found. An April CBS News poll showed support for marijuana legalization among Democrats at 72% and Republicans at 56%.
“It’s one of the most popular, bipartisan political issues in the country right now," and Democratic candidates realize "it’s something they can use to differentiate themselves and drive support,” said Erik Altieri, executive director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.

TRUMP BLAMES MASS SHOOTINGS ON MENTAL ILLNESS AND RACIST RHETORIC: The president blamed the weekend’s mass shootings on bigotry and mental illness Monday morning, saying the internet was partly responsible for influencing already “disturbed minds,” and condemning “racism, bigotry, and white supremacy” for spurring the attackers into action. He suggested Congress pass “red flag laws” to take firearms away from those deemed mentally ill.
The American Psychological Association blames hateful rhetoric and bigotry for gun violence: Dr. Rosie Phillips Davis, president of the American Psychological Association, said that blaming mass shootings on mental illness is both stigmatizing and not based on fact, as a very small percentage of shootings are carried out by people who have been diagnosed with a mental illness. She added that racism and bigotry are part of a “social contagion,” that have been shown to “have negative cognitive and behavioral effects on both children and adults and to increase anxiety, depression, self-defeating thoughts and avoidance behaviors.”
American Medical Association says gun violence must be called a public health crisis: In response to the two shootings, as well as to the hundreds of others that have already occurred in 2019, AMA president Dr. Patrice Harris said Congress must pass “common-sense steps, broadly supported by the American public” to prevent further fatalities. She added that policymakers “must also address the pathology of hatred” that she said has fueled mass shootings like those in Texas and Ohio.
FOX NEWS’ ED HENRY WANTS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF TRANSPLANT NEEDS AFTER DONATING PART OF HIS LIVER: After donating 30% of his liver to his sister Colleen, Fox News chief national correspondent Ed Henry wants to spread the word about how important living donation is. Henry is considering writing a book about his experience and may work with a nonprofit that encourages living organ donation to create a public service announcement. "A lot of people simply don't know about the ability to be a living donor," Henry told the Washington Examiner in an interview. Henry said he’s feeling fantastic, and will return to work in the fall.
WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL BOARD SAYS HEALTHCARE PROPOSALS FROM WARREN AND SANDERS WON’T WORK: In case you missed it, the Washington Post editorial board blasted both presidential contenders Thursday for proposing healthcare plans that lack “factual plausibility.” The headline of the piece, "Why go to the trouble of running for president to promote ideas that can’t work?" is a play on a jab that Elizabeth Warren directed at candidate and former congressman John Delaney last Tuesday. The Board said that Bernie Sanders’ Medicare for All proposal is ambitious but not well thought out: “The country faces big challenges, such as economic inequality and climate change, that call for creative solutions. They also call for wisdom, honesty and even a bit of modesty about government’s limitations.”
SUSAN B. ANTHONY LIST LAUNCHES DIGITAL AD CAMPAIGN TO URGE DEMOCRATS TO CONSIDER BORN-ALIVE ABORTION BILL IN THE HOUSE: Anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List launched a digital ad campaign to urge House Democrats to consider the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act for a vote. The ads will run throughout August recess, targeting Democrats in predominantly right-leaning districts.
MCCONNELL FRACTURES HIS SHOULDER IN HIS LOUISVILLE HOME: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tripped in his Louisville, Kentucky home Sunday morning, fracturing his shoulder and was briefly hospitalized. His spokesman David Popp said all is well and the senator has been treated and is working from home.

Going through the motions: Media elevate Democrats, cite bad stats, mock 'thoughts and prayers' in wake of deadly shootings

Texto completo: If you want original news of a mass shooting event, rely on local journalism. National newsrooms will serve you only aggregated reporting and political advocacy.
A gunman opened fire Saturday in a crowded Walmart in El Paso, Texas, killing 20 and injuring dozens more. Hours later, another gunman opened fire at a popular bar in Dayton, Ohio, killing nine and injuring 16.
Both events are tragic. Both call for continued mourning and prayer. Both raise serious questions about homegrown terrorism and what motivates this continued bloodshed.
Not now, say some at the nation's largest newsrooms. These gutless acts of violence are the perfect hook for political activism. Back-to-back shootings are the perfect excuse to hit the "correct" political targets.
The Washington Post, for example, assisted Democrats this weekend in attacking GOP lawmakers: “Politicians grieve for El Paso victims, with Democrats decrying GOP inaction on gun laws,” reads the headline.
The article begins:
Shortly after a gunman opened fire at a Walmart and shopping mall in El Paso, a shaken Beto O’Rourke took the stage at a labor forum in Las Vegas. The Democratic presidential hopeful and former congressman, who lives in the Texas border city, told the audience that he had just called his wife to make sure she was okay. He said the shooting shatters 'any illusion that we have that progress is inevitable' when it comes to tackling gun violence.
Republicans have only hollow "condolences" and "prayers" for shooting victims, the report claims. In contrast, Democrats are people of action and feeling, willing to do something.
"The Democratic presidential candidates are embracing gun control ... with emotional appeals against firearms violence and pledges to stand up to the NRA,” the story claims. “In the face of more and more mass shootings, particularly in schools, the ground on the issue has shifted from an embrace of a gun culture in many areas of the country, including some that Democrats hope to wrest from the president.”
The story adds: “For Democrats, the shooting has the potential to raise the profile of gun control.”
This sort of gives the game away. It is obvious gun-control advocates see shootings as opportunities to advance their agenda. Does the Washington Post see this? Does it not occur to the newspaper that it is being used in that effort? For what it is worth, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan is happy enough to comply. She wrote this weekend that it is time for newsrooms to choose a side in the gun violence debate.
Tweet
The takeaway here is not that the former New York Times public editor has called for media to choose sides. The takeaway is that Sullivan thinks it hasn’t already.
Then there is USA Today, which regurgitated bad data about the number of mass shootings in 2019. It published a report this weekend titled, “El Paso, Dayton make 251 mass shootings in the US in 216 days, more shootings than days in the year.” The story cites as its main source the Gun Violence Archive. As I have written before, the Gun Violence Archive is unreliable. Its “school shootings” database, for example, includes an incident involving a pellet gun. It also includes an accidental discharge during “public safety class.” Several others have noted the Gun Violence Archive's questionable statistics and methods. Yet newsrooms go on citing this group’s “findings” after every mass shooting event.
There is also CNN's hall monitor, Brian Stelter. He used the shootings this weekend to hit Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for offering prayers for the victims.
Tweet
Stelter (or a similar mind) searched the senator’s Twitter account for "prayer" and "prayers." He then highlighted those keywords, saving them as cropped pictures. Stelter later posted those images online, trotting out an iteration of the "thoughts and prayer" cliche. It is exactly what the victims would have wanted.

Texto completo: The New York Times has found a connection between President Trump and the alleged El Paso gunman.
To wit, Trump and Patrick Crusius use the same language to talk about illegal immigration.
Ignore that the shooter allegedly said in his manifesto that his radicalization predates Trump. For the New York Times, details like that should not get in the way of a good headline.
“El Paso Shooting Suspect’s Manifesto Echoes Trump’s Language,” reads the title to the Aug. 4 report.
The article begins:
At campaign rallies before last year’s midterm elections, President Trump repeatedly warned that America was under attack by immigrants heading for the border. 'You look at what is marching up, that is an invasion!' he declared at one rally. 'That is an invasion!' Nine months later, a 21-year-old white man is accused of opening fire in a Walmart in El Paso, killing 20 people and injuring dozens more after writing a manifesto railing against immigration and announcing that 'this attack is a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.'
It is not until the third paragraph that the reader learns of the "when" of the shooter's radicalization. To be clear, the problem is not that this information should appear earlier in the story. It is that its existence calls into question the entire premise of the New York Times’ article.
As if anticipating this argument, the report argues next: “But if Mr. Trump did not originally inspire the gunman, he has brought into the mainstream polarizing ideas and people once consigned to the fringes of American society.” To be safe, the story adds also that the people with whom the president associates himself is further proof of his culpability in the El Paso massacre.
“While other leaders have expressed concern about border security and the costs of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump has filled his public speeches and Twitter feed with sometimes false, fear-stoking language even as he welcomed to the White House a corps of hard-liners, demonizers and conspiracy theorists shunned by past presidents of both parties," the reads. "Because of this, Mr. Trump is ill equipped to provide the kind of unifying, healing force that other presidents projected in times of national tragedy."
Damned if he does, damned if he does not, according to the New York Times. The president is guilty and nothing he says or does will change that.
The article then includes this curious line: “Democratic presidential candidates wasted little time on Sunday pointing the finger at Mr. Trump, arguing that he had encouraged extremism with what they called hateful language.”
That is the exact same message of the New York Times report. That no one at the newspaper noticed the tone of its coverage is indistinguishable from the Democratic response says a lot.
The article concludes with these lines, “For their part, other Republicans made a point over the weekend of denouncing white nationalism, going where Mr. Trump himself would not.”
Trump condemned white nationalism Monday during an address from the White House.
This is almost as bad as the New York Times report titled, “Minutes Before El Paso Killing, Hate-Filled Manifesto Appears Online.” That story fails to mention until the very final paragraph that the shooter claims his bigotry predates Trump. It is more than 1,000 words before readers learn when the shooter embraced evil. That seems like something worth mentioning a little higher up in the story.
But, hey, there are political points on the table, and the New York Times is on it. After all, accusing political opponents of inspiring mass shootings is something of a specialty for the Grey Lady. It has this particular niche locked down.

Trump and Warren and Violence; Maybe politicians should stop blaming opponents for the actions of third parties.

Texto completo: "2020 Democrats lay blame on Trump's rhetoric for shootings," reports the Associated Press. Will some 2020 Democrats also end up blaming themselves as more evidence is collected about the shooters in El Paso and Dayton? Strange as it may seem for people not in the business of politics or punditry, it's popular in these fields to blame ideological rivals for the violent acts of third parties.
In remarks today at the White House, President Donald Trump appropriately responded to the violence with expressions of grief, condolences to the families of victims, and thanks for the brave, rapid and accurate response of police officers. Commenting specifically on the violence in Texas, Mr. Trump said:
The shooter in El Paso posted a manifesto online consumed by racist hate. In one voice, our nation must condemn racism, bigotry, and white supremacy. These sinister ideologies must be defeated. Hate has no place in America. Hatred warps the mind, ravages the heart, and devours the soul. We have asked the FBI to identify all further resources they need to investigate and disrupt hate crimes and domestic terrorism — whatever they need.
"Trump Condemns White Supremacy but Doesn't Propose Gun Laws After Shootings," responded a New York Times headline. The article by Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman says that "Mr. Trump stopped well short of endorsing the kind of broad gun control measures that activists and Democrats have sought for years, instead falling back on longtime Republican remedies, such as stronger action to address mental illness, violence in the media and violent video games."
To say the very least, it would be premature in the hours after the shooting for anyone to assert that mental illness was not a factor in the violence. It should also be noted that Mr. Trump was hardly rejecting other ideas to address gun violence. After describing his own priorities, he said:
These are just a few of the areas of cooperation that we can pursue. I am open and ready to listen and discuss all ideas that will actually work and make a very big difference.
Republicans and Democrats have proven that we can join together in a bipartisan fashion to address this plague. Last year, we enacted the STOP School Violence and Fix NICS Acts into law, providing grants to improve school safety and strengthening critical background checks for firearm purchases. At my direction, the Department of Justice banned bump stocks. Last year, we prosecuted a record number of firearms offenses. But there is so much more that we have to do.
Politicians in both parties might want to get the facts and learn more about potential motives before considering a legislative response. While the El Paso shooter left a manifesto, the Dayton shooter's beliefs seem to be up for debate. For example, left-leaning news outlets are generally saying there was no clear motive while some right-leaning outlets are pointing to a report from a website called Heavy.com which states :
Connor Betts, the Dayton, Ohio mass shooter, was a self-described "leftist," who wrote that he would happily vote for Democrat Elizabeth Warren, praised Satan, was upset about the 2016 presidential election results, and added, "I want socialism, and i'll not wait for the idiots to finally come round to understanding."
Betts' Twitter profile read, "he/him / anime fan / metalhead / leftist / i'm going to hell and i'm not coming back."
The Twitter page that Heavy says belonged to Betts has been disabled so it's difficult to make an independent judgment. As for the source, in 2017 Will Oremus, writing in the left-leaning online magazine Slate, called Heavy.com "the biggest national news site you've never heard of" and wrote a generally favorable review. According to Mr. Oremus:
It's an outlet that has managed to thrive in a hypercompetitive era by combining some old-school news virtues with a tight strategic focus... the goals Heavy.com seems to strive for are clarity, speed, and ease of reading, with accuracy and comprehensiveness sometimes emerging iteratively as more information comes in.
Readers trying to evaluate the competing claims about Betts may wish to consider a report from a website called Snopes which presents itself as a debunker of contemporary legends. According to Snopes , Heavy.com is correct:
Betts' Twitter bio used the term "leftist" as a personal descriptor... Police have stated that they are "not close at all" to figuring out a motive for the shooting. The specific claim that Betts described himself on social media as a leftist, as pro-Satan, and as an Elizabeth Warren supporter, however, is true.
Even if the reporting by the Heavy and Snopes websites is completely accurate in this case, it doesn't mean that Sen. Warren is responsible, any more than Sen. Bernie Sanders deserved the blame when one of his followers opened fire on Republicans. Before assigning or accepting any blame, Sen. Warren should first seek to find out exactly what happened, and this may not be easy if she satisfies herself with news from friendly media outlets.
Joseph Rago Memorial Fellowship for Excellence in Journalism
Matthew Taylor King named the 2019 recipient of the Joseph Rago Memorial Fellowship for Excellence in Journalism.
Unfortunately tragic events are sometimes distorted as they are used to advance political goals. In a new PragerU video, CNN analyst Steve Cortes makes the case that much of the U.S. media has been misinterpreting and/or misrepresenting Mr. Trump's comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia since 2017.
Here's hoping that in the days ahead news organizations will do more reporting before advocating for a particular legislative response.
***
But You Can Blame Her for This Speaking of Sen. Warren, Americans have reason to be particularly grateful in this campaign season that the U.S. Constitution forbids her plan to tax wealth. Chris Edwards at the Cato Institute notes the many countries, especially in Europe, where citizens without such protections had to learn the hard way about the destructive power of such taxes. Among the many sad experiences cited by Mr. Edwards:
France abolished its wealth tax in 2017 after many news articles noted that wealthy entrepreneurs and celebrities were fleeing the country. The government estimated that "some 10,000 people with 35 billion euros worth of assets left in the past 15 years." A related reform was the 2015 repeal of France's "supertax" on high incomes of 75 percent, which also raised little money and encouraged high-earners to leave...
Germany repealed its wealth tax in 1997 after a constitutional court struck it down due to inequities in the treatment of different asset types. The tax repeal appears to have had a positive effect on savings...
Sweden repealed its wealth tax in 2007 as it became clear that it was driving business people—such as the founder of Ikea, Ingvar Kamprad—out of the country.

In Other News
Fox Butterfield, Is That You? "Compelled to address spiking rates of urban violence in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s or be branded 'soft on crime,' many Democrats joined Republicans in courting the support of police unions, waging a war on drugs and vowing to lock up as many criminals for as long as possible.
"Today, however, violent crime is at historic lows..."

Texto completo: What do most professional women do after they've had a miscarriage early in the pregnancy? Go back to work, seemingly without skipping a beat, often saying nothing about it.
Meghan McCain, a co-host of "The View," recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, revealing that she'd had a miscarriage. At the time, she went back on the air after missing only a few days.
But, she explained, when you're a daily fixture on national television, even a few days' absence is enough to cause rumors. "I am not hiding anymore," she wrote. "My miscarriage was a horrendous experience and I would not wish it upon anyone."
Neither would I. I've had that experience twice.
My first miscarriage took me completely by surprise. My body had always worked like clockwork, and I'd assumed it would efficiently produce a healthy child. But then the technician explained to my husband and me at our first ultrasound that while I had a gestational sac, there was no embryo inside it.
"Lights on, nobody home" is how I couldn't help thinking about it.
It was a traumatic experience, but also oddly isolating. My husband, Bill, of course, was by my side every moment he could be, but he was also struggling with his own reaction and desperate to know that I would be OK. And so I was determined to be OK, whenever he was around. Alone, in my bathtub, was the only time I let myself cry.
I was determined to be OK around everyone else as well. We hadn't told most people that we were pregnant yet; it's a good idea to wait until you're well into the second trimester, and I was only in the beginning of it. Only the people we were close with knew anything had happened at all, and those who did know didn't seem to know what to say. So nobody said much of anything.
I've always been in love with my career, so I returned to that love as the most logical thing to do. A few days after that first miscarriage, I flew to Chicago for a conference. I never considered canceling. I hadn't planned to tell anyone I was pregnant, so it seemed just as easy not to say anything about the miscarriage.
Back home that weekend, Bill's son and daughter-in-law were having a christening for a child of their own. They had started having babies in their 20s. Bill is older than me, and I had married him at 40. That meant we were starting, or attempting to start, our family late in life, when he was already a grandfather.
Being in my 40s added an extra layer of shame to the whole event. It felt like my own fault for having hesitated too long.
It didn't occur to anyone, not even Bill, that I might not want to go celebrate someone else's baby. When I suggested that I stay home, his reaction was enough to convince me that I really couldn't say no. So I put on my prettiest dress and my best smile and went through the whole day acting as though nothing was wrong.
Afterward, I learned that some family members had asked Bill how I was doing. I kind of wish they'd asked me instead. I wouldn't have known what to say, but at least I'd have felt that my miscarriage was a real event, not a ghost occurrence that couldn't even be mentioned.
The second time, after a few more years of trying, the miscarriage came much more quickly. I started spotting less than two weeks after the positive pregnancy test. I'd barely gotten used to the idea that I was having a child when it turned out I wasn't having one after all. By this time I was 45, and I knew I'd lost my last chance to carry a baby to term.
The following week, I headed to New York for yet another conference. For days, I smiled and networked and solved problems and chatted with hundreds of people. Again, I didn't mention that I'd just had a miscarriage.
If I'd managed to have a baby, there would have been a shower and gifts and all the ritual that goes with that. If there had been a death in the family, there would have been another set of rituals to mark that occasion. If I'd had a serious illness, there would have been get-well cards and questions about how I was doing.
For a miscarriage, there is none of that. There is just silence. And an immediate return to what's supposed to be normal life.
McCain equates her miscarriage with losing a baby that she says she'll always love. For myself, I don't quite see it that way. I never felt a kick, or finished picking out a name, or bought a crib, or did any of the things that would make a baby seem truly real. But it was a big loss nonetheless.
Health organizations estimate that there are about one million miscarriages a year in the United States. It's happened to millions and millions of women.
We live in a culture that's good at creating traditions and rituals for nearly every stage of life, from turning 16, to graduation, to a death in the family. Something so common and so devastating deserves to have a ritual of its own. At least, it deserves to be talked about, not met with the bland pretense that nothing at all has happened.
It deserves better than silence.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
OTHERHOOD (2019) Stream on Netflix. A lesson for sons with mothers who expect them to get in touch on Mother's Day: Call, don't text. Otherwise you might set your mother up for the kind of retort Patricia Arquette's character has in this movie when her adult son (played by Jake Hoffman) replies "I texted" to her complaint that he didn't call her on Mother's Day. The line she slams back with? "I birthed you." They're not the only baggage-laden mother-son pairing here; the comedy brings together a trio of moms who journey to New York to reconnect with their children. The film was written and directed by Cindy Chupack, whose past as a writer and executive producer of "Sex and the City" increasingly pokes through as the three women travel from the suburbs to the city. The two other mothers are played by Angela Bassett and Felicity Huffman, whose involvement in the recent college admission scandal may taint this breezy movie.
MUM Stream on BritBox. For more on moms (or one, at least), see this British sitcom. Lesley Manville stars as Cathy, a widow who spent the first two seasons grappling with grief, dealing with bumbling family members and heading more and more clearly toward romance with Michael (Peter Mullan), who was a close friend of her deceased husband. The third and final season, which ran overseas earlier in the year and is now available for audiences in the United States to stream on BritBox, changes the way the show handles time: Where the first two seasons each followed Cathy over many months, the third takes place over the course of a single week. The results received some strong reviews from critics in the show's native country. "Before now, 'Mum' probably made you cry once a year," Jack Seale wrote in a review for The Guardian. "Prepare for that to become three or four times an episode."
NON-FICTION (2019) Stream on Hulu. The French director Olivier Assayas's most recent movie uses the story of two couples to ask questions about the impact of technology on the arts. Its well-off Parisian characters include an editor (Guillaume Canet), an actress (Juliette Binoche) and a novelist (Vincent Macaigne); its big romances are of the extramarital variety. "Either this is a comedy of adultery disguised as a meditation on the future of civilization, or the reverse," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "It's pretty good fun either way, though it's also very much a symptom of the condition it diagnoses, namely the profound complacency of the cultural elite (in France, but of course not only in France)."
What's on TV
THE KLEPTOCRATS (2018) 9 p.m. on Starz. The scandal surrounding the investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad involved the former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak, Hollywood and billions of dollars. This new documentary attempts to untangle it through reporting and interviews with investigative journalists including Louise Story, who covered events surrounding the scandal for The Times.

Texto completo: The more we learn, the more Jeffrey Epstein resembles an evil comic book character for the developmentally arrested intellectual — the charming-but-lurid mastermind with a plot to take over the world by impregnating scores of women on a remote desert estate.
Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the financier/convicted sex offender/philanthropist — and now accused sex trafficker — is also a "transhumanist," who had big plans for humankind. Epstein apparently told one scientist that he hoped to seed the human race with his own DNA by impregnating 20 women at a time at his New Mexico ranch, named "Zorro."
Transhumanism is the theory that the human population can be enhanced through technologies such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering. Or eugenics by any other name. Epstein seems to have believed that he was that rare breed that ought to be replicated.
The carriers of Epstein’s apparently rarefied spermatozoa wouldn’t be the younger, underage sexual partners he allegedly prefers. Instead, according to the Times’ reporting, his maternal vehicles would be adult women whose intellectual qualifications would have been established through academic achievement.
For salon dinners he hosted at his Manhattan manse, Epstein often invited scientists as well as a sampling of attractive, accomplished women. Some of the scientists theorized that the women were being vetted as potential candidates for Epstein’s very special black book, according to the Times.
One can only imagine the conversations at such soirees: So, Penelope, what do you think of transhumanism? Oh, you do? And how do you like the desert air?
The male invitees weren’t your run-of-the-mill scientists but were some of the most renowned, innovative minds in research and academia. Among them was Steven Pinker, the Harvard cognitive psychologist and popular science author, who seems to have seen through Epstein, calling him an "intellectual impostor." Pinker told the Times that Epstein would abruptly shift topics and make juvenile remarks. To the layman’s eye, such behavior suggests a purposeful deflection when the topic at hand is reaching a point beyond the speaker’s comfort range.
Others on Epstein’s guest lists apparently were seduced by his charm and intellect, as well as his wealth, which he reportedly dangled as bait for funding-starved researchers. He was generous, often donating to a variety of interests and causes, including the Clinton Foundation. But he wasn’t convinced that helping the starving masses was productive in the right sense, arguing that providing food and health care to the poor would only heighten the risk of overpopulation.
Pinker, who said he was present when Epstein floated this idea at a gathering at Harvard, dissented, arguing that the evidence points to the contrary. Gods don’t like to be contradicted, and Pinker was thereafter told he’d been "voted off the island" and banished from future gatherings.
Speaking of which, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean — which he dubs "Little St. Jeff’s" — is of renewed interest thanks to an NBC News report last week. Apparently, a blue-and-white striped, block-shaped building on it bears no resemblance to the octagonally shaped design that had been approved for a music hall, according to permit records.
What the structure does resemble, however, is a pharaoh’s headdress. Might this have been intended as a mausoleum for Epstein’s remains? That is, other than his head and penis, which he reportedly wished to have frozen. Also a fan of cryogenics, believing that frozen human parts and bodies could be resurrected in the future, Epstein is no ordinary bloke. Indeed, he is a perversely tragic figure.
Burdened with supra-human fantasies and the means to explore them, it seems that Epstein became lost in his own fable. Wandering the skies in his private jet, enamored of his own mind and image, he forgot that he was merely mortal and may have flown too close to the sun. Confined now to a jail cell (with further punishment perhaps to come) — and removed from his luxurious kingdom, his freedom and the company of luminaries who suffused his ego with admiration — his suffering must be immense.
And so richly deserved.

Texto completo: Among the merits of theater is its ability to respond to social phenomena, often walking the line between art and activism. After the shooting of Michael Brown, Ferguson made the transition from tragic scene to dramatic setting.
In St. Louis, the 2014 incident has at least in part inspired two theater productions: the Black Rep's "Canfield Drive" and the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis' "Until the Flood." Local presentations of "Every 28 Hours," a compilation of one-minute plays, have also explored themes related to racial tension, police injustice and social conflict.
"A lot of artists -- theater artists, musicians, visual artists -- created art that came out of Michael Brown's death," says playwright Kristen Adele Calhoun, who co-wrote "Canfield Drive" with Michael Thomas Walker. "The pieces don't necessarily directly talk about Ferguson or St. Louis, but the impact of his death in the arts world? It's actually hard to measure how far that reaches." "Canfield Drive" is named for the Ferguson street where Brown died.
"Every 28 Hours," a national initiative involving the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, New York's One-Minute Play Festival and St. Louis theater artists, had several local productions in the years following the shooting. Encompassing dozens of 60-second works, and as many artists as needed donating their time, the project was named for an often-cited but disputed statistic regarding the frequency with which a black person is killed by a police officer, security guard or vigilante.
Among the St. Louis organizations involved in presenting the plays were the Black Rep, the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, Shakespeare Festival St. Louis and That Uppity Theatre Company.
"It was definitely a learning experience," says Jacqueline Thompson, an actor, director and University of Missouri-St. Louis theater professor who participated in the project. "It was the first time I'd seen so many different artists partner together -- so many people willing to give their time and energy.
"The role of artists, in general, is to illuminate what's real," Thompson says. "And to shine a light on what needs to happen."
The incident in Ferguson was the impetus behind "Until the Flood," which the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis commissioned for a 2016 production. Written and performed by Dael Orlandersmith, the solo piece -- in which she portrayed multiple characters -- reflected the racial and social dynamics of St. Louis. Orlandersmith has continued with the show beyond the Rep, with the New York Times praising an off-Broadway production last year as "an urgent moral inquest."
Not long after the Ferguson shooting, Seth Gordon, former associate artistic director of the Rep, contacted Orlandersmith in the hope that she might be interested in a commission.
"I had always seen St. Louis as being a particularly segregated town, and one in which race was a huge issue that nobody talked about," Gordon says.
"And now, all of a sudden, everybody was talking about it," he says. "And it occurred to me that the Rep needed to do something -- but needed to do something in a way that wasn't quite as emotionally charged and immediate as a lot of the responses that I was seeing."
Orlandersmith, a 2002 Pulitzer finalist for her play "Yellowman," came up with a theater piece that wasn't specifically about the Michael Brown shooting, but about "a city that was going through this traumatic event and did not know how to talk about it with each other."
A similar approach is taken in "Canfield Drive." Produced in January at the Black Rep, the seriocomic play is largely based on interviews that Walker and Calhoun conducted in Ferguson. Ron Himes, director of the play and producing director of the Black Rep, says that the company "had no choice but to speak to" the tragedy.
"The play really is about social justice, with the Mike Brown shooting as the catalyst," he says.
The incident in Ferguson five years ago remains a prism through which to view a longstanding problem, Calhoun says.
"One of the things that 'Canfield' definitely attempts to do is connect the dots for people," she says. "To say, this isn't just an isolated incident that happened on this street in Ferguson. It's connected to things that have been happening in this country for centuries -- and let's look at those things, so we can understand how we got here."

Texto completo: LANSING – Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appeared to support a change in state law to issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, when she gave an impromptu interview to an immigrants rights organization during the Democratic presidential debates in Detroit.
"We need to ensure that everyone's got a path to getting a license, so they've got identification," Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a video released by the group Movimiento Cosecha after an organizer for the group asked her if she favored issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
"That's something that's important to me, it's important to our economy, and it's important to the people of Michigan."
Michigan passed legislation to ban the practice in 2008 after Attorney General Mike Cox, a Republican, issued a formal opinion in 2007 saying undocumented immigrants could not obtain driver's licenses. Cox's opinion reversed a 1995 opinion from former Attorney General Frank Kelley, a Democrat.
Tiffany Brown, a spokeswoman for Whitmer, would not answer directly Friday morning when asked whether Whitmer favors changing state law to allow undocumented immigrants to hold Michigan driver's licenses. But she did not deny the accuracy of the video and transcript released by Movimiento Cosecha.
"Not sure I'll have much more to add outside of what the governor said in the video about ensuring that undocumented immigrants have a path to getting an ID," Brown said in an email.
She did not specify what that path would look like or whether she was talking about a state identification other than a driver's license. In the video, Whitmer specifically referenced driver's licenses for undocumented immigrants.
A dozen states, including Illinois and California, plus the District of Columbia issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants.
Proponents say allowing undocumented immigrants to hold driver's licenses would help Michigan's economy by making it easier for them work and pay taxes. They say it also would enable them to avoid being detained and deported in many cases, since a major reason for being detained is failing to produce a valid driver's license.
Opponents say the practice raises national security concerns and rewards those who do not observe all immigration requirements at the expense of those who do.
Republicans generally oppose licenses for undocumented immigrants, while Democrats are split on the issue.
In a statement on Twitter Friday, Michigan Senate Republicans said the entire chamber, including then Sen. Whitmer, voted unanimously in 2008 to withhold driver's licenses from "anyone in our state illegally."
"Gov. Whitmer should listen to Sen. Whitmer," the statement said.
Whitmer stepped into the contentious debate at the same time she has counseled Democratic presidential candidates to avoid veering too far to the left and to focus on "dinner table" issues such as wages and education. For example, in an interview with the New York Times, she was critical of instances in the first Democratic debate in Miami when candidates raised their hands to questions such as whether free health care should be provided to undocumented immigrants.
Brown, the governor's spokeswoman, said there is no inconsistency.
"This was simply the governor responding to a question from a constituent," she said.
Whitmer said in the interview with Movimiento Cosecha that Michigan fortunately has a secretary of state and an attorney general who "feel the same way" about the issue that she does.
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson "has met with community leaders and legislators and stands with the governor in support of changing the law so that all individuals working and residing in our state may obtain a state ID or a driver's license for use in Michigan," said spokesman Michael Doyle.
Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, supports issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants, spokeswoman Kelly Rossman-McKinney said Friday.
Members of Movimiento Cosecha were arrested this week when they blocked the entrance to the Detroit-Windsor tunnel in an effort to raise awareness of immigration issues during the Democratic debates.
Dominique Leon Becerra, the group organizer who spoke to and recorded Whitmer, said they plan to make sure the governor follows through.
"No empty promises," she said in a news release. "We need to see real results and a plan to make driver's licenses accessible to our community now!"
The Michigan Catholic Conference has long supported issuing driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants "as a matter of human dignity and the reality that transportation is necessary to get people to the places they need to be," said spokesman David Maluchnik.

Abortion Pills Should Be Everywhere

Texto completo: One afternoon about a year ago, just as the Senate began considering Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, I logged on to Day Night Healthcare, an online pharmacy based in India, and ordered a pack of abortion pills. A few hours later, I got a call from a Day Night customer-service agent with a warning. If my credit-card company called to ask about the purchase, "tell them you approve the charge, but don't say what it's for," the man advised. "If they ask, say it's gym equipment, or something like that."
In fact, the bank never called, and in a week and a half, a small brown envelope -- bearing a postmark not from India but from New Jersey -- arrived in the mail. Inside was a foil blister pack stamped with a manufacturer's logo, dosage information and batch-identification numbers. It contained five pills. One was a 200-milligram dose of mifepristone, better known by its code name during its development in the 1980s, RU-486. The four others were 200 micrograms each of misoprostol, a drug used widely in obstetrics and gynecology, including to induce contractions.
The pills looked unremarkable; tiny, white, round, they did not betray what some abortion-rights advocates say are their epic possibilities. Mifepristone was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration nearly 20 years ago. Used in combination with misoprostol for pregnancies of up to 10 weeks, the pills are more than 97 percent effective.
The drugs, which have been used by tens of millions of women around the world, are also some of the safest known to modern medicine -- mifepristone has accumulated a record of adverse complications lower than that of Tylenol, Flonase, Xanax and Viagra. In 2017, Canadian regulators lifted most restrictions on the drug, allowing it to be prescribed by any doctor, without requiring an ultrasound, and dispensed in any pharmacy.
But in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration has imposed severe limits on mifepristone's distribution. It can be prescribed only by doctors who meet certain qualifications, and can be dispensed only in clinics licensed to provide abortions, not retail pharmacies.
Yet thanks to the digital handiwork of an emerging faction within the global reproductive-rights movement, restrictions on abortion pills are becoming increasingly difficult to enforce. Despite the F.D.A.'s restrictions, activists have created a robust online market that makes getting pills surprisingly easy. There are "report cards" on where to find tested drugs, detailed guides on how to use them safely, a help line for consulting with legal experts, and dozens of discussion boards and support groups helping women navigate the fraught decision of whether and how to terminate a pregnancy.
Amid growing restrictions on clinic-based abortions, the online pill market functions as a haven of last resort for desperate women. "The women who come to us don't have any other alternatives," said Rebecca Gomperts, a Dutch physician and founder of Aid Access, which offers abortion pills online for about $ 90, with discounts for patients in financial straits. "They don't have funds, or they are six hours away from the clinic, or they don't have transport, they have small kids, they live in cars, there are situations of domestic violence -- it's just really bad situations." In 2018, Gomperts prescribed the drug online to 2,581 patients.
But the pills aren't just a way to evade today's restrictions on abortion. Some activists argue that they can also remake tomorrow's politics surrounding abortion -- that the very presence of the underground market could force the authorities to loosen restrictions on abortion pills, eventually paving the way for an alternative vision for terminating a pregnancy in the United States: the inexpensive, safe, very early, private, at-home, picket-line-free, self-managed medical abortion.
"Did you feel a little rush when your pills arrived?" Elisa Wells, a director of the pill-advocacy group Plan C, asked me during a recent phone call. "It's like, wow -- it's amazing that this really works."
She's right: I did feel a little rush when I got my first pills. I'd expected the whole thing to be onerous. And so, probing for hidden difficulties, I tried again, and again.
In the last year, I've ordered abortion pills from four different online pharmacies. The process was sometimes sketchy. There were poorly translated websites and customer-service reps messaging me over Skype with the greeting "yo." I declined to pursue one order because the site asked me to wire money to a random address in India. After I filled out its consultation form, Aid Access sent me an email asking me if I really am pregnant, as I have a man's name and "the woman must confirm" that she is ordering the drugs of her own accord; since I'm a man and not pregnant, I didn't place the order.
But most of my orders came through fine. Each of the three pill packages I got cost me between $ 200 and $ 300, including expedited shipping. (The average cost of an abortion in the United States is about $ 500.)
I spent months looking for a lab that would test my pills; many waved me off, wary of controversy. Finally, I got in touch with Alan Wu, chief of the clinical chemistry laboratory at San Francisco General Hospital, whose lab tested a couple of my mifepristone tablets. The finding: They were authentic. I wasn't surprised; in a more comprehensive study conducted by Gynuity Health and Plan C, published last year in the journal Contraception, researchers in four states ordered abortion pills from 16 different online pharmacies, and found they were all just what they said they were.
Each time I got a pack of pills in the mail, I was increasingly bowled over: If this is so easy, how will they ever stop this? I've been watching digital markets for 20 years, and I've learned to spot a simple, powerful dynamic: When something that is difficult to get offline becomes easy to get online, big changes are afoot.
Which is not to say that everyone is on board with the online market for pills. While there's a growing consensus in the American medical establishment that restrictions on abortion drugs no longer make medical sense, I spoke to several abortion-rights advocates who worried about a parade of horrors that might swamp the movement if the underground online pill market were left to grow unfettered: women getting fake pills, getting ripped off, getting ill, getting slipped pills by men or getting prosecuted.
The activists building the online pill network acknowledge that there are potential dangers in the market -- but they insist that the risks are far smaller than many guess. In a study of more than 1,000 Irish women who obtained pills from Women on Web, a pill-dispensing group Gomperts created in 2005, fewer than 1 percent reported adverse effects requiring further medical attention. "Providing abortions this way is as safe as a clinic-based abortion," Gomperts told me.
For providers and users, legal risk is also relatively low. Regulators have little capacity to enforce restrictions on foreign distributors. In March, the F.D.A. sent a letter to Aid Access demanding that it cease operations immediately. The organization sent a letter back saying, essentially, nope. What happens next is anybody's guess.
Since 2000, at least 21 people have been arrested in the United States for ending a pregnancy or helping someone do so using pills, according to If/When/How, an organization that provides legal assistance to women who self-manage their abortions. That's a tiny fraction of the tens of thousands estimated to have purchased pills online in that time.
For some activists, the specter of stepped-up prosecutions against women who buy abortion drugs is closer to a political gift than a cudgel. "The more we do this, and the more they go after women, the more we show how great the risks are, and how badly women are being treated," Gomperts said.
And the prosecutions might only highlight the compelling evidence that increasing legal access to medical abortion -- that is, abortion-by-pill rather than surgically -- will allow women to have abortions much earlier in pregnancy, which is far more culturally and politically palatable in the United States.
Daniel Grossman, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the University of California, San Francisco, studied the effects of a program in Iowa that allowed women to get abortion pills after consulting with a doctor by video conference. The method proved extremely safe.
What's more, wider access to abortion pills did not increase Iowa's overall abortion rate -- indeed the rate declined, most likely because of a state program that improved access to contraceptives. But the type of abortions shifted: More women had first-trimester abortions, and fewer women had second-trimester abortions. Grossman is working on several other clinical studies focused on the pill, and he says he believes the weight of the evidence will soon become irrefutable.
The pill isn't hard to get now, and it will only get easier.
"It's just a matter of time," Grossman told me.

Texto completo: This is part three in a series of five articles discussing the following case hypothetical from the various professional perspectives:
A and B are getting married. A has two kids from a previous marriage. B has one child from a prior marriage. They plan to have children together. A receives child support from a former spouse. A’s mother also lives with them and helps care for the children. B’s only child works in B’s business and both A and B hope their joint child(ren) will one day join the business as well. A and B have a lot to discuss!
The first thing I would tell A and B about their estate planning is “don’t try to plan for the next 20 years right now.” Trying to plan for too many “what ifs” can cause analysis paralysis. The best practice is to get a plan in place that addresses the “what ifs” of the next three to five years. That’s particularly true for A and B — newlyweds with a newly blended family. That’s why trusts are living documents — they need to be reviewed and adjusted over time as families, circumstances and laws change.
As long as you remain competent and alive, you can amend your trust. And if you don’t, well, you’ve put the right plan in place at the right time.
Currently, there are minor children involved. Were A to pass away, A may want or need to plan for the support and care of the children rather than B, who is likely self-sufficient and not dependent on A’s support at this early stage in their relationship. Later, when A’s children are grown and gone, A is more likely to want or need to provide for B.
B currently has to think about B’s business. In the event of B’s death, B may want to see B’s child carry on the business. If A needs an income stream from B’s estate however, an outright transfer of the business might not work. B’s options would include keeping the business owned by a trust with income paid to A, but with B’s child still running the business and getting a salary. Or, perhaps B can obtain life insurance that would pay to A and allow the business to be transferred to his child.
Life insurance or some other income stream (retirement plans, annuities, etc.) of B are useful here. If A is significantly younger than B, or close in age to B’s child, and B plans to provide for A first, then B’s child, there could be tension. A plan that has a child “waiting around for step-parent to die” can be an invitation to discord (witness the step-parent vs. children disputes of celebrities like Casey Kasem, Robin Williams and Glen Campbell).
If B has a stream of income that can be directed to either B’s child or A with the remaining assets going to the other of them, that can reduce tension. This may give the best hope for a continuing relationship between a child and a step-parent.
In the event of A’s death or incapacity, does the surviving biological parent (e.g. A’s ex-spouse) have custody of the minor children? If so, A may not be able to plan for B’s involvement with the children, but perhaps leaving money in trust with B as the trustee will at least assure some contact and oversight. If not, A will need to carefully consider whether A’s mother or B should be named guardian of the children.
At a minimum, A will want to get powers of attorney and health care directives for minors that allow for A’s mother and B to take care of the children in an emergency, including making health care decisions for the children if A is not able to.
If A and B should die together, who gets what and when requires careful analysis.
A’s children are younger than B’s one child, and if they have additional children in the future, the age gap will be greater. A and B can consider a “common trust” that holds all assets in one trust for the benefit of all children until the youngest child reaches a certain age or graduates from college.
The trustee makes distribution for “health, education, support and maintenance” of all the children, but is not required to do so equally. This gives the youngest child the same advantages as the older children for whom college, a car, perhaps a wedding, was already paid for prior to their parents’ passing.
When the youngest child reaches the stated age, the trust can be divided into shares for the children and distributed outright or over time when each child hits a certain age. The size of those shares is another area for discussion.
Does B’s child get half and A’s children split the other half? If A and B have a child together does that child get a portion of each half? The short-term answer is likely to be much different than the answer 20 years from now.
The decisions to be made will necessarily take into consideration whether there is a large disparity between the assets of A and B, and there are many formulas and approaches to deciding what’s “fair.”
I would say to A and B what I often say to my clients: This may be the first time you’ve had to design your estate plan, but your lawyer has done hundreds if not thousands of plans. No matter how complicated you may think your family is, it’s our job to help you figure out what works for your family, to provide some options for you, and get it all documented.
Then A and B can concentrate on the fun parts of their upcoming Brady Bunch life together. And I’d also say congratulations! And best wishes! And I’ll see you again in three to five years.

Ethiopia plants 350 million trees, and it's just getting started

Texto completo: LONDON - Ethiopia's prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, has been getting his hands dirty this summer, and this week he got much of the nation to join him.
Students, farmers, urban professionals, foreign dignitaries, environmentalists and government officials planted millions of seedlings Monday, in what the government said was the largest one-day tree-planting effort in history.
It was part of Ahmed's campaign to plant 4 billion trees in Ethiopia before the fall to combat deforestation and global warming.
Many schools and government offices were closed for the day, as students and civil servants were urged to take part in the program, which was supported by several international aid groups.
The aim was to put at least 200 million seedlings in the ground a day, and by day's end, government officials said that more than 350 million had been planted.
The figures could not be verified, but they far exceed the previous record. That is held by the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, which in 2016 planted more than 50 million trees in one day, according to Guinness World Records.
On balance, the planet's forests continue to shrink at an alarming rate, but reforestation campaigns have picked up momentum around the world, recognized as a powerful tool to fight climate change, habitat loss and erosion. After losing much of its forest cover, China has set out to be the world leader in expanding it, and most countries have signed onto an array of ambitious tree-planting campaigns.
The Earth Day Network has called for planting 7.8 billion trees on Earth Day next year - one for every living person.
Worldwide, about 900 million hectares of land - almost 3.5 million square miles, nearly the area of the United States - is not being used by people and could support forests, according to a recent study by researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute for Technology, ETH Zurich, that drew intense interest from environmentalists worldwide.
If trees were planted on all of that land, the study said, when they matured they could store about two-thirds of all the carbon that human activity has pumped into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.
In the early 20th century, about one-third of Ethiopia was covered in forests, according to historical estimates, but that had dropped to just 4% by 2000, according to the United Nations. The country's population has soared to more than 100 million people, about five times as many as it had in 1960 - growth that has increased demand for farmland and timber, contributing to deforestation.
From 1990 to 2015, Ethiopia lost 2.6 million hectares of forest, or more than 10,000 square miles, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Agency.
Ethiopia is among the nations taking part in the United Nations' decade-old campaign against deforestation.
Organizations like Farm Africa have been working on management of forests with people in Ethiopia and other countries who depend on them for their livelihoods.
Farm Africa has supported farmers in Bale province in developing forest-compatible trades like beekeeping, producing essential oils and making bamboo furniture, and using fuel-efficient stoves to reduce their dependence on firewood.

Report: Epstein planned to seed human race with his DNA

Texto completo: The New Mexico Attorney General's Office won't say whether it plans to expand its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein after The New York Times reported that the disgraced financier had planned to seed the human race with his DNA from his sprawling New Mexico ranch.
“Our view remains broad; nothing is off the table,” AG spokesman Matthew Baca said Thursday. “We're taking a wide lens on that.”
Baca would not discuss the investigation except to say that the AG's Office will continue to work and be in communication with federal authorities in the Epstein case. He has previously said state authorities were interviewing people who allege they were abused at the New Mexico ranch.
On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Epstein, who is accused of sex trafficking girls as young as 14, had plans to impregnate 20 women at his ranch outside Stanley in order to seed the human race with his DNA. The Times reported that, starting in the early 2000s, Epstein told scientists and businessmen about using the ranch as a base where women would be inseminated with his sperm and give birth to his babies. The article reported that Epstein held lavish dinner parties and dangled financing before the scientific community to further his ideas, citing more than a dozen acquaintances and public documents in its reporting. The Times reported that Epstein's attorneys did not respond to requests for comment on the story.
Despite allegations of sexual misconduct at his New Mexico ranch, Epstein has never faced criminal charges in the state.
In a 2015 court filing reported by the Journal, a woman identified as Jane Doe No. 3 was said to have been frequently sexually abused by Epstein in New Mexico and elsewhere.
FBI and court records obtained by the Miami Herald show that Epstein was “also suspected of trafficking minor girls, often from overseas, for sex parties at his other homes in Manhattan, New Mexico and the Caribbean.”
An address book belonging to Epstein that ended up in court in Florida and was published in full by Gawker in 2015 shows several pages listing contacts for two former New Mexico governors, other prominent community members and about 15 listings under the heading “massage” with first names such as Sabrina, Rachel and Linda and phone numbers with 505 area codes.
Politicians in the state have given back money or otherwise dispersed it after Epstein tried to contribute to their campaigns.
The Manhattan U.S. Attorney is handling the New York case against Epstein, where crimes are alleged in New York and Florida but not in New Mexico.
Epstein's Zorro Ranch has been reported to be 7,500 acres or 10,000 acres. The ranch's most recent assessment indicates a market value of $12.2 million, but Santa Fe County Assessor Gus Martinez has previously told the Journal that because the ranch gets a break for agricultural uses such as running cattle, the actual value could be higher.

La lluvia inundó Richmond Terrace en la costa norte de Staten Island . Más de un conductor de autobús de la Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte informó de las condiciones tal y como apunta un portavoz. El conductor del autobús que se muestra arriba evaluó la situación y decidió que era seguro continuar , según informa The New York Times.
Muchos de los pasajeros del autobús levantaban sus pies para no mojarse, y otros directamente se subían en los asientos , tal y como se puede ver en el video de Lacy Shelby.
“Este es un ejemplo gráfico de los desafíos que enfrentan nuestros operadores de autobuses en la carretera día tras día”, dijo la Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte en un comunicado.

Designer partners get reprise at Target

Texto completo: It started in 1999 with a playful little teapot with a red whistle at the spout.
Some critics wondered if good design would be appreciated by the masses. The teakettle, designed by postmodern architect Michael Graves for Target, didn't immediately fly off the shelves. But it soon became a hot seller, along with other items such as a toilet-bowl brush and a chess set, and the concept of design partnerships took off.
Now Target is celebrating the 20th anniversary of that first collaboration by reissuing iconic pieces from 20 previous partnerships, including Graves, Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer as well as Philippe Starck, Isaac Mizrahi, Anna Sui and Jason Wu.
Others retailers have copied the idea to varying degrees of success. But two decades later, the high-low design collaboration remains one of the hallmarks of Minneapolis-based Target and has cemented its reputation as a purveyor of cheap-chic goods.
Target has done more than 175 collaborations -- some big multiyear ones, others small and for a limited time -- since first linking up with Graves.
Some have been so popular that they crashed its website. Remember Missoni in 2011 or Lilly Pulitzer in 2015?
Others have had a more tepid reception, ending up on the clearance
rack, but still made headlines. Think the partnership with Neiman Marcus that flopped back in 2012.
The anniversary collection, which will hit stores and its website on Sept. 14, will include nearly 300 items priced from $7 to $160, with most items under $50.
The company won't reveal the actual pieces that will be part of the collection for another couple of weeks, to build anticipation. But, reflecting Target's increased focus on inclusivity, the retailer did say the women's clothing pieces will be sold in plus-sizes even if the original partnerships did not come in extended sizes.
Target also has commissioned a book and documentary about its 20 years of democratizing design that will be released this fall.
While these design collaborations were an important ingredient in Target's ascent 20 years ago when they were still more of a novelty, executives and experts alike say they continue to be just as critical, if not more so, to Target today.
"They're these periodic 'wow' moments that are so true to the brand," said Target CEO Brian Cornell. "The reaction it leads to from the guest -- they love those moments. It's a reminder we bring this element of style that's accessible and affordable to guests across the country."
While they're not a big enough piece of Target's overall business to make or break a quarter, he said they help drive awareness of Target, send traffic to its stores and its website, and keep the brand on trend.
Back in 1999 when Target first partnered with Graves, the chain was still adding hundreds of stores and expanding to other parts of the country. It was a $21 billion retailer with 851 stores in 41 states. Its main competitors were Kmart, which was then known for its blue-light specials, and Walmart, which was all about everyday low prices.
The design collaborations helped further distinguish Target from that pack at that time, said Wendy Liebmann, CEO of WSL Strategic Retail.
"They elevated what a big-box mass retailer was all about," she said. "It wasn't only about low prices. It was this notion that even if you are potentially lower income you were worthy of good design. That was a very big statement and a differentiating position for a popular-priced retailer to take in those days."
Today, Target has matured, its growth has slowed and it is opening far fewer stores. It is a $75 billion company with 1,853 stores in all 50 states. But the competition has grown more fierce with more retailers selling many of the same items -- and not just in stores, but also online, led by Amazon, said Liebmann.
"We see in our research how shoppers are willing to buy anything anywhere," she said. "Today, differentiation and expecting more is more important than ever before."
The seeds of Target's first design partnership with Graves were planted, curiously enough, during the restoration of the Washington Monument in the late 1990s.
Target, which had contributed $6 million to the project, asked Graves to design the scaffolding. Graves was 64 years old at the time, a renowned architect and designer who lived in Princeton, N.J., but who had little name recognition outside of certain circles.
A Target executive had told Graves, "We've been knocking you off for years," Graves told the New York Times at the time. "So why not go right to the source?"
That young Target executive, a vice president in home decor, was Ron Johnson, who went on to have a high-profile career as head of Apple's retail stores and a short-lived stint as CEO of J.C. Penney.
The idea of such a partnership wasn't completely new. Kmart had already linked up with Martha Stewart on a line of sheets and towels. But the difference was that Target knew that Graves was a not a celebrity many people would know.
"We don't think we really need to sell Michael as much as we need to sell good design," Johnson told the Star Tribune in 1999, adding that Target's "soon-to-be-affluent" and educated customers would know good design when they saw it.
Graves' initial collection of 150 kitchenware items was so successful that it was soon expanded to more than 500 items. It went on to be one of Target's longest-running design partnerships, sunsetting in 2013, two years before Graves died.
It was followed by other collaborations with designers such as Philippe Starck, who re-imagined baby products; Todd Oldham, who tackled dorm accessories; and Isaac Mizrahi, who offered womenswear.
In later years, Target managed to use up-and-coming designers such as Proenza Schouler, Jason Wu and Joseph Altuzarra before they hit the big time as well as more well-known brands such as Hunter.
These days, most of Target's partnerships tend to be for a limited time. The more popular ones, such as Missoni and Lilly Pulitzer, can lead to such frenzies that stores are mostly sold out within hours. Some items in its most recent collection with Vineyard Vines sold out online within a day.
Over the years, some customers have alleged that Target purposefully keeps inventory low to lead to quick sellouts in order to get more buzz out of them. When that happens, the items often show up soon after on eBay for three to four times the price.
But Target officials have responded that the collections are meant to last weeks and that it's hard to predict demand.
Now that Target in the past few years has refreshed its portfolio of private-label brands, such as its blockbuster kids' clothing line Cat & Jack, the design partnerships also have the added benefit of bringing more attention to its other new in-house brands, said Carol Spieckerman, a retail consultant.
"The overall effect is to freshen up the floor and take away some of the predictability that was beginning to plague Target," she said.
In the meantime, other retailers have pulled off their own celebrated design collaborations. H&M has linked up with the likes of Alexander Wang, Karl Lagerfeld and Versace. Kohl's sells a lower-priced Vera Wang line.
"Other retailers have jumped into the design partnership fray, but Target is still most known for it," Spieckerman said.

Texto completo: “Jackie" director Pablo Larrain is lined up to direct miniseries “Lisey's Story," with Julianne Moore set to star.
Stephen King wrote all eight episodes himself, adapting his 2006 horror-romance novel for the forthcoming Apple TV+ streaming service. The story, which King has called a personal favorite among his books, follows a widow two years after her husband's passing, who gradually begins to uncover startling truths about her husband.
Powerhouse producer J.J. Abrams — who previously teamed with King on Hulu series “11.22.63" and “Castle Rock" — will executive-produce (through his Bad Robot Productions company), as will King and Moore.
Moore confirmed Larrain's involvement to the Globe during an interview for her upcoming drama “After the Wedding."
“I actually wrote [King] a fan letter after I read 'The Stand,' while I was a student in Boston," said Moore, who went to Boston University. “He is unparalleled at combining the drama of everyday life with the supernatural, at the idea that there's this membrane between [them]."
Moore added that she's “thrilled to be working with [the author] and Pablo Larrain, who's a magnificent Chilean director," further confirming that shooting is expected to kick off this fall.
Natalie Portman earned an Oscar nod for playing former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy in “Jackie," Larrain's 2016 English-language debut. “Lisey's Story" is to be the director's first TV project.
Representatives for Larrain and Bad Robot did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Texto completo: The Kennedy family is once again in mourning after the death of Saoirse Kennedy Hill, the granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
The 22-year-old died at the Kennedy compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts Thursday. Her family confirmed her death in a statement to the Associated Press saying, “Our hearts are shattered by the loss of our beloved Saoirse. ”
This isn’t the first time the Kennedys were forced to say goodbye to a family member too soon before their time. The Kennedy family history is marred by events such as plane crashes, World War II combat, alcohol and drug addiction, and various other accidents that have compounded into the so-called “Kennedy curse. ”
Here's a list of some of the Kennedys who faced an untimely death:
Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.
The eldest brother of John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy, he died in a plane crash in August 1944.
The naval pilot was flying off the coast of Normandy, France while serving with the U. S. Navy in World War II.
Joe, who was groomed by his father to be the politician of the family, was just 29 when he died.
He received many posthumous awards including the Air and Navy cross for heroism. The Navy commissioned a Gearing-class destroyer named after him, the USS Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. DD850, which saw action in the Korean War.
Saoirse Kennedy updates: Robert F. Kennedy's granddaughter dies at 22
John F. Kennedy
The 35th president of the United States was assassinated in Dallas in 1963. He was 46. A few hours after the president was fatally shot, police arrested Harvey Lee Oswald and charged him with murder.
As a popular politician, JFK served three terms in the House and then was elected to the U. S. Senate in 1954. He was inaugurated into the White House in 1961 and was the first Catholic president to take office.
He did many things during his short time in the Oval Office such create the Peace Corps and jump-start man's mission to go to the moon at the height of a Cold War with Russia.
Who shot JFK?: 6 conspiracy theories
Robert F. “Bobby” Kennedy
The brother of John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down in Los Angeles in 1968 after winning California's presidential primary against then-Senator Eugene McCarthy and Lyndon B. Johnson’s Vice President Hubert Humphrey.
He started out as a Senate aide to Republican Joe McCarthy and then became a civil rights advocate later in his political career. He served as attorney general in the administration of his brother.
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee only two months before Bobby Kennedy’s death.
John F. Kennedy Jr.
The former president’s son was killed in 1999 when he crashed his airplane into the Atlantic Ocean off Martha’s Vineyard.
His wife Carolyn Bessette, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, were also aboard.

Mary Richardson Kennedy
The wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. died by suicide in 2012.
David Anthony Kennedy
Uncle of Saoirse Kennedy Hill, fourth of Ethel and Robert Kennedy's 11 children.
David Anthony Kennedy struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.
He was found dead in 1984 at a Palm Beach hotel, the Times reported.
The young Kennedy had been in Palm Beach to visit his grandmother and family matriarch, 93-year-old Rose Kennedy.
The Washington Post reported at the time that Sen. Edward "Ted" Kennedy eulogized his nephew during a 50-minute private service.
'Our hearts are shattered' Kennedy family mourns Saoirse Kennedy Hill
Michael Kennedy
Michael Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was killed in a skiing accident during a family outing in Aspen, Colorado in 1998.
A year before his death, he had admitted to an affair with his teenage babysitter and made a public apology, forcing his brother Joseph P. Kennedy II to abandon his run for governor of Massachusetts, the New York Times reported at the time.
Kennedy was the second of the eleven children born to Robert and Ethel Kennedy to die under tragic circumstances, with his brother David dying n Florida in 1984 of a drug overdose.
Edward "Ted" Kennedy
The senator from Massachusetts died at the age of 77 after battling brain cancer in 2009, the same kind of cancer that killed his good friend Sen. John McCain nine years later.
Additionally, last month marked the 50th anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Edward "Ted" Kennedy, then a senator, drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island in Martha's Vineyard. Though he survived, his 28-year-old passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed.
Startling similarities: John McCain dies 9 years to the day after Ted Kennedy — of the same kind of cancer
Saoirse Kennedy Hill
Hill was the only child of Courtney Kennedy Hill, the fifth of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's eleven children. Hill's father is Paul Michael Hill, one of four falsely convicted in the 1974 Irish Republican Army bombings of two pubs.

Gillibrand's Clorox line was a big hit; she honed it on campaign trail

Texto completo: "On the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office, which as a mother, I would do. The second thing I will do is restore our moral leadership on the world stage."
Kirsten Gillibrand
New York senator
Kirsten Gillibrand, the New York senator struggling to gain footing in the 24-person Democratic presidential field, scored what most candidates dream of in a crowded, nationally televised debate: a viral soundbite.
During Wednesday night's Democratic primary debate, CNN's Dana Bash asked Gillibrand about her support for Green New Deal legislation and whether its job-security promises are realistic.
But first, Gillibrand shoehorned in a laugh line that served as a dig at President Donald Trump.
"So the first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand said.
The partisan crowd at Detroit's Fox Theatre erupted in laughter and applause. Gillibrand began trending on Twitter, where thousands of people tweeted the line. Outlets like The New York Times and Marie Claire suggested it was the quote of the night.
Gillibrand had been using the line for weeks For those closely following Gillibrand's campaign, the line wasn't a surprise.
Gillibrand had been using the Clorox quote on the campaign trail for weeks. And it's easy to understand why: It's been a reliable hit among her supporters and those who come out to hear her speak.
Take her talk at the National Urban League Conference in Indianapolis last Friday, when a moderator asked how she would stop the "antics" of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"On the first day that I become president, after I Clorox the Oval Office" —the crowd guffawed and the moderator chuckled — "which as a mother, I would do," Gillibrand said, "the second thing I will do is restore our moral leadership on the world stage."
In a small gathering in New Hampshire early last month, a voter asked Gillibrand how she would repair the United States' reputation in the eyes of world leaders.
"So, after I Clorox the Oval Office," Gillibrand started in response, according to a video from New York Now, a weekly television show.
Again, it got big laughs.
At a Mic town hall in Manhattan on July 22, Gillibrand worked in her reliable line after a question on the Green New Deal, much like she did during the debate.
That time, it only got a few chuckles.
Roots of Clorox line date back months Gillibrand's Clorox line has roots going back at least to February, about a month after she launched an exploratory committee for a presidential run.
At a small gathering Feb. 17 in Keene, New Hampshire, an attendee asked Gillibrand what her first act in the Oval Office would be "after fumigating the White House, of course."
The crowd laughed at the woman's joke before Gillibrand responded, according to a video posted by The Hill.
"Yeah, I was thinking Clorox wipes myself," Gillibrand said to laughs. "I'm a mother. They clean all the handles."
Spokespeople for The Clorox Co. did not immediately return a request for comment Thursday morning.

Texto completo: The Forward Hires New Editor
THE FORWARD ANNOUNCED that it named New York Times senior editor Jodi Rudoren, 48, as its editor-in-chief.
Rudoren was the Times' associate managing editor in charge of audience strategy and previously served as Jerusalem bureau chief, Chicago bureau chief, deputy international editor, education editor and deputy metropolitan editor.
"This is a critical moment for local and identity-based journalism, and a crucial moment in the American Jewish story," Rudoren said. "We need independent reporting, provocative writing and dynamic storytelling that connects people to their Judaism, and we need a platform for civil discourse about all that divides us. I hope The Forward can help forge new models for sustainable, nonprofit newsrooms that put readers at the center of all they do."
The Forward, which dates to 1897, said it reaches 2 million digital readers per month. It discontinued its print issue in March.
Rudoren replaces Jane Eisner, who was laid oif in January when the move to digital was announced.
Orthodox Woman Named to Key NSA Post
Anne Neuberger, who is an Orthodox Jew, will lead the National Security Agency's new Cybersecurity Directorate, effective Oct. 1, JNS.org reported.
Neuberger is a 10-year veteran of the agency and helped found the U.S. Cyber Command. She was the command's chief risk officer and oversaw the agency's security initiative during the 2018 midterm elections.
A resident of Baltimore, Neuberger, 43, grew up in the heavily Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood of Borough Park; she attended Bais Yaakov Jewish day school for girls and later graduated from Touro College in New York and Columbia University's business school.
Sandy Koufax Statue for Dodgers Stadium in 2020
The Los Angeles Dodgers announced that as part of a $100 million renovation project, a statue of legendary Jewish pitcher Sandy Koufax will be added outside Dodgers Stadium, JTA reported.
Koufax's statue will be next to one for fellow Hall of Famer Jackie Robinson in a plaza outside center field. It will be dedicated during the 2020 season.
Koufax - who sat out a World Series game to observe Yom Kippur in 1965 - spent his entire 12-year career with the Dodgers. He won three Cy Young Awards, a Most Valuable Player Award and was named to six All-Star Games.
Boycott Threats Prompt Michigan Restaurateur to Delay Opening
Restaurateur Sam Zahr won't open a branch of Israeli-founded burger chain Burgerim in Dearborn, Michigan, in the wake of boycott threats, JTA reported.
The Lebanese American man said he received threatening messages and his children were bullied, according to the Detroit Free Press.
A boycott, divestment and sanctions movement supporter named Amer Zahr - who is not related to Sam Zahr - has pushed Dearborn's large Arab community to boycott the restaurant.
Sam Zahr said he plans to open Burgerim restaurants in nearby Oak Park and Redford Township and still hopes to open in Dearborn, where he signed a five-year lease.
The first Burgerim location was in Tel Aviv and there are now branches across Israel. The company is headquartered today in California and has franchises in the United States and Europe.

Texto completo: A doctor with dual Saudi-American citizenship who was imprisoned and reportedly tortured in Saudi Arabia for 21 months has been released to his family.
Saudi authorities allowed Dr. Walid Fitaihi to return to his home in Jidda on Wednesday night, sources close to Fitaihi's family told the New York Times. Saudi Arabia held Fitaihi, who earned his license to practice medicine in Boston, for nearly two years for reasons that remain unclear.
The terms of Fitaihi's release are also unclear.
Saudi Arabia arrested Fitaihi amid a crackdown on political opponents and critics of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince's regime is engaged in a large-scale crackdown on intellectuals, politicians, businessmen, and activists, in what the government has billed as an anti-corruption operation.
While most of those arrested during the regime's operation were held for only several months before being released, Fitaihi's sentence lasted much longer. Guards tortured Fitaihi with beatings and electrocution while he was held, according to Fitaihi's son, Ahmed.
Saudi Arabia has denied Ahmed’s account of his father's treatment.

Allyson Felix competes for medals, campaigns for motherhood

Texto completo: About a month after her daughter’s emergency delivery , sprinter Allyson Felix went through one of her toughest workouts – a 30-minute walk.
It was then the six-time Olympic gold medalist realized just how difficult the road ahead would be in her return to track. It was also when she became even more determined to line up for another sort of race: Campaigning for greater maternity protection from sponsors.
She along with other track moms spoke up. Their voices are starting to be heard. Case in point: Felix agreed to a sponsorship deal Wednesday with the women’s apparel company Athleta that offers maternity safeguards and guarantees.
“I totally want to be remembered for having some impact on the sport, having changed things for women of the next generation to not have to feel like they have to choose between a career and motherhood ,” Felix said in a phone interview. “If I could walk away from the sport with some of these issues looking a little different, that’s a win for me.”
Felix was only 32 weeks into her pregnancy when her daughter, Camryn, was delivered on Nov. 28 via emergency C-section after tests showed the baby’s heart rate had dropped to dangerous levels. Camryn weighed in at 3 pounds, 7 ounces.
At the time, Felix was without a contract. She’d been trying to renew her deal with Nike since it ran out in December 2017. She wanted to start a family in ‘18 but was worried about the ramifications.
The 33-year-old Felix explained her situation in a New York Times editorial piece on May 22: Nike wanted to pay her 70% less. Although she was willing to accept a reduction, she wanted assurances around maternity. It was declined.
Alysia Montano and Kara Goucher also spoke out about the need for sponsors to support female competitors before, during and after pregnancy – that contracts shouldn’t penalize someone for starting a family.
In a May 17 statement, Nike wrote: “Last year we standardized our approach across all sports to support our female athletes during pregnancy, but we recognize we can go even further. ... We recognize we can do more and that there is an important opportunity for the sports industry to evolve to support female athletes.”
For Felix, taking an initial stand was daunting. She didn’t know if there would be repercussions.
“I just felt compelled,” she said. “I think it was becoming a mother and knowing that this is a world that my daughter will grow up in and even though it’s uncomfortable and it’s still scary, sometimes you just have to talk about your experiences. When I did I was just overwhelmed with the stories that women shared with me. It just reinforced that it was the right thing to do.”
Athleta brought Felix on board with a wide-ranging partnership deal as she becomes the company’s first sponsored athlete. The partnership includes such things as collaboration on initiatives to empower women and a hand in designing products.
“When you’re supported in that way, you are now a better athlete, you’re a better mother and you’re a better person,” said Felix, who’s still working on obtaining a shoe contract. “It’s already hard enough to be a new mother. It’s extremely difficult to be an athlete. It’s so much better this way.”
The road back to sprinting hasn’t been easy. Felix wasn’t sure if she would even make it back.
She remembered one day in early December being in the newborn intensive care unit with her daughter, who was struggling to breathe.
“I just remember that day just feeling heavy and feeling like I don’t know if I will return,” she said . “I don’t know if it’s still as important to me.”
Her first workout was a simple walk (it was taxing). Her first track practice wasn’t until around March.
Gradually, Felix is rounding back into form.
At the U.S. championships last weekend, she finished sixth in the 400-meter final during her first competition in 13 months. A solid step forward and one that earned her a chance to possibly run in the relay at the world championships in Doha, Qatar, this fall.
She’s on the fence about making the trip if selected. She wants to dedicate her time to training. Her priority is being in top shape a year from now for the Tokyo Games.
Plus, there are plenty of things to do at home – like take her daughter to swim classes. She’s getting the hang of balancing track with motherhood .
“The biggest change has just been not getting as much sleep and feeling exhausted,” she said with a laugh. “But you figure it out and you just find a way.”
Because she wants more moments like this: Her husband handing Camryn to her after finishing the 400 at nationals. Felix is yearning for a similar scene in Tokyo as she tries to make her fifth Olympic team.
“I look forward to hopefully being able to compete there and have her there with me,” Felix said. “That’s the biggest goal right now.”

Will real Midwest please stand up?

Texto completo: CORRECTION PUBLISHED 8/2/2019: This column misstated the cable network on which Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill appeared. It was MSNBC. Minnesota, we hear, is divided into the Midwest and the rest.
Minneapolis, with its bike lanes and its Spoonbridge and its black Muslim congresswoman? Not Midwest.
That's according to a top political editor at the New York Times. And who would know us better than a top political editor at the New York Times?
Jonathan Weisman, deputy editor in the Times' Washington bureau, was arguing on Twitter. His first mistake.
After Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, Part I, former Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill tried to explain to other members of a CNN panel why a proposal like Medicare for All would never play in Peoria.
"Free stuff from the government does not play well in the Midwest, because they are just convinced that they are never the ones getting the free stuff," McCaskill said.
The claim might surprise any farmer who's gotten a subsidy check or any Midwesterner who's had Medicare pick up a hospital bill.
Unless those folks convinced themselves that they worked hard and deserve the leg up from the government, whereas others in the big cities are looking for a government handout so they can blow it all on health care and
spoon bridges.
When progressive activist Waleed Shahid tweeted out that Detroit Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Minneapolis Rep. Ilhan Omar strongly support un-Midwestern Medicare for All, Weisman rendered his verdict.
It was time to clarify which Americans are real Americans, and which issues matter and whose votes count in 2020.
"Saying @RashidaTlaib (D-Detroit) and @IlhanMN (D-Minneapolis) are from the Midwest is like saying @RepLloydDoggett (D-Austin) is from Texas or @repjohnlewis (D-Atlanta) is from the Deep South. C'mon," he tweeted Wednesday morning.
The implication of the since-deleted tweet was that cities with majority-minority populations like Detroit or Atlanta aren't really Real America.
Certainly no Midwestern city would elect someone to Congress who was born in Somalia and wears a hijab.
That doesn't sound like the Midwest at all.
This marks the rudest thing a New York Times journalist has written about Minnesota since they told everyone our signature regional dish was a bowl of grapes mixed with sour cream and sugar.
Minnesota went to considerable effort to rebrand as the Bold North during the Super Bowl and if we're not the North, what are we going to do with all these Askov Finlayson hats?
We didn't even want to be the Midwest.
The Midwest gets defined by what it's not. Not the coast, not the coolest, not everyone's first pick for a summer vacation destination.
But the Midwest is going to pick your next president.
So political reporters will keep flying into flyover country, trying to figure out who that president's going to be.
Some of them seem to have a very specific idea of what a Midwesterner is supposed to look like.
Nobody from Minneapolis, of course. We'll have to check with the New York Times on St. Paul.
They'll want to talk to the farmers, but probably not Hmong farmers in Dakota County. They'll look for factory workers, but maybe not the people on the line at JBS packing plant in Worthington, who work each day in fear of immigration raids.
Minnesota is farms and cabins and reservations and suburbs and skyscrapers linked by skyways. Three-point-six million Minnesotans live in the Twin Cities metro area, 2 million Minnesotans live everywhere else.
Your race, your creed, your orientation, your politics, and your Norwegian grandma don't make you a Minnesotan.
Refusing to take the last bite of a pan of bars in the breakroom makes you a Minnesotan. Complete inability to zipper merge makes you a Minnesotan. Living in Minnesota makes you a Minnesotan. Living in the Midwest makes you a Midwesterner.
Don't let them define us by what we're not.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized President Donald Trump's verbal attacks on Rep. Elijah Cummings and Baltimore, saying that the president should talk to his "slumlord" son-in-law Jared Kushner about conditions affecting residents in the Maryland city.
“The president — this comes as no surprise — really doesn’t know what he’s talking about,” Pelosi, D-Calif. , told reporters Thursday. “But maybe you could ask his son-in-law, who is a slumlord there, if he wants to talk about rodent infestations. ”
Kushner is also a senior adviser to the president.
Trump over the weekend criticized Baltimore as "a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess," and said Cummings, who represents a portion of the city, isn't doing enough to help it.
Trump has repeatedly doubled down on the statements and attacks directed at the African American Democrat and the majority Black city. Many have criticized Trump's remarks as racist but the president denies that they are.
‘Racist words . . . giving me flashbacks. ': Black Cincinnati residents brace for Trump rally following ‘racist’ comments
Donald Trump rallies in Cincinnati: Will the 'send her back' chant reemerge? And will he stop it?
Pelosi was referencing complaints about apartments and townhomes that the Kushner family real estate firm owns in the Baltimore area. Residents in the past have complained of mold, leaks and mice, according to a 2017 investigation by the New York Times and ProPublica.
In 2017, Kushner's firm violated housing codes more than 200 times in just 10 months, according to a release issued by the Baltimore County government. The company only moved to fix the problems after being threatened with fines, the release continued.
More: Those 'rat infested' places in Baltimore? They're owned by Trump's son-in-law
Pelosi has repeatedly pushed back against Trump's characterizations of Baltimore, the city where the Democratic leader was born and raised. Pelosi's father Thomas D’Alesandro Jr. , was a congressman who represented parts of Baltimore and was later elected as mayor of the city.
Pelosi's brother, Thomas J. D’Alesandro III, also later served as mayor of Baltimore.

Thursday, the House speaker continued to defend Cummings as “a pride of Baltimore. "
"To see the president demean a great leader like Elijah Cummings shows his own insecurity and his own lack of understanding about what progress really is," Pelosi said.
"You really have to consider the source," she concluded.

Texto completo: Authorities say they’ve captured the leader of a white supremacist gang who escaped from an Arkansas jail earlier this week.
A spokeswoman for the U. S. attorney’s office in eastern Arkansas says Wesley Gullett was captured Thursday in Pope County in western Arkansas. That’s about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Pine Bluff, which is home to the Jefferson County Detention Center where Gullett and inmate Christopher Sanderson escaped earlier this week.
Spokeswoman Allison Bragg says Gullett was arrested by Dover police, but she did have not any details of what led to the capture.
Sanderson remains at large.
Escaped using 'dummy bodies'
Wesley Gullett and Christopher Sanderson were facing federal charges and being held in Jefferson County jail, located about an hour outside Little Rock, the U. S. Marshals Service said.
Marshals did not know when exactly the escape took place, but became aware around 4:30 a. m. Wednesday, authorities said.
Jefferson County Sheriff Lafayette Woods Jr. told the Pine Bluff Commercial the men escaped using "dummy bodies" in their beds to trick prison guards into thinking they were asleep.
Woods told the newspaper that the men got out using a "vulnerability" in the pod in which they were being held. The pair was able to climb to the roof and then over a fence to escape, Woods said.

Gullett, 30, is a leader of the brutal white supremacist gang New Aryan Empire, according to court records. In February, many members of the gang were indicted in connection with violent crimes tied to the group. Members were also accused of gun and drug crimes.
Gullett was accused of attempted murder. Sanderson, 34, was being held on unrelated federal gun and drug charges.

Woods told the Pine Bluff Commercial that a lack of staffing and the need for renovations likely aided in their escape. The newspaper reported that other inmates tried to escape Tuesday but were stopped when drones saw them on the roof.
According to the New York Times, a $10,000 and $5,000 reward were being offered for information that leads to an arrest of Gullett and Sanderson, respectively.

Texto completo: Headnote To Be Equal
(TriceEdneyWire.com) - "The U.S. "war on drugs" - a decades-long policy of racial and class suppression hidden behind cannabis criminality - has resulted in the arrest, interdiction, and incarceration of a high percentage of Americans of color. The legal cannabis industry represents a great opportunity to help balance the detrimental effects of the war on drugs by creating an equal playing field for all people to benefit from the changing legal landscape." - Minority Cannabis Business Association
It's difficult to overstate how devastating America's racist "War on Drugs" has been for communities of color. Although Black and White people use marijuana at similar rates, Black people have been four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession.
In Michigan, which has already legalized marijuana for recreational use, a 68-year-old man named Michael Thompson is 25 years into a 40-to-60-year sentence stemming from the sale of three pounds of marijuana to an undercover officer.
Last week, Illinois made history when it passed a marijuana legalization law that seeks to atone for the injustice of the War on Drugs.
Illinois' law gives low-income communities of color - the very communities ripped apart by decades of racist drug policies - a fair shot at dispensary and grow-shop licenses. A portion of tax revenue generated by cannabis sales will be directed to investment in those communities through the Restore, Reinvest, and Renew Program.
Under the new law, arrest records for possession of small amounts of marijuana will be expunged automatically, and the board that makes clemency recommendations to the governor will receive a list of everyone convicted of minor possession offenses.
Nearly 800,000 criminal histories could be erased under the law.
We applaud Illinois historic achievement. We stand ready to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the law. We urge other states to follow Illinois' lead when crafting legislation to legalize marijuana by looking comprehensive at redress for past wrongs and creating economic opportunities for communities that bore, and continue to bear, the negative effects of the War on Drugs.
The history of cannabis in the United States - which became known as marijuana in the early 1900s - is fraught with racist hysteria. Following the Mexican Revolution, more than 890,000 Mexican people legally immigrated into the United States between 1910 and 1920. Even though cannabis long had been used in the United States as an ingredient in unregulated "patent medicines," the Spanish term marijuana became associated with fear and prejudice against new immigrants. By 1930, 16 states had outlawed prohibited marijuana as a way to target the growing Mexican community.
In 1971 President Richard M. Nixon launched the "War on Drugs," which was exposed in 2016 by White House Counsel John Ehrlichman as a political ploy to target African Americans and anti-war protestors. Two years after Nixon proclaimed drugs "public enemy number one," presidential hopeful Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New York signed the most draconian drug statues in the nation, setting the sentence for selling two ounces of certain drugs, including cannabis, or possession of four ounces, at a minimum of 15 years to life in prison. The laws have been blamed for tripling New York's prison population.
Even now, as states have begun legalizing recreational marijuana use, recent investigation by the New York Times found that Black people were nearly 15 times more likely than Whites to be arrested in New York City for low-level cannabis crimes.
It's going to take much more than simple legalization to level the playing field - and Illinois' new law recognizes the challenges.
Illinois will waive half of the application fee for license-seekers who are either long-term residents of a "disproportionately impacted area" or who have been incarcerated for a minor pot crime that is eligible for expungement under the bill.
These applicants who receive a license to grow or sell marijuana in Illinois will also be eligible for special low-interest loans from the state, direct grant aid for start-up costs, and other benefits.
As Illinois state Rep. Jehan Gordon-Booth said, "What we are doing here is about reparations. After 40 years of treating entire communities like criminals, here comes this multi-billion-dollar industry, and guess what? Black and brown people have been put at the very center of this policy in a way that no other state has ever done."

Hack highlights cloud security issues

Texto completo: In 2015, Capital One's chief information officer, Rob Alexander, promoted the steps the bank had taken to protect its financial data. In his keynote address at an Amazon Web Services conference, Alexander said Capital One had looked to AWS to meet customer demand, cut back on its data centers and boost security, especially since "the financial services industry attracts some of the worst cyber criminals.
Four years later, Capital One was hacked in one of the largest-ever data breaches of a big financial institution. And in the end, the bank's embrace of cloud services couldn't save roughly 100 million card customers and applicants from having their data compromised.
Instead, federal agents in Seattle arrested 33-year-old Paige Thompson, who is accused of breaking through a misconfigured Capital One firewall. The hole meant a hacker could reach the server where Capital One was storing its information and get into customer data.
Amazon told The New York Times that its cloud had stored the stolen Capital One data. But the bank said that "this type of vulnerability is not specific to the cloud, adding that it was able to quickly diagnose and fix the issue because of its "cloud operating model. Amazon told the Times that it found no evidence that its underlying cloud services were compromised.
Amazon did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
On Monday, the Virginia-based bank said a hacker had accessed roughly 100 million credit card applications. Federal prosecutors say the breach also included 140,000 Social Security numbers and 80,000 bank account numbers, culled from tens of millions of credit card applications. Capital One said the data came from credit card applications that customers and small businesses submitted from 2005 to early 2019. The bank said it expects the cost to the company to range from $100 million to $150 million in the near term.
The hack is one of the most severe to affect the financial services industry. Two years ago, Equifax announced that hackers had stolen the personal information of 147 million people. Last week, the company reached a $700 million settlement with U.S. regulators for that breach.
Capital One has been a leading advocate in the banking world for cloud services. The company is migrating more of its applications and data to the cloud, Bloomberg reported, and plans to be done with its data centers by the end of 2020, in part to reduce costs. Other financial firms have been more wary of cloud services, largely for security reasons.
Cloud-hosting services like AWS are especially attractive to companies looking to cut costs, said Jonathan Stone, chief technology officer for the IT consulting firm Kelser. Building and running data centers carries a hefty price tag, often tens of millions of dollars. But with a third-party service, "you can be an expert in your business and not necessarily have to know how all the plumbing works, Stone said.
But that assurance didn't protect Capital One from its own firewall issue that federal officials say allowed Thompson to break through. Thompson was an AWS employee who last worked at Amazon in 2016, a company spokesman told Bloomberg. The spokesman noted that the breach Capital One described did not require insider knowledge.
Before the hack, Capital One set up an email address for tipsters to raise alarms about potential holes in the company's systems. According to federal prosecutors, the bank received one email suggesting leaked data had shown up on GitHub, a site for collaborating on software code.
The posts linked to her full name, email address and other online records belonging to her, court documents show. Thompson used the online nickname "erratic and openly talked about her hacks, federal prosecutors said.
"I've basically strapped myself with a bomb vest, f---- - dropping capitol ones dox and admitting it, Thompson allegedly wrote under the alias in a June 18 Twitter message.
Stone said that while Capital One missed the firewall vulnerability on its own, the bank moved quickly once it did. That certainly was helped by the fact that the hacker allegedly left key identifying information out in the open, Stone said.
But the hack also raises questions about how companies handle and store historical data, like credit card applications going back more than a decade.
"The more stuff you have laying around, Stone said, "the more chance you have of something bad happening with it.

Texto completo: It started simply enough.

Bon Appétit posted a photo on their Healthyish Instagram account, a vibrant dish of butter beans, heirloom tomatoes and basil. A real chefs kiss recipe idea, perfect for summer.

Only problem: I had no idea what a butter bean was. Or where to get it.

I went to the grocery store. The recipe called for dried beans. The only large, white dry beans I could find were lima beans. They looked suspiciously like the beans in that Instagram photo.

I bought two bags, emptied one into a saucepan, covered the beans with water and let them soak overnight. A couple of hours later, I took a peek. The beans translucent skins had started to slough off, and the still-hard insides were splitting in half.

I Googled.

Are butter beans and lima beans the same thing?

Are dried lima beans supposed to shed their skin?

From thekitchn.com: Lima beans are more than just related to butter beans, they are the same thing.

According to Food52: In the Southern U.S. and in the U.K., these cream-colored beans are named after the dairy product with a similarly rich consistency: butter. Meanwhile, the rest of the bean-eating world labels them limas. Theyre flat and chewy, with a mild flavor and a coloring that ranges from pea-green to off-white.

Wait. Lima beans are the butt of every joke about a disgusting thing your mom forced you to eat as a child. Butter beans are creamy and elegant and tossed with heirloom tomatoes.

And yet.

The next day, I went back to the grocery store and found a can of butter beans. Ingredients: butter beans, water, salt. They were oval-shaped, larger than black or pinto beans, and slightly off-white. Straight from the can, they were bland, tender and rich.

I cooked the dried lima beans. Most of them fell apart or turned to mush in the process, but some remained whole. I placed a couple on the counter next to the canned butter beans. They were indistinguishable. I tasted one. Bland, tender and rich.

I took to Instagram to share my bean findings and immediately got some feedback.

Jen Jacobs, who owns Tampa Bay bakery Wandering Whisk Bakeshop, said she loves butter beans. She has never cooked them, though. Her preferred method of butter bean consumption: finding them in grocery store olive bars. Theyre usually soaked in olive oil, or

mixed with red peppers  perfect for snacking.

She, too, has thought they look a lot like lima beans.

Illene Sofranko, who runs the St. Petersburg-based Urban Canning Company, said lima beans and butter beans were a huge staple for my Appalachian family.

Oh, so theyre different?

They are the same. But theres different varieties! Calling them butter beans is the Southern name. The younger the bean, the greener it is.

That explains why the frozen butter beans I also found at the grocery store were bright green, and much smaller, than their canned white counterparts.

(Plus, Sofranko suggested I order heirloom beans online the next time I want to cook from the dried state, so they hold up better during the cooking process.)

I reached out to the University of Floridas Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Alicia Whidden, a fruit and vegetable horticultural agent in Hillsborough County, was out of the office but responded with a helpful note: Both beans are the same species but lima beans are green and butter beans are traditionally speckled at least until cooked.

I cooked the limas and the butter beans together in the same skillet, with some diced onion and garlic and a fair amount of bacon grease. I added some broth and let them cook down a bit, until they were nice and creamy. Whatever they were called, they were delicious.
TRY THESE AT HOME

Butter beans can be a powerful tool in your cooking arsenal. Plump and creamy when fully cooked, they do in fact have a butterlike texture that is very appealing. Butter beans don't have a ton of flavor, so they're best when pumped up with some fat, particularly bacon or ham. Their creaminess also means they blend well, making bean dips or spreads a breeze.
EASY

Pan-Fried Butter Beans

3 tablespoons olive oil 1 (15-ounce) can butter beans, drained, rinsed and patted dry 2 cloves garlic, peeled and bruised, or more to taste 2 sprigs fresh rosemary 1 pinch red pepper flakes,or more to taste Salt and ground black pepper to taste 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Cook and stir beans into hot oil until slightly golden and crispy, about 10 minutes. Stir garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, salt and black pepper into beans; continue cooking for about 5 minutes. Drizzle vinegar over beans and toss.

EASY

Beans on Toast

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing 3 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 medium white or yellow onion, finely chopped 1 medium carrot, peeled and finely chopped 1 medium stalk celery, finely chopped 1 pound dried heirloom beans, picked over and rinsed 2 teaspoons kosher salt 8 large slices crusty bread,cut ½ inch thick 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened Flaky sea salt and ground black pepper Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until it shimmers. Add the garlic, onion, carrot and celery and cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are soft and fragrant but not browned, about 8 minutes.

Add the beans and enough water to cover by about 2 inches. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil; cook for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to a very gentle simmer (bubbles just barely breaking the surface), partly cover and cook until the pot stops smelling like the aromatics and starts smelling like the

beans, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Add more water if necessary to keep the beans fully submerged. Gently stir in kosher salt and continue cooking until the beans are creamy in texture but not bursting, 10 to 45 minutes more.

Drain the beans, reserving the tasty cooking liquid for another purpose, such as a base for soup or a vehicle for egg poaching. You can store leftover beans in their cooking liquid in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Toast the bread and then butter each piece. Spoon about ½ cup beans onto each piece of toast and coarsely crush with a fork. Divide the remaining whole beans among the toasts (about ¼ cup per toast). Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and pepper to taste.

Makes 8 pieces of toast.

EASY

Ham and Butter Beans

1 tablespoon bacon grease or butter ½ cup diced onion ¼ cup diced carrot 3 cloves minced garlic 1 cup chopped smoked ham 1 (15-ounce) can butter beans, drained and rinsed 1 cup chicken broth Kosher salt Black pepper 1 teaspoon garlic powder ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes Heat bacon grease or butter over medium heat.

(I cooked a couple of pieces of bacon in the skillet, then removed and used them for another purpose and left the grease behind.) Add onion, carrots and garlic and saute until soft, about 3 to 5 minutes.

Add ham and beans and cook for about 5 minutes or so until ham and beans have some color on them.

Add chicken broth ½ cup at a time, stirring well after each ½ cup, then season with salt and black pepper to taste, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.

Bring to a low boil and reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until most but not all of the liquid has evaporated. Serve.

Serves 2.

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — With the first round of the second Democratic debate over, here are some reactions from across the board.
Atlantic writer Emma Green wrote that Democrats are focusing on the difference of morality between them and President Trump.

- "The great irony of Donald Trump’s presidency is the dizzying contradiction between his personal conduct and his policies, and his claim to be the defender of American values. Onstage at the first part of the second Democratic presidential primary debates tonight, Trump’s potential 2020 opponents moved aggressively to take morality back for their team."

Sen. Mitt Romney criticized Sen. Bernie Sanders for his lack of success in bringing his proposals to fruition.

NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben noted that one of the biggest issues of the debate was health insurance and health care.

- "This exchange encapsulated one of the biggest arguments in tonight's debate over health care: whether candidates would raise taxes, and whether families' total health care bills would go up."

Fox News contributor Douglas Schoen commented on the divide of the far-left candidates, Sen. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and other moderate candidates.

- "A clear divide emerged between Warren and Sanders on the far left and the more moderate candidates, with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota standing out."


The New York Times opinion columnist Frank Bruni noted how the other candidates targeted Sanders and Warren for their far left ideas.

- "So they did, portraying Sanders and Warren as fantasists peddling policies — single-payer health care, the decriminalization of illegal border crossings, the elimination of all or most college debt — that were poorly conceived pipe dreams and, worse yet, recipes for President Trump’s re-election."


Edward-Isaac Dovere , writer for The Atlantic, wrote that Democratic voters and presidential candidates worry that they might not win against Trump in 2020.

- "Democratic voters have become pundits in this primary, constantly worrying about who they think can beat Donald Trump and who they think everyone else thinks can beat Donald Trump. In last night’s debate, the candidates became pundits too. Two-and-a-half years after Election Night 2016, and a year and a half until Election Night 2020, Democrats are still clearly, desperately, viscerally afraid none of them will win."

Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that the winner of this debate was Donald Trump.

- "It was a really good night for Donald Trump. He could hardly have hoped for a better debate."

Texto completo: Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is offering to buy Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar a plane ticket to visit her home country of Somalia to learn to be more grateful for living in the United States.
Omar is one of four congresswomen – known as "The Squad" – who President Donald Trump told to "go back" to their ancestors' countries instead of criticizing U.S. policies.
A few days later, Trump held a campaign rally in North Carolina where the crowd chanted "send her back" when the president spoke of Omar, a Somalian refugee who came to the U.S. as a child.
Trump condemned the chant when later asked by reporters but then called those who attended the rally "patriots" in subsequent comments.
"I'm not saying we forcibly send her anywhere," Paul said in an interview last week with Breitbart News, a conservative-leaning outlet. "I'm willing to contribute to buy her a ticket to go visit Somalia. I think she can look and maybe learn a little bit about the disaster that is Somalia."
The Kentucky Republican then criticized the East African country for having "no capitalism" or "God-given rights" under a constitution. He said Omar "might come back and appreciate America more" after visiting Somalia.
An Omar spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. But her campaign account did retweet messages criticizing Paul, including comedian Tom Arnold who made fun of the senator being assaulted by his neighbor in 2017.
Paul's comments did draw a rebuke from a member of Kentucky's federal delegation, Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville, who defended his Democratic colleague.
"Continued efforts to paint Congresswoman Ilhan Omar as anything less than a proud American are offensive to say the least," Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, told the Courier Journal. "It's safe to say that Ilhan understands Somalia a lot better than Rand, and he'd be better suited just keeping quiet than making foolish and condescending remarks like this one."
Omar, who emigrated to the U.S. in 1992, said in a recent op-ed to the New York Times that the "send her back" chant "will be a defining moment in American history." She added that this marks a "fight for the soul of our nation."
"Throughout history, demagogues have used state power to target minority communities and political enemies, often culminating in state violence," Omar said in the op-ed. "Today, we face that threat in our own country, where the president of the United States is using the influence of our highest office to mount racist attacks on communities across the land."
Paul, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, has defended the president against charges of racism in the past.
A year ago, when Trump reportedly referred to African nations as "s---hole countries" Kentucky's junior senator said the comments weren't constructive, but that it was "unfair" to label the president a racist.
Paul has a budding relationship with the president and was recently tapped to help with negotiations with Iran. He has defended Trump over the tweets aimed at the congresswomen, which include Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York; Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
The senator told Breitbart that in the city of Bowling Green, where he lives, there are many immigrants and refugees who are great citizens, but that those people are thankful to be in America.
"Then I hear Rep. Omar say, 'Oh, America is a terrible place, there is no justice here,' " Paul said. "Well, she came here and we fed her, we clothed her, she got welfare, she got school, she got healthcare, and then, lo and behold, she has the honor of actually winning a seat in Congress, and she says we're a terrible country? I think that's about as ungrateful as you can get."
Sergio Gor, a spokesman in the senator's office, declined to comment for this story.
Some of Paul's supporters contacted the Courier Journal to cheer the senator's remarks aimed at Omar. One reader, identified as Dave Stark, said if the congresswoman or anyone, "doesn't like living in the U.S." they should leave the country.
"Nobody needs you here," he said.
Another Paul supporter, Joe Cavagnaro, said in an email that Omar is a "socialist bigmouth" who is dangerously out of touch with the rest of the country.
"She really should go back to her s---hole country of origin," he said. "Not a comment as to her race but rather her politics. The Squad is out of touch with mainstream America and needs to be voted out of office ASAP. You must get rid of the cancer before it spreads too far!!"
But Paul was also condemned for the comments by several others, mostly on Twitter.
Democratic strategist Dante Atkins said Paul, who is a libertarian-leaning senator, "would love Somalia."
"No central government, total lack of regulatory infrastructure, and an unlimited right to keep and bear arms," Atkins tweeted. "He should check it out. Libertarian paradise."

IS SHE ONE OF AMERICA'S WORST COOKS?

Texto completo: Mercedes Manda concedes she's a pretty lousy cook.
Every cash-strapped college student knows how to prepare a package of instant ramen, right? (Boil water, add seasoning pack, stir in noodles.) Not Ms. Manda.
The Duquesne University communications major once burned them, because she forgot water goes in the pan before the noodles.
She also has been known to serve eggs slathered with jelly to her roommates for dinner, has tried (and failed) to make cheesecake in a blender, and God help the 20-year-old - who friends call Sadie - should she decide to whip up pancakes.
"I literally can't do it," she says.
But still. Do those culinary transgressions, and many more, make her one of the worst cooks in America?
Audiences across the U.S. will soon find out, when the latest season of Food Network's "Worst Cooks in America" kicks off on Sunday.
Now in its 17th season, the show pits two teams of terrible cooks like Ms. Manda against one another in a boot camp-like culinary competition designed not to throw shade, as the title implies, but to teach them how to become better cooks.
One team is led by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, while the other takes it cues from chef Anne Burrell, who's known for her spiky platinum blond hairdo and whose first cookbook, "Cook Like a Rock Star," earned her a spot on The New York Times bestseller list.
Over the course of the eight-week season, the contestants learn everything from how to use a knife and properly season food, to how to filet a whole fish and make perfect fried chicken. Unless they're one of the two cooks eliminated each week, that is, for preparing the week's worst dish.
The cook who makes it to the season finale on Sept. 22 and wins the cook-off - in this case, a three-course, restaurant-quality meal judged by three food critics - walks away with a $25,000 grand prize and, ostensibly, seriously improved cooking skills.
Ms. Manda isn't exactly sure who filled out the questionnaire that led her to becoming one of this season's 14 recruits; it was sent in as a joke after a family party last December during which a commercial seeking contestants for the show flashed across the TV screen.
So, when a producer called a few weeks later, she was shocked. Actually, amused, is more like it, she says. "I thought, 'How the heck does that happen?'"
Several more interviews followed, during which her seven roommates in Oakland kept egging her on. Before she knew it, a producer was asking her to send in a tape of her cooking something outside of her comfort zone. She chose pizza from scratch.
The recipe instructed her to sprinkle cornmeal on the baking pan so that the dough wouldn't stick while cooking.
"But I didn't know what that was," she says, laughing. "So I used oatmeal instead."
What most would view as a total disaster actually made her shine to the show's producers.
A month later, Ms. Manda got the call. She'd been cast, with filming in New York City at the beginning of March.
"I was like, 'For real?'" she recalls, adding, "It sounded really fun and a great opportunity to learn to cook."
Ms. Manda is the youngest of a cast that also includes a professional opera singer, a minister, a former Arizona Cardinal turned actor, a professional hypnotist and Miss Pennsylvania 2011.
She concedes it was kind of weird to have so many cameras trained on her as she cooked, but both Mr. Flay and Ms. Burrell, along with the crew, made it fun.
"They walk the line of not tearing people down or making fun of them," she says. "And I could tell they really wanted to teach us how to cook."
As for her family? They think it's the funniest thing ever, and they can't wait to watch Sunday's premiere during their beach vacation at North Myrtle Beach.
Mum's the word on whether Ms. Manda makes it past the first episode. What she will say is that viewers will enjoy the show's lighthearted energy and maybe even learn something from her and the other contestants' bad cooking.
"It's a cool way to connect with people," she says.

Latino busca explicación médica por haber olvidado a sus gemelos, muertos de calor en su auto en NYC

Texto completo: Juan Rodríguez (39) sobrevivió a la guerra de Irak, pero nada se compara con la pesadilla que está viviendo desde la tarde del viernes, cuando descubrió que un “descuido” suyo había acabado con la vida de sus gemelos de un año de edad, asados de calor tras ser olvidados dentro de su auto en el estacionamiento del hospital donde trabaja en El Bronx (NYC).
Desde entonces Rodríguez ha estado tratando de comprender cómo pudo dejado a su hijo mayor de 4 años en su guardería y haber olvidado hacer lo propio con los gemelos en su otro centro de cuidado. Y, peor aún, cómo pasó 8 horas en el trabajo sin recordar que los bebés estaban encerrados en su auto.
Algunos se preguntan si esa “laguna mental” no es consecuencia de su experiencia militar. De hecho, en el Hospital “James J. Peters VA” en Kingsbridge labora como trabajador social ayudando a otros ex combatientes sin hogar y enfermos.
El sábado quedó en libertad bajo fianza, con cargos de homicidio involuntario.
Angustiado, le dijo a un amigo cercano que creía que había dejado a los niños en su guardería, a pesar de que no lo había hecho. “No podía explicarlo”, dijo el amigo Alfredo Angueira. “En su mente los dejó”.
El domingo, Rodríguez llamó a David Diamond, un profesor de psicología en Florida que estudia por qué los padres pueden olvidar a sus hijos en los automóviles.
Rodríguez no podía entender su propio lapso de memoria. “Pensó que era la única persona que había hecho” algo así, dijo el Dr. Diamond en una entrevista a The New York Times.
El Dr. Diamond le aclaró a Rodríguez que cientos de otros padres también han dejado a sus hijos en autos calientes, con resultados igualmente trágicos. Le ha sucedido a médicos, contadores, maestros.
Desde 1998, alrededor de 440 niños en todo el país han muerto de golpes de calor después de ser olvidados en automóviles, generalmente no por falta de amor, sino por cómo funciona la memoria humana, dijo Diamond.
“Creo que esto lo ha ayudado en su momento de duelo”, dijo, “para comprender cómo es posible que pudo haber hecho eso”.
Rodríguez no ha hablado públicamente, pero los comentarios de Angueira y el Dr. Diamond ofrecieron las primeras ideas sobre cómo está lidiando con la devastadora realidad de haber dejado morir a sus hijos.
Rodríguez, quien vive en el condado Rockland (NY), al salir del trabajo regresó al auto a las 4 p.m. Sólo se dio cuenta de que los bebés estaban dentro después de que comenzó a manejar unas cuadras, afirmó.
“¡Mis bebés están muertos! ¡Maté a mis bebés!”, gritó al descubrirlos muertos y con espuma en la boca .
Su esposa, Marissa A. Rodríguez ha estado a su lado, afirmando que fue un accidente horrible. El domingo dijo en un comunicado que las muertes de sus bebés Luna y Phoenix han sido “mi peor pesadilla”.

Venturing into life's great unknowns

Texto completo: I like people who admit that not only do they not know all the answers, they don't even know the questions. (Alas, a glib newspaper columnist is not one of these people.) A concept that takes this further is that of the "unknown unknowns."
Sounds like gobbledygook? Bear with me.
Donald Rumsfeld used the phrase in a state department briefing about terrorism in 2002. (Please don't get your knickers in a twist if you don't like Rumsfeld - the concept itself is apolitical.) He said there are "known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there also are unknown unknowns - the ones we don't know we don't know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones."
I am willing to bet that in your life, the dreadful thing you never even thought of to worry about was the one that brought you to your knees.
The concept of unknown unknowns applies to everything from personality types to urban planning. The know-it-all who doesn't know how much he doesn't know is a staple of comedy from "Falstaff" - a trickster who gets tricked - in Shakespeare's "The Merry Wives of Windsor" to Barney Fife in "The Andy Griffith Show." (Remember the scene where Barney, lecturing a group of kids on the perils of crime, accidentally locks himself in a jail cell?)
This concept is reversed in characters who don't know what they do know - for instance, Betty White's Rose Nylund character on "The Golden Girls" and Edith Bunker in "All in the Family." When daughter Gloria asks Edith why she married Archie instead of her former boyfriend Freddie Witthauser, Edith answers, "Well, I liked being called a 'Goddess of Beauty,' but somehow it seemed more permanent when your father called me a dingbat."
And, Forrest Gump solved the existentialist's dilemma by saying, "I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we're all floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it's both."
Funny that these intuitives are either women who appear to be ditsy or men who are "not quite right," like the philosophical Jimmy Stewart character in the movie "Harvey," whose companion is an invisible 6-foot-tall rabbit. He tells the psychiatrist who is trying to cure him, "Doctor, I've wrestled with reality for 40 years and I'm happy to say that I've finally won out over it."
On a serious note, the unknown unknowns always are at risk in city planning, where the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.
An example is Toronto, where I frequently visit and which has the fourth largest population in North America. Clean, friendly and attractive to immigrants, its population growth has strained the city's limited taxation powers.
Starchitect (star architect) Jack Diamond pointed out this flaw in a 2018 article in The Globe and Mail: "The lowest-income cohort has expanded and has been displaced by economics to the urban periphery, where social services and transportation are least available; the highest-income cohort has increased and is consolidated primarily in the city centre; and the middle-income group has shrunk and now lies between the highest- and lowest-income groups."
In other words, it's three rings around the rosy - rich in the middle, middle income at the edge, poor at the outer edge - with a risk that all will fall down. As Diamond concludes, that's a problem that a ferris wheel on the water can't fix.
If you'd like to know more about how much you don't know, here's a link to a terrific series in the New York Times by Errol Morris: "The Anosognosic's Dilemma: Something's Wrong But You'll Never Know What It Is," tinyurl.com/23a6pw6.

Texto completo: The state agency overseeing Wisconsin's for-profit colleges is building up its watchdog role after a transition nearly two years ago led to an exodus of experienced employees, prolonged vacancies and no spending authority to fill key positions.
The Republican-controlled Legislature and former Gov. Scott Walker eliminated the Educational Approval Board in September 2017, shifting oversight to the Educational Approval Program under the state Department of Safety and Professional Services.
The independent board built a reputation for policing predatory tactics used by some for-profit schools, according to the board's former executive director.
Republicans, however, said eliminating the board would decrease the regulatory and fiscal burden on for-profit schools.
The Legislature included language in the 2017-19 budget that would have guaranteed board staff stay in their jobs once DSPS took over, but Walker vetoed the condition, saying the department needed flexibility in its staffing decisions. His admin-istration said during the transition that the same number of employees, 6.5 full-time equivalent positions, would be employed under DSPS and assume all responsibilities the board previously oversaw. When Dawn Crim, Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' pick for DSPS secretary, took over the agency in January, she learned the program had four employees and the agency lacked the spending authority to fill vacancies that had been left empty since the transition. And just one of the four employees previously worked for the board.
"So much of the institutional knowledge walked out the door," Crim told the Wisconsin State Journal. "We're working to bolster the infrastructure and relationships lost during the transition."
Lots of debt, no degree
The small board staff oversaw more than 200 private post-secondary schools, including for-profit colleges in Wisconsin or out-of-state non-profits offering online programs in the state. More than 46,000 students were enrolled at those schools.
For-profit college chains often rely on a strategy of intense advertising with misleading information on job placements and program offerings, according to federal court records and complaints filed with state and federal agencies.
TV commercials promoting the ease of enrolling at ITT Technical Institute lured Travis Higgins to the Rimrock Road campus in the summer of 2009. He said he looked at other schools, including Madison Area Technical College, but the application process was more cumbersome.
ITT Tech staff secured a student loan for Higgins within 30 minutes of his visit to the office, he said.
"They didn't explain any of the terms to me," he said. "All (ITT Tech) said was, 'Let's get you signed up.'" Higgins said he studied criminal justice with plans to transfer to a tech school or University of Wisconsin System campus, but he learned his credits wouldn't transfer. With $24,000 in debt already accumulated, he dropped out in the winter of 2010.
An ITT Tech official then flooded Higgins' phone with messages urging him to re-enroll, he said.
The school, which opened the Madison branch in 2008, filed for bankruptcy in 2016 after several investigations were opened amid the U.S. Department of Education restricting the institution's access to federal student aid.
ITT Tech said in a statement at the time of its closure that the federal government's actions were unconstitutional and that it had "worked tirelessly to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations."
Higgins now works at a manufacturing job out of state. He says he still has about $10,000 to pay off nearly a decade after he left without a degree.
National reputation
Wisconsin used to be a leader in for-profit college regulation, according to former Educational Approval Board executive director David Dies.
The state was one of the first to regulate distance learning, he said. The board's approval process for schools coming into Wisconsin prompted other states to reach out for guidance.
Dies spent more than 15 years at the EAB and said he was not invited to interview with the agency that absorbed the board's responsibilities.
The board's relationships with other states and national organizations were key to its oversight, he said.
Communicating with others tracking changes of schools elsewhere pointed Wisconsin toward warning signs of an institution on the verge of closing, such as staff members' contact information disappearing from a website.
The board worked ahead of pending closures, requesting students' transcripts while there was still access, formulating transfer options for students and discussing loan protections with them.
About 2,300 Wisconsin students were affected by school closures in 2016 alone, according to the board.
"I don't know what the capacity of (the Educational Approval Program) is to handle a catastrophic closure today," Dies said.
Crim acknowledged limited resources have made the program more reactive than proactive, but said student protection remains the agency's top priority. Rep. Dave Murphy, R-Greenville, who leads the Assembly Committee on Colleges and Universities, sees the transition a bit differently.
"I don't think (the transition) hurt the state so far, but I think it's a fair question going forward to say, 'Might we need to do something differently?'" he said in an interview.
He points to EAB's own data that show the number of for-profit schools operating in Wisconsin declining in recent years, though he also acknowledged student enrollment in those types of schools are tied to the economy and increase during recessionary periods.
The Republican-controlled Legislature's two leaders, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, and Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, respectively declined to comment and did not respond to interview requests.
Sen. Dale Kooyenga, R-Brookfield, who leads the Senate Committee on Universities, also declined to comment. Aide Patrick McNulty said Kooyenga may be interested in talking about a specific bill as opposed to a general topic.
Vacancies
For about two decades, the board produced reports that included information on schools and enrollment and, in recent years, on program-level data and student results.
"In 2016 and 2017, we were really hitting our stride with information (in the reports)," Dies said. "It wasn't just helpful to prospective students, so they can make an informed decision on which institution they may be interested in attending, but also looked at what their chance of success may be. And institutions themselves found the information useful to measure themselves against."
No report has been produced since the board dissolved, DSPS deputy secretary Dan Hereth said. One of the program positions left vacant for more than a year was the analyst who produced the reports.
And it's unclear where previous reports are housed. They appear to have been lost in the transition, so future analysis comparing to previous years will be more difficult.
Hereth was able to track down from another agency the most recent report completed in June 2017, just months before the transition. It found an average dropout rate of 42% and an average completion rate of 37% among four cohorts of students over a four-year period.
The program received spending authority in the 2019-21 budget passed earlier this month to fill the two positions that had been vacant since the transition, Crim said. Searches to fill those positions will start soon.
Program staff in the future would like to more closely mon-itor school advertising and promotional materials for misleading claims, restore outcomes data analysis, establish standards for student retention and completion rates, and re-cultivate relationships with outside groups.
Federal rules relaxed
The rebuilding of the program comes amid the Trump admin-istration rolling back regulations imposed under President Obama that increased federal scrutiny of for-profit colleges.
For example, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos issued earlier this month the final repeal of a rule aimed at holding low-quality education programs accountable by forcing them to prove their graduates were able to repay their student debt.
The Education Department said the rule created a considerable reporting burden on schools "and, in turn, costs to students."
The repeal takes effect July 1, 2020.
Under DeVos, the department has dismantled its unit that investigates widespread abuses by for-profit colleges. A department spokeswoman told The New York Times the group was disbanded through attrition.
Dan Zibel, who worked at the U.S. Education Department under the Obama administration, now serves as chief counsel for the National Student Legal Defense Network, a national advocacy organization focused on consumer protection in higher education. He said the burden shifts to states when the federal government fails to take seriously its role in protecting students.
"Higher education has long been focused on this notion of the triad, which is the Department of Education, accrediting agencies, and states," Zibel said. "When one member of the triad is basically saying, 'We're not going to be looking at issues,' it certainly falls to the others to pick up the slack, and states are really best positioned to be doing that."

Texto completo: Since the 2015 cast recording of the teen angst rock musical "Be More Chill" has been streamed more than 300 million times, it's safe to say that there might be some die-hard fans out there. This month, not only can they catch the updated show on Broadway for as much as $165, but motivated buffs can also see the original 2015 script and songs performed at the 70-seat Monumental Theatre in Alexandria, Virginia, where the top ticket goes for a reasonable $40.
"The 1.0 being performed does not negate the Broadway version, and vice versa," says "Be More Chill" composer Joe Iconis, a musical theater fanatic who grew up arguing happily about different versions of favorite shows like "Cabaret." "I love the idea of somebody going to both and saying, 'I prefer the 1.0 version.' It's all in play."
As new musicals try to fully exploit their commercial potential on Broadway, rights to professional and amateur productions around the country are typically closely guarded. Since "Be More Chill" only hit the Lyceum Theatre in New York this past March after a brief off-Broadway run last summer, Monumental co-artistic director Jimmy Mavrikes says his friends had one question for him as the modestly budgeted production opened last week: "Are you doing this legally?"
"It's unusual for most shows," says Iconis, whose catchy songs have been internet catnip since the album release that gradually blew up after the musical's brief debut at New Jersey's Two River Theater. "But I think for 'Be More Chill,' it's in line with how the show has developed and operated from the beginning. The show is on Broadway because actual human beings loved it."
"Be More Chill" is based on the 2004 novel by Ned Vizzini (who took his life in 2013) and deals with an anxious outsider named Jeremy, made "chill" by taking a Japanese-engineered computer-pill called a Super Quantum Unit Intel Processor (SQUIP). The musical's song "Michael in the Bathroom" was a highlight at last month's Tony Awards, as host James Corden made an in-joke of nervously hiding in the bathroom and finding last year's still-fretful hosts, Sara Bareilles and Josh Groban, in there, too.
Two River commissioned and premiered the musical, then teamed up with Ghostlight Records to record the score. That was a first for the troupe, according to managing director Michael Hurst, who says the company produced the show and the album without "enhancement money" from commercial producers. (Ghostlight released the new Broadway cast album Friday.) "Michael in the Bathroom" was the song that came up on Mavrikes's Spotify list two years ago, right after he told director Izzy Smelkinson that, no, he had never heard of a musical called "Be More Chill." The tune caught his ear, and so did the kid-focused story and the accessible pop score.
"We are interested in appealing to younger people than we've gotten before," says Mavrikes, describing the company's focus as "millennial theater, trickling down to Generation Z." "And the show is about growing up and figuring yourself out."
Co-artistic director Michael Windsor liked that "Chill" is "genuinely" about teens - "about social anxiety and how to fit into this weird high school world."
The rights were becoming available. Iconis says that after a discouraging New York Times review of the Two River staging, "The show very much felt like it was dead in terms of any kind of commercial production." But videos of two songs that Two River created from B-roll footage joined a growing throng of homemade "Be More Chill" performances online, and when Exit 82 staged the first amateur production late in 2017, fans flocked to Lakewood, New Jersey, from all over.
"Many popular lines from 'Be More Chill' were met with cheers and screams from the audience," one reviewer blogged of the weekend run.
"At that point we knew the show had a worldwide fan base," says Hurst.
"This was embraced, and part of it was people doing their own versions of songs on YouTube or Tumblr," Iconis says. "There's been a drive to perform the material. People wanted to just do it themselves."
The founders of Monumental - Mavrikes, Windsor and managing director Beth Amman, all 28 - quickly fell into the "do it ourselves" camp, with Smelkinson directing. Monumental is an emerging troupe founded in 2015, mainly using nonunion actors and working in a black box space on the campus of Alexandria's Episcopal High School. (Mavrikes is an Equity actor recently in "Newsies" with Oklahoma City's Lyric Theatre of Oklahoma; he spoke by phone on a conference call with Windsor.) Last year's "Pippin" is the troupe's most popular show so far, with "Be More Chill" sales in second place even before it opened July 11. The company, which includes a possible D.C. move in its growth plans, also has ventured area premieres of the musicals "Bonnie & Clyde" and, with Equity actor Kurt Boehm, "Daddy Long Legs."
Like Exit 82, Monumental secured the amateur rights and announced plans to stage it. Meanwhile, the surge in online interest led to last summer's off-Broadway production at Manhattan's Signature Center. Mavrikes and Windsor felt sure that the off-Broadway project would mean their production would get scrapped. They called the licensing agency several times to be sure they were still in business.
"They were like, 'Stop bothering us. You're fine,'" Windsor says.
Iconis and book writer Joe Tracz revised the show off-Broadway, and then the Broadway version - which runs through Aug. 11 - was changed even more. Iconis calls the Broadway version "3.0," and he understands that most producers and writers would thoroughly squelch 1.0 and any other productions at this stage of the game. After all, a huge dispute erupted earlier this year when small companies that purchased rights to Christopher Sergel's adaptation of "To Kill a Mockingbird" were slapped with cease-and-desist orders by producer Scott Rudin, whose new adaptation by Aaron Sorkin was a Broadway smash with plans to tour.
Sean Patrick Flahaven, president of Concord Theatricals, explains in an email: "Licensing a show while it's running in a Broadway or West End production or national tour is more unusual, but it's something we've done successfully with 'School of Rock' and will be doing for other shows we'll be announcing soon. That licensing, to amateur schools, universities, and youth groups, has proven to drive interest in and ticket sales for commercial productions and tours. For 'Be More Chill' specifically, with its young fan base, we felt it was particularly appropriate."
To date, Flahaven notes, 84 productions have been licensed, all for the original - the "Two River" version. Professional rights for the Broadway revision are being withheld in case a major national tour develops ... which means that yes, things would have been different if a big regional theater such as Arena Stage had been aiming to stage "Be More Chill" in the shadow of the Broadway venture.

'Send her back' rally: New chant, very old hate

Texto completo: HILLSBOROUGH, N.C. — In the summer of 1976, I first drove through the town of Smithfield, North Carolina. I was 19 and had just finished my sophomore year in college. The following day I planned to start a summer internship bringing health and legal services to the migrant farm workers — mostly African Americans — who traveled the East Coast each season to pick sweet potatoes, cucumbers and tobacco. As I approached the town, a giant and frightening billboard suddenly appeared roadside.
"This is Klan Country," it said. 'LOVE IT or LEAVE IT. Help fight communism and integration. Welcome to Smithfield"
For those unfamiliar with the highways and byways of North Carolina, Smithfield is but 70 miles from Greenville, North Carolina, the site of President Donald Trump's rally where chants of "send her back" echoed last week. More than 40 years later, the refrain really hasn't changed. Substitute "socialism" for "communism" and "immigration" for "integration."
The past is never really past Like many other white people coming of age in the 1970s, I had heard terrifying stories of the Ku Klux Klan's violence. But I was unaware that this hate group had for the most part remained active and powerful in many parts of the Tar Heel state, especially in the mid-1960s. Chalk that up to my naiveté — and outsider status (I grew up in New York City).
Upon graduation, I took a job in another isolated North Carolina county, just a few miles from Mount Airy, the birth place of Andy Griffith and the model for the town of Mayberry, the fictional and pastoral home to "The Andy Griffith Show." With a small state salary, I rented a trailer home from a white couple who showed me every courtesy but, fortunately, never asked me about my job — to ferry Hispanic farm workers from the migrant camps to health clinics. In retrospect, I'm sure my whiteness made my approval pro forma.
In a few short weeks, having paid my weekly rent on time, the talkative landlord began to confide in me. Not quite mano a mano. More like blanco a blanco.
Among the revelations: His membership in the local KKK chapter. Soon enough, he invited me to a Klan gathering, again my white skin appeared to tell my story. By then 21 years old, I was less naive than when I first encountered the Klan billboard in Smithfield. A foolhardy (to put it mildly) young man, I agreed to go along. Out in an open field, I witnessed a cross burning, the wearing of robes and a sea of Confederate flags in support of white nationalism. The rabid hatefulness of that dark night shocked me. It also terrified me: There was more to me than my skin color. I was of Jewish blood and then a closeted gay man, both disqualifying marks in the eyes of the Klan.
I left North Carolina the following year, never expecting to return. But I did in 2006 when my husband and I moved to Chapel Hill from the Bay Area to be nearer our ailing parents. All too soon the DNA of hate manifested itself, notably with the passage in 2016 of House Bill 2, what's known as the "bathroom bill," that mercilessly targeted transgender people for using the wrong restroom.
The law (yes, it was passed and signed into law, in the after hours of darkness) was mean-spirited and fear-based — and some of the surrounding rhetoric reminded me of what I had witnessed decades before. Shock? If only.
Hate: A national epidemic The year before, in 2015, my adopted home town of Hillsborough struggled with and finally decided to remove the words "Confederate Memorial" from the local history museum. That action spurred a backlash as hundreds descended on our town in a protest. Along with them: Confederate flags, kids in "rebel" caps and parents in Stars and Bars T-shirts.
"They're gonna race as fast as they can to erase us off the face of the Earth," one speaker told the crowd. The Raleigh News and Observer reported: "They eee-yowed the rebel yell on cue and intoned Dixie in unison, proclaiming that Southern culture and their way of life are in dire peril." Again, I felt the power of hate but not shock.
That's the same reason I wasn't shocked by the chants of "send her back" at Trump's rally in Greenville on Wednesday. I wish I could tell you I was, that such ribald hate is out of character for many of my fellow Tar Heels or my fellow Americans. But it is not.
I wish I could attribute it all to Donald Trump — a man who thrives on race hate, the fear of difference, and the disruption of social mores and manners. But I can't. I wish I could say North Carolina is an exception to the rule in these United States, but it is not. If I've learned anything in my two residencies in North Carolina, it's as William Shakespeare wrote, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves."

As I approached the town, a giant and frightening billboard suddenly appeared roadside.
“This is Klan Country," it said. 'LOVE IT or LEAVE IT. Help fight communism and integration. Welcome to Smithfield”
For those unfamiliar with the highways and byways of North Carolina, Smithfield is but 70 miles from Greenville, North Carolina, the site of President Donald Trump’s rally where chants of “send her back” echoed last week. More than 40 years later, the refrain really hasn’t changed. Substitute “socialism” for “communism” and "immigration" for "integration. "
The past is never really past
Like many other white people coming of age in the 1970s, I had heard terrifying stories of the Ku Klux Klan’s violence. But I was unaware that this hate group had for the most part remained active and powerful in many parts of the Tar Heel state, especially in the mid-1960s. Chalk that up to my naiveté — and outsider status (I grew up in New York City).
It has happened to every immigrant: Bullies told me to go back to my country. At first it silenced me, now it spurs me on.
Upon graduation, I took a job in another isolated North Carolina county, just a few miles from Mount Airy, the birth place of Andy Griffith and the model for the town of Mayberry, the fictional and pastoral home to “The Andy Griffith Show. ” With a small state salary, I rented a trailer home from a white couple who showed me every courtesy but, fortunately, never asked me about my job — to ferry Hispanic farm workers from the migrant camps to health clinics. In retrospect, I’m sure my whiteness made my approval pro forma.
In a few short weeks, having paid my weekly rent on time, the talkative landlord began to confide in me. Not quite mano a mano. More like blanco a blanco.
Among the revelations: His membership in the local KKK chapter. Soon enough, he invited me to a Klan gathering, again my white skin appeared to tell my story. By then 21 years old, I was less naive than when I first encountered the Klan billboard in Smithfield. A foolhardy (to put it mildly) young man, I agreed to go along. Out in an open field, I witnessed a cross burning, the wearing of robes and a sea of Confederate flags in support of white nationalism. The rabid hatefulness of that dark night shocked me. It also terrified me: There was more to me than my skin color. I was of Jewish blood and then a closeted gay man, both disqualifying marks in the eyes of the Klan.
I left North Carolina the following year, never expecting to return. But I did in 2006 when my husband and I moved to Chapel Hill from the Bay Area to be nearer our ailing parents. All too soon the DNA of hate manifested itself, notably with the passage in 2016 of House Bill 2, what’s known as the “bathroom bill,” that mercilessly targeted transgender people for using the wrong restroom.
The law (yes, it was passed and signed into law, in the after hours of darkness) was mean-spirited and fear-based — and some of the surrounding rhetoric reminded me of what I had witnessed decades before. Shock? If only.
Hate: A national epidemic
The year before, in 2015, my adopted home town of Hillsborough struggled with and finally decided to remove the words “Confederate Memorial” from the local history museum. That action spurred a backlash as hundreds descended on our town in a protest. Along with them: Confederate flags, kids in “rebel” caps and parents in Stars and Bars T-shirts.
Enough: My black, disadvantaged students live with racism. They don't need to see it on sneakers.
“They’re gonna race as fast as they can to erase us off the face of the Earth,” one speaker told the crowd. The Raleigh News and Observer reported: “They eee-yowed the rebel yell on cue and intoned Dixie in unison, proclaiming that Southern culture and their way of life are in dire peril. ” Again, I felt the power of hate but not shock.
That’s the same reason I wasn’t shocked by the chants of “send her back” at Trump’s rally in Greenville on Wednesday. I wish I could tell you I was, that such ribald hate is out of character for many of my fellow Tar Heels or my fellow Americans. But it is not.
I wish I could attribute it all to Donald Trump — a man who thrives on race hate, the fear of difference, and the disruption of social mores and manners. But I can’t. I wish I could say North Carolina is an exception to the rule in these United States, but it is not. If I’ve learned anything in my two residencies in North Carolina, it’s as William Shakespeare wrote, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. "

Texto completo: Viruses might not seem as common as they were a decade ago, but they still exist. Malicious software on your computer can wreak all kinds of havoc, from annoying pop-ups to covert bitcoin mining to scanning for personal information. If you're at risk for clicking perilous links, or if you share a computer with multiple people in a household, it's worthwhile to set up antivirus software, especially on Windows computers.
If your computer runs Windows 10, you should use Microsoft's built-in software, Windows Defender. Windows Defender offers plenty of security for most people, and it's the main antivirus option that Wirecutter, a review site owned by The New York Times, recommends; we reached that conclusion after speaking with several experts. If you run an older version of Windows (even though we recommend updating to Windows 10) or you use a shared computer, a second layer of protection might be necessary. For this purpose, Malwarebytes Premium is your best bet. Malwarebytes is unintrusive, it works well with Windows Defender, and it doesn't push out dozens of annoying notifications like most antivirus utilities tend to do.
Mac users are typically okay with the protections included in macOS, especially if you download software only from Apple's App Store and stick to well-known browser extensions. If you do want a second layer of security, Malwarebytes Premium is also available for Mac. You should avoid antivirus applications on your phone altogether and stick to downloading trusted apps from official stores. Thorin Klosowski

Is a billionaire populist the right choice for Democrats?

Texto completo: These are strange times, as Democratic voters consider whether the best way to take on a billionaire populist is to nominate their own inexperienced billionaire populist.
The Democratic presidential primary now has its 25th candidate, with the late entry of Bay Area billionaire Tom Steyer, a climate-change and impeachment activist.
Steyer hasn’t made a dent in the polls, but his money could shake up the race given his intent to spend $100 million.
So far, Steyer’s entry has gone over like a lead balloon. “Interviews with Democratic senators and representatives revealed significant resentment toward Steyer for his practice of using his wealth to pressure lawmakers that have not advocated for impeaching President Trump,” reported the Free Beacon.
His ads targeting anti-impeachment Democrats, and slams against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, haven’t made him many friends on the Left.
His personal wealth is an obstacle in a party that views billionaire financiers as a scourge. And his big-spending plans would find resistance with the broader electorate.
Steyer’s “Justice-Centered Climate Plan” might not go as far as the “Green New Deal,” but it’s estimated to boost government spending by $2.3 trillion — at a time when federal debt has soared to $22 trillion and both parties have agreed to obliterate spending caps.
Most observers view Steyer’s long-time environmental advocacy as sincere, but he has to deal with allegations of hypocrisy. The New York Times reported in 2014 that Steyer’s fund had “pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that operate coal mines and coal-fired power plants from Indonesia to China, records and interviews show.” He has expressed regret for fossil-fuel investments, but it makes for bad optics among Democrats.
Other Democratic candidates are peeved at a billionaire buying his way into the presidential fray. “All campaigns should be grassroots funded in a primary,” said U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who is polling in the top tier.
U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, has likewise criticized the role of billionaires in the election process. Several left-leaning commentators have rolled their eyes at Steyer’s entry and have asked him to just go away.
On the good side, Steyer has taken shots at the socialistic ethic that is emerging on the Democratic left.
“Should we put a limit on what Beyoncé makes?” he asked the Guardian. “I don’t see why. I don’t think in the United States of America we should put a ceiling on how far people can go.”
He even took aim at Karl Marx. We’re dismayed that it’s even necessary to point out the flaws of Marxism in 2019, but we’ll take small victories when we get them.
In our view, the Democrats have their best chance of unseating Donald Trump by running mainstream moderate-to-liberal candidates who campaign on national unity rather than progressives who are intent on remaking the economy and ratcheting up federal spending. But that’s ultimately for their voters to decide.
Based on Democratic Party rules, however, Steyer needs a large base of small donors or decent poll numbers to make it onto the stage.
Despite our misgivings about Steyer’s candidacy, there’s nothing wrong with having a freewheeling election where the largest number of candidates pitch their ideas.
We wish Steyer and the other candidates were discussing better ideas, but that’s a discussion for another day.

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — President Donald Trump would love to see Apple make iPhones in the USA and has been threatening tariffs to convince companies like Apple to move production here.
But for a variety of reasons, mostly dealing with the skills of overseas labor at manufacturing digital devices and the lower costs, the idea of bringing the iPhone here is a "pipe dream," says Tim Bajarin, a longtime industry analyst from Creative Strategies. "It's not going to happen. "
Building an iPhone XS Max, the current top of the line $1,100 iPhone, would cost consumers more than $2,000 if it was made here. A 25% tariff, as threatened by Trump, would add $250 or so to the price of the device, which consumers would either have to pay, or Apple would eat.
Apple's main competitor, Samsung, is based in South Korea and builds the premium Galaxy phones and others in Korea, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia and China.
Google has Pixel phones made in China. Amazon's Echo speakers are made there, as are most consumer tech products.
Apple bytes: Here are five takeaways on Foxconn in Wisconsin
Bye, iPhone 6: So now what should I buy as a budget option?
Apple this week asked the government to not put tariffs on parts it needed from China to build the new high-end $6,000 Mac Pro computer, but Friday, Trump said no way.
"Make them in the USA, no Tariffs!"
Apple had announced plans to build a factory in Austin, Texas, to make high-end Mac computers here, but recently shifted gears to get them made in China. In January, the New York Times outlined the various issues Apple had in getting devices made in Texas, most notably problems getting a specific screw that was only available in large quantities in China.
"The costs of doing it here makes it impossible," says Bajarin. The main components of an iPhone – screen, power chip, RAM, solid-state drive and camera sensor – are all made in China.
"The tariff outcome is unlikely to bring wholesale suppliers to the U. S. ," says Sridhar Tayur, a professor at the Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business. That said, he notes there's been a trend for companies to move out of China and look elsewhere due to higher labor costs, human rights abuses and environmental issues.
Bajarin says Vietnam has been the beneficiary, with many companies getting tax breaks to set up shop in the Asia country. Action camera maker GoPro shifted its U. S. production to Mexico in June, while still creating cameras for other countries in China.
China's Foxconn Technology Group, which builds iPhones for Apple in Shenzhen, announced with great fanfare two summers ago that it would work with Trump and build a plant in Wisconsin to make TV display panels. The company said it would spend $10 billion on a new plant, and create as many as 13,000 jobs. The state offered the company a controversial $3 billion in state incentives to make the move.
But as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, a member of the USA TODAY network reports, the factory has yet to be built, and it "will be significantly smaller and less costly than the type of plant specified in Foxconn’s contract with the state. "
Tayur says the experience of Foxconn in Wisconsin shows the perils of Chinese sub-contractors moving their operations to the United States. "If Foxconn cannot make it happen, I don't see how others can," he says.

Student newspaper case could upend journalism protections

Texto completo: It was a routine story for the University of Massachusetts Boston student newspaper that came straight out of the police blotter.
Campus security officers were looking for an unidentified man who had allegedly taken photos of women around the university. The newspaper published a short story about the search with a photo under the headline “Have You Seen This Man?"
Now, six years later, that story is at the heart of a free press battle and defamation case that has reached the state's highest court and could upend longstanding journalism protections.
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has stepped in to defend the former student editor and the college paper's right to publish the story, deeming the case to be in the public's interest. Media attorneys are penning amicus briefs and warning that — if the plaintiff succeeds — this case could severely hamper how journalists do their jobs and inform the public.
“I fear it would have a severe chilling effect on the news media to report on police investigations," said Jeff Pyle, an attorney with Prince Lobel Tye, who has represented the New York Times and the Boston Globe.
At issue is whether Mass Media, the university's independent student newspaper, overstepped by publishing the police report and photo.
Jon Butcher, a former security engineer at UMass Boston's information technology department and the man that police were looking for, argued that the story defamed him and damaged his relationship with his boss, forcing him to eventually leave UMass Boston. Butcher denied taking any photos of women, and after police searched his phone, they mostly found pictures of people riding the T or on the bus, according to court documents.
Police never arrested or charged Butcher with a crime. Butcher, who is representing himself in the case, could not be reached for comment.
A Massachusetts Appeals Court agreed with Butcher and concluded that because police never issued a search warrant or made an arrest, the information in the police report wasn't protected and the newspaper was liable. That decision has been appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which is likely to hear the case this fall.
That a student newspaper would now be at the center of one of the most important statewide fights over press freedoms in the past two decades is unusual, Pyle said.
“It's not the normal type of case you would see in the defamation case book," he said.
But, he noted, “The student press is not immune from claims of defamation . . . Student journalism is important journalism and can ruffle feathers the same way."
The UMass Boston weekly school newspaper has generally focused on campus life issues, such as student parking fees. When the paper has engaged in First Amendment fights, it has usually been against university staff or administrators who are withholding information or, as they did this past spring, removing and covering over newspapers in a public area during prospective student visits, because of an embarrassing front-page article.
“We don't get into a lot of conflicts," said Kelsey Hale, 21, a rising senior and editor-in-chief of the paper.
The reporters at the paper are careful about what they publish, Hale said. But they don't back away from controversial stories or chasing public records to get the news. For example, last school year, when university administrators were vague about a chemical incident in the new dorms, the reporters found the fire department reports that indicated a student was allegedly trying to manufacture drugs in his room and set off the alarm, drawing police and other emergency personnel in hazardous material suits.
“Our writers stayed up until midnight on a Friday to make sure it was accurate," Hale said. “We worked very hard to publish factual information."
Even though the case in front of the Massachusetts high court predates Hale's time at UMass Boston, she said the police blotters remain an important source of information, and the newspaper receives them on a weekly basis.
Police incident logs are crucial for all reporters, David Kravitz, a deputy state solicitor in Healey's office argued in court documents filed earlier this month.
Police provide media organizations with reports of unidentified people of interest or those involved in suspicious activities frequently, including in stabbings or robberies, Kravitz said in court documents.
“Publications of this kind serve important public interests: They alert residents to reports of possible wrongdoing in their neighborhoods, they inform residents of the activities of local law enforcement agencies, and they may assist law enforcement in completing investigations of suspected wrongdoing," Kravitz wrote.
As long as the news report is a “fair and accurate" reflection of the police log, it should be protected, Kravitz said. Requiring independent verification by the media, he wrote, would be a heavy burden.
But Richard Peltz-Steele, a professor at the University of Massachusetts School of Law, said the media should be more careful about simply reporting from police reports.
The police can be wrong, and in the internet age that incorrect information about a person can live on and do damage long after the case is closed, Peltz-Steele said.
“I think 25 years ago this would have been a clean victory for the press," he said. “Today I see courts more willing to parse the facts and give plaintiffs a chance . . . We as a society went massively protective of media in the name of a free press. But today the capacity of mass media to injure reputation and cause real suffering has reached unprecedented heights."
If the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upholds the lower court decision, the defamation case against the newspaper's editor will go to trial.
Cady Vishniac, 33, the UMass newspaper editor who was part of the team responsible for the publication of the original story in 2013, said she understands the damage that can be done by news articles.
She was the only student editor who Butcher was able to serve with court documents and her name is now linked to this defamation case.
Vishniac now lives in Michigan, has gotten a graduate degree in creative writing and is no longer in journalism. She said she worries about potential employers and colleagues searching her on the Internet and finding this defamation lawsuit.
“I am sure that there are greater issues at stake here," Vishniac said. “I just don't for the life of me understand how it got this far."

Texto completo: Aaron Hull, the chief Border Patrol agent in the El Paso Sector, is heading to Detroit on Monday to serve as the interim chief on a temporary duty assignment, according to a CBP spokesman.
The reason for assignment was not clear.
"Multiple members of the Border Patrol's senior leadership team are currently rotating on TDY assignments in both Headquarters roles and senior field positions nationwide," the CBP spokesman said.
The El Paso Sector has seen its share of controversy, with accusations that migrant children in the Clint, Texas, facility were being neglected, kept in jail-like holding facilities and suffering from outbreaks of diseases such as scabies and chickenpox.
The El Paso Sector includes El Paso and Hudspeth counties in West Texas and all of New Mexico.
Earlier this month, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus toured facilities in Clint and El Paso. Elected officials claimed women in the facility made accusations of "psychological torture," with one migrant woman telling lawmakers she had been told to drink from the toilet.
After the El Paso Times and New York Times published an article stating leadership knew for months that some children in the Clint station had no beds to sleep on, sometimes went hungry and had no way to clean themselves, Hull disputed the claims on CNN.
"I would dispute that the conditions are so bad as have been reported," Hull said during the interview. "I can't understand why some people would be making some of the allegations that they're making."
U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, who was among the politicians who toured the Clint and El Paso centers, has been vocal in her disapproval of conditions at the facilities. The freshman congresswoman testified July 12 before the House Oversight Committee alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York; Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts; and Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, on what she saw in the facilities.
"We've seen severe overcrowding in Border Patrol processing centers that is so inhumane, that the DHS Office of the Inspector General described it as 'dangerous' because it represents 'an immediate risk' to agents and migrants alike," she said in testimony.
The El Paso Times reached out to Escobar, but was told by a spokeswoman that she would not be commenting.

'Show me your papers' expands

Texto completo: President Donald Trump is taking Arizona's infamous "show me your papers" law nationwide.
The Trump administration is set to begin Tuesday an expanded crackdown on undocumented immigrants who cannot prove they've been in the country continuously for more than two years. Under this new rule that also applies to asylum seekers, immigration agents can arrest and deport immigrants without appearing before a judge.
Until now, the law applied to migrants who were within 100 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border.
So, why is this a big deal? For starters, it might be unconstitutional and that's why the American Civil Liberties Union has vowed to challenge it in court.
Let's hope the ACLU blocks it. Otherwise "brown" people across the nation could find themselves the targets just like Arizona Latinos did under the state's SB 1070, the "show me your papers" law.
The new effort could have the same impact it did in Arizona. The 2010 Arizona law required local police to ask for the immigration status of anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. For some officers, particularly Maricopa County Sheriff's deputies, that meant "brown" people.
It's called racial profiling.
Sure, immigration agents could judiciously target specific undocumented immigrants but we know Trump's goal is to deport as many as quickly as possible. That gives the agents license to racial profile people regardless of the immigration status.
U.S. citizens or even legal residents don't carry proof of it. But Trump's new rule puts the burden on individuals and who's likely to be targeted?
"This is a national 'show me your papers' law," Royce Murray, managing director of the American Immigration Council, told the New York Times. "The burden is on the individual to prove that expedited removal does not apply to them."
She added: "So if you don't have the necessary paperwork on you — to show that you have a lease, or that you have status — then you could be taken into custody to try to fight this. And the problem is that this is a fast-tracked process."
This isn't going to end well because it only adds fuel to the fire over illegal immigration and Trump's attacks on nonwhites in an already divided nation.
Let's be clear. Trump doesn't just want to stop asylum seekers at any cost and deport everyone who are in the country illegally. He wants a white America. What's the word for that?
Don't forget this is the president who wants immigrants from Norway. This is the president who told nonwhite Congresswomen – all U.S. citizens – "to go back to where they came from." And this is the same president who stood silent, staring back at a crowd of his supporters chanting "send her back," referring to Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia.
If Trump can attack influential lawmakers, what would stop his federal agents from going after ordinary "brown" people regardless of immigration status under the new rules?
U.S. citizens and those with legal status have nothing to worry about, right? Sure, but Trump's ire is with dark-skin immigrants crossing the U.S. Mexico border – many of them asylum seekers from Central America.
By default, anyone with dark-skin could be suspected of being in the country illegally – that's called racial profiling. Let's hope the ACLU blocks Trump in court. Otherwise, the "show me your papers" law will further intensify racial tensions across the country.

Texto completo: Since at least February, DoorDash drivers have known the company was at times dipping into their tips to cover their base pay. But it wasn't until Tuesday night that the on-demand meal delivery service said it would stop.
What changed? More customers finally got wise to how their tips were being used. And they didn't like it.
Announcing plans to rethink the controversial pay structure on Twitter, Chief Executive Tony Xu indicated it was backlash from the people placing all those takeout orders -- not the ones delivering them -- that forced the concession.

"It's clear from recent feedback that we didn't strike the right balance," Xu tweeted. "We thought we were doing the right thing by making Dashers whole when a customer left no tip. What we missed was that some customers who did tip would feel like their tip did not matter."
The practice first came to light earlier this year when couriers, confused about what and how they were being paid, began piecing together what little information they had as independent contractors and realized customers' tips were sometimes helping Doordash pay them the guaranteed base pay, not just supplementing their earnings.
But it wasn't until a recent New York Times report renewed attention to the practice and sparked outrage among customers and the public that Xu decided to change the policy.
"Going forward, we're changing our model -- the new model will ensure that Dashers' earnings will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order," Xu tweeted, saying "customer obsession" was one of the company's "core values." "We'll have specific details in the coming days."
The company's acknowledgment is a stark about-face from whendriver and tech worker backlash prompted San Francisco Supervisor Aaron Peskin to ask the Office of Labor Standards Enforcement to investigate DoorDash for a potential labor violation in February.
In an interview with Fast Company at the time, DoorDash said "we believe our model best serves both Dashers and customers.... Since implementing this pay model in 2017, Dasher retention and overall satisfaction have increased significantly while average delivery times have decreased."
Gig Workers Rising, a San Francisco group that represents on-demand laborers, tweeted it was "remarkable" Xu attributed the reason for the policy change to customers and not to the drivers who first complained about misuse of their tips.
"It was highly disrespectful of [Xu] to dismiss drivers when he announced this policy change," Shona Clarkson, an organizer with Gig Workers Rising, said in a statement. "He should have proactively said he would repay the wages taken from their workers. Instead, DoorDash will have pocketed millions of dollars taken from customer tips."
"DoorDash has shown time and time again they don't care about treating drivers with dignity and respect," she continued. "Drivers are the backbone of their service."
DoorDash isn't alone in the practice. As The Times first revealed in February, Amazon.com Inc. was in some cases using customer tips to guarantee Flex drivers' base pay. Amazon did not respond to questions about whether the company is considering changing its policy. Another company making use of this practice, Instacart, gave into pressure and quickly changed its policy when they were called out by drivers in February, as BuzzFeed News first reported.
As is often the case, independent contractors who work for gig economy companies like DoorDash, Instacart, Amazon Flex and others are left to do the extra work of cobbling together the meager information these companies give them to understand how they operate. While DoorDash said it indicated in its FAQ that tips were sometimes added to meet pay guarantees, the language is confusing and ambiguous enough that it's not immediately clear how tips are used.
"For each delivery, you will earn at least $1 plus customer tip, but DoorDash will ensure that your total earnings (including tips) are never less than the amount you're guaranteed when you're offered a delivery," the FAQ reads.
It later says: "When base pay plus tip is more than the guaranteed minimum, you keep that larger amount."
Workers across the gig economy demanding answers have long had to settle for templated responses from customer support representatives.
Responding to questions about tips from Flex drivers, Amazon, in emails obtained by The Times, repeatedly stated that drivers received 100% of tips but also that they "add any supplemental earnings required to meet our commitment that delivery partners earn $18-$25 per hour."
"They just hide behind the fact that they guarantee $18" an hour, driver Jeff Lee, told The Times in February. "Sounds great, but that $18 [an hour] guarantee could be all from customer tips while Amazon chips in zero."
In lieu of clear and direct communications from companies, many gig workers turn to online forums and groups looking for others who might have more information and banding together to trade documents and tips to ensure they are receiving what they have been promised going into the gig. Some turn to creative sleuthing to get clear answers.
The asymmetry in information, fragmented nature of the workforce and fear of retaliation make it possible for companies like DoorDash and Amazon to implement questionable labor practices like these often without significant pushback. Every so often, however, the same decentralized network dynamics can put companies in the midst of a bad PR blizzard they can't control -- as DoorDash learned this week.

Delivery app DoorDash to change controversial tipping policy after outcry

Texto completo: DoorDash, the nation's leading food-delivery app, is taking a tip from frustrated workers and customers - and passing along their drivers' hard-earned tips.
In a series of tweets Tuesday, CEO Tony Xu said the company would overhaul its controversial tipping policy. Under the current rule, a tip left through DoorDash's app is used to meet the minimum payment promised to its delivery crew. That's prompted customers, workers and advocacy groups to accuse DoorDash of using gratuities to underwrite drivers' paychecks.
Based on recent feedback, DoorDash realized that "some customers who *did* tip would feel like their tip did not matter," Xu wrote. The new rule: Workers' earnings "will increase by the exact amount a customer tips on every order." Xu said more details were still to come.
Take the New York Times reporter who recently set out as a food deliveryman and was guaranteed $6.85 for his first DoorDash order. A customer tipped $3 through the app. But the reporter received only $6.85. The company in turn reduced its own payment to $3.85 and used the $3 tip to meet the deliveryman's minimum guarantee. Issues with how delivery services tip have also been covered by NBC News.
Numerous DoorDash workers have aired the same grievance, often on online forums. One worker posted on Reddit that DoorDash "technically doesn't 'steal' your tip. They give it to you . . . BUT they use it to subsidize what they pay out of pocket which is basically the same thing at the end of the day."
Advocacy groups are pushing for more explanation from Xu. In a statement, Rachel Lauter, executive director of the labor organization Working Washington, said DoorDash "has been swiping customer tips since they first deployed their deceptive pay model in 2017." The company needs to explain how it will ensure those two years of tips are "accounted for and redistributed to the workers who should have received them in the first place," Lauter said.
Tipping has been a controversy for other delivery giants. Last year, Instacart implemented a new policy that guaranteed workers a $10 minimum payment for each delivery batch. But workers found that some of their tips went toward that $10 minimum and said their earnings quickly dropped. In February, Instacart reversed its payment policy and said tips would be separated from Instacart's minimum guarantee and that delivery workers would be retroactively reimbursed for when their tips went toward those minimums.
Postmates and Uber Eats say tips aren't used to subsidize workers' minimum guarantees, the Verge reported. Grubhub and Seamless told the Verge that drivers keep all tips and that "their per-order earnings" are set independent from gratuities. In February, the Los Angeles Times reported that Amazon sometimes used tips earned by contracted delivery drivers to meet their guaranteed earnings.

Which Disneyland attraction has the most riders since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened? You’ll be surprised

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Texto completo: You’d be forgiven for assuming the new Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction has had the most riders of any Disneyland attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge opened — but you’d be off by a long shot.
Disneyland announced last week that 1 million riders have ridden the Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run attraction since Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge debuted. That statistical peek behind the curtain tells us a lot about the ride capacity of the E-Ticket attraction and the number of people visiting the new themed land .
The Ridgeway family of Ocean Springs, Miss. were recognized as the 1 millionth riders of Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run on July 16, according to Disneyland.
Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily crowd sizes and ride wait times at theme parks, says that based on the available information Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has averaged about 27,000 riders per day since May 31, approximately 76% of the attraction’s ride capacity.
That pales in comparison to It’s a Small World (57,000 riders per day) and Pirates of the Carribbean (55,000) during the same period and is just short of Big Thunder Mountain (35,000), Hyperspace Mountain (31,000) and Indiana Jones Adventure (31,000), according to Touring Plans estimates.
You read that right: The half century-old Small World has had way more riders than the 2-month-old Smugglers Run.
But of course, Small World and Pirates are high-capacity people-eater rides that vacuum up visitors and often still manage to maintain relatively short wait times.
Disneyland officials said Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run has performed extremely well with very little downtime during the million-rider run thanks to the hard work and dedication of cast members and Walt Disney Imagineering, the creative arm of the company.
“Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is among our highest rated attractions and we are thrilled by the guest reviews we have received since opening,” Disneyland officials said in a statement.

Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge officially debuted on May 31 after a series of employee and media previews. Disneyland instituted a reservation-only period for Galaxy’s Edge that ran through June 23. Beginning June 24, the new Star Wars land was opened to all visitors. A virtual queue boarding pass system put in place to manage crowds has been rarely used.
While the million-rider mark sounds impressive, other Disneyland attractions likely outpaced Smugglers Run during the same period.
During Smugglers million-rider run, Small World and Pirates could have hit the same mark operating at approximately 45% of their hourly capacity while Big Thunder could have done it at 70% capacity and Hyperspace Mountain at 80%, according to Touring Plans.
Smuggler’s Run can accommodate up to 1,800 riders per hour, according to the New York Times.
The average wait time for Smugglers Run dropped from 47 minutes on opening day to 22 minutes on June 23, according to Touring Plans data. The average Smugglers Run wait time spiked to 59 minutes on June 24 — the first day guests could enter the land without a reservation — and reached a high of 89 minutes over the Fourth of July holiday weekend.
Using Smugglers Run ridership as a guide, Touring Plans estimates that Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge has attracted between 2.7 million and 5 million visitors since opening day.
“My strong suspicion is that the number is toward the bottom end of that range based on the low wait times we saw throughout June,” said Len Testa, president of Touring Plans, an online subscription service that lets users create custom theme park itineraries.
Disneyland rarely if ever talks about attendance numbers or ridership figures.
Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run is the lone anchor attraction in Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge until the Rise of the Resistance dark ride debuts on Jan. 17, six months behind schedule.
To the surprise of many theme park observers, Disneyland has experienced lighter than usual summertime traffic since Galaxy’s Edge opened May 31.

Texto completo: La ciudad de Los Ángeles no había visto tal brutalidad en décadas: asesinatos con machetes, bates de béisbol, cuchillos, tubos de metal; pandilleros que torturan a sus víctimas hasta la muerte y luego les sacan el corazón.
El fiscal del gobierno federal asignado al distrito centro de California, Nick Hanah, reveló el pasado 16 de julio los atroces crímenes de la Clica Fulton, la fracción más violenta y numerosa de la pandilla MS-13, también conocida como la Mara Salvatrucha.
La acusación contra 22 miembros de la Clica Fulton enlista crímenes que van desde el vandalismo, el tráfico de drogas y la extorsión hasta el asesinato de siete personas, seis de los cuales eran inmigrantes. Todos han sido detenidos y se encuentran bajo custodia, reportó el diario The New York Times.
Las detenciones han sido resultado de más de un año de investigaciones que involucraron a agencias federales, estatales y locales.
“Ya hemos sacado de las calles a casi dos docenas de personas asociadas con el brazo más violento de la MS-13 en Los Ángeles, donde se cree que la pandilla asesinó a 24 personas en los últimos dos años”, dijo Hanah en un comunicado de prensa.
Al jurado, sin embargo, sólo se le presentaron los casos de siete víctimas de homicidio, reportó el diario citado.
Los pandilleros llevaban a sus víctimas al Bosque Nacional de Los Ángeles. En una ocasión, secuestraron a un miembro de otra pandilla y lo ahogaron, posteriormente lo llevaron al bosque y allí lo descuartizaron, le arrancaron el corazón con un machete y arrojaron sus restos a un barranco. Su crimen había sido rayar una pinta o grafiti de la Clica Fulton.
Para entrar a la pandilla, los posibles nuevos reclutas tenían que probar su valor asesinando a un enemigo o adversario de la MS-13.
Aunque esto podía variar desde un miembro de otra pandilla hasta un indigente con la mala suerte de cruzarse en su camino, como sucedió con un hombre sin hogar que vivía en un parque “controlado por la pandilla”, dijo Hanah.
La mayoría, 19 de los 22, son inmigrantes indocumentados de entre 19 y 24 años y no tiene más de cinco años que llegaron al país. Recientemente, dijo el fiscal Hanah, la pandilla aumentó sus filas y su actividad criminal “con el flujo de jóvenes migrantes provenientes de Centroamérica”, reportó la cadena británica BBC Mundo.
“La mayor tragedia en estos casos es que estos jóvenes víctimas probablemente dejaron sus países de origen con la esperanza de que en los Estados Unidos encontrarían seguridad y prosperidad”, dijo la Fiscal del Distrito del Condado de Los Ángeles, Jackie Lacey.
“En cambio, estas víctimas tuvieron la desgracia de cruzar caminos con pandilleros violentos que se aprovecharon de las vulnerabilidades de su experiencia de inmigrante”.
Pero, a pesar del recrudecimiento de la violencia de pandillas como la Clica Fulton, en general, hay menos homicidios hoy Lós Ángeles que en la década de los años 90, cuando las pandillas dominaban , señaló a BBC Thom Mrozek, portavoz del Fiscal General del Departamento de Justicia para el distrito centro de California.

Robyn reveals how fans influenced her performance ahead of upcoming Forum concert: ‘I made the song, but they gave it the meaning’

Texto completo: Robyn took eight years to record her most recent album “Honey,” but when she called from Brussels last month on a European tour that all seemed like ancient history to the Swedish dance pop star. She returns to Southern California for her third date here this year on July 27.
“I feel like I have talked about it enough,” she says of the circumstances — the death of a close friend, a romantic partnership on the rocks — that led to the break from her acclaimed album “Body Talk” in 2010 and the follow-up that landed in October. “But I will say some things about it.
“It was a very particular time of my life, which I’m really thankful for,” Robyn says. “I was also in a privileged situation where I could take time off — a lot of people can’t do that. I really had the means and the space to explore things, and get to know myself better, which is such a luxury and something I really don’t regret at all.”
Her show at the Forum in Inglewood on Saturday, July 27 follows a pair of shows at the Palladium in Los Angeles in February where fans heard many of the songs on “Honey” live for the first time. It was clear then as it was on the record that with “Honey” she had taken the difficulties with which she’d wrestled and used that make music that over its dance beats and rhythms offered comfort, hope and joy.
“I think in order to talk about the things that are difficult, sadness and pain and stuff, sometimes you do it from a really unconscious place, but for me it was important to know what it was I wanted to talk about,” she says. “I wanted it to have that depth because I think it’s like the thing you can do as an artist for the people that listen to your music.
“You can make discoveries about yourself, and then you can present them to people in a way where they can explore things that they might recognize they felt before, or things that they haven’t felt before but when you describe it to them they know.”
We should note that Robyn’s music isn’t sad or bittersweet so much as cathartic. Singer Sam Smith, who works a similar vein in the pop mines, told the New York Times in a story about Robyn last year that what makes her brilliant is her “mixture of sadness and euphoria,” two sides of life that Robyn says are essential to each other.
“It’s just how I experience life,” she says. “For me, it’s not a constant. It’s kind of like I think melancholy, and also happiness or sadness or whatever, they don’t feel as good if the other thing isn’t there.
“Only sadness, it can be really, really painful,” Robyn says. “Only happiness can be really weird as well. There’s always the other side and I think those are the most interesting moments, when you can feel both of those things together.”
On “Honey,” though, she consciously moved in a lighter direction, she says.
“I think there’s another space which I’m exploring now, and I think a little bit more on this record, which is not as dramatic,” Robyn says. “I may have people thinking I’m not doing well” — she laughs — “but for me it'[s important to find something that’s less dramatic, that’s more about fun.
“Not fun like no problems, but like playfulness, like a sense of relaxation,” she says. “Which I think (the title song) ‘Honey’ is about and other things on this album as well.”
The Forum show will be similar to the Palladium dates, though the set has changed in the five months since then.
“When we played the Palladium, we were still adding and changing things, so it will be different,” Robyn says. “A lot is similar but we’ve played so many shows since then, so to me the show has matured.”
One constant highlight is how she and her band include the crowd in the performance of “Dancing On My Own,” a song from the “Body Talk” album on which the band drops out for the chorus to let the crowd sing, a truly chills-inducing moment in her show. That song, in which its protagonist is in the club watch an ex-lover dance with another, has been taken over by her fans in ways she says she never imagined.
“I really didn’t know or understand what ‘Dancing On My Own’ has meant to my fans,” she says. “But I understand from people telling me. So whether it’s me watching, like, people dance in a subway or Instagram about a night out listening to my music, those are things I see, and then, of course, I feel the response from the audience when I’m touring.”
On the “Body Talk” tour there were moments where the audience sang so loudly she could hardly hear herself, so sometimes Robyn and the band simply stopped playing for a few bars. For this tour, they decided to make it a feature of the song.
“It’s like they’re singing the song back to us, which is also a way of acknowledging them, and what they have done with the song in their lives,” she says. “(It’s) what happens when I’m not there. What happens when they’re in a karaoke bar or with friends, or they’re listening to the song at home.
“That’s something that I never get to see,” Robyn says. “It’s like a moment to share that. I made the song, but they gave it the meaning or whatever it has in their life.”

The media coverage of the Green New Deal, a plan unveiled by U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress to overhaul the U.S. economy by investing in renewable energy and green jobs, focused as much on its reception as on its substance. Republicans panned it as socialism. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi mocked it. Many columnists, such as the New York Times’ David Brooks, criticized its heavy reliance on public spending and government-provided jobs. Other critics questioned the plan’s broad focus. What, they asked, did provision of medical care have to do with overhauling America’s energy network?
The casual observer could be forgiven for dismissing the plan and the response to it, especially because it has no chance of passing in the current Congress. But the plan is a sign of a larger shift in environmental thinking. There is a growing recognition of the need for structural changes to address the climate crisis and other serious environmental problems. An increasing number of influential office holders and thinkers are calling for policies that go far beyond mere tinkering. To overhaul our energy system and preserve threatened ecosystems, they recognize that we must aggressively disrupt the status quo.
The best part of the Green New Deal is its insistence on bold steps to slow climate change and develop an economy based on renewable energy. As its name suggests, the plan is predicated on the idea that individual behavioral change will not lead to sharp reductions in greenhouse emissions or deliver meaningful environmental progress in other areas. We must, its authors insist, overhaul our economy to meet our environmental responsibilities. Even those who question this premise should celebrate the plan’s audacious goals.
Other environmental thinkers echo this skepticism about behavioral change. David Wallace-Wells, author of a recent book on climate change, concludes, “The effects of individual lifestyle choices are ultimately trivial compared with what politics can achieve.” While Wallace-Wells may find fault with some aspects of the Green New Deal, including its silence regarding nuclear power, he enthusiastically endorses the need to think big.
We must focus our efforts not on changing our individual behavior but on far-reaching communal changes.
The emphasis on the need to overhaul our economic, technological and social systems is a welcome departure from the fixation with individual behavior that often dominates popular environmental discourse. The furor over use of plastic straws, which became a litmus test of environmental responsibility in some circles over the past couple of years, suggests the limitations of this preoccupation with individual action. Americans concerned about excessive use of plastic should worry much more about laws recently passed by several states that ban municipalities from imposing bans on plastic bag distribution in retail stores than about whether the diner at the next table is using a plastic straw. To make substantial environmental progress we must get beyond environmental narcissism — excessive concern about the consumption habits of ourselves and our family and friends. We must focus our efforts not on changing our individual behavior but on far-reaching communal changes.
Individual vs. collective action
Recent developments in St. Paul suggest that this will be a challenge. In October 2018 the city implemented a new residential waste collection system. Under the old system, households contracted with a trash hauler of their choice. St. Paul was one of the largest cities in the United States to use this free-choice model. On many blocks, residents contracted with several hauling firms. The result was that trucks from multiple haulers plied the same alleys on different days, spewing exhaust and wearing down the road.
Fed up with this system, residents held forums throughout the city to solicit feedback on the existing system and ideas about alternatives. (Disclosure: I helped organize these forums.) These forums ultimately led to a state-sanctioned process under which St. Paul negotiated a contract with haulers that divided the city into zones so each neighborhood was assigned a single hauler. Although recent events have called the system — and the city’s response — into question, currently it works like this: No longer do several trucks a week come barreling down residents’ alleys. Instead, recycling and trash collection now occur on the same day, reducing emissions and truck traffic. Russ Stark, St. Paul’s chief resilience officer, estimated that switching to organized collection reduced greenhouse gas emissions associated with garbage truck traffic by as much as 75%.
Ultimately, the most important thing that we can do as citizens is to change the systems that pollute the Earth.
As with any new system, there were complaints from various quarters. Some of the most vociferous criticism came from those who had previously shared bins with neighbors, a practice that, though technically illegal, was widespread. These bin-sharers argued that the new system, which required each household to pay for its own bin to fairly distribute operational costs, discouraged conservation and was unduly expensive.
Why, I wondered, would some of my neighbors dwell on the remote possibility that a sliver of households might produce more trash under the new system when, as a city, we were drastically slashing diesel emissions from garbage trucks? Couldn’t they see that this focus on individual behavior was misplaced next to the significant environmental benefits of putting an end to the parade of trucks?
Catalyze structural change
The desire to become a more ecologically responsible consumer and citizen is admirable, but it falls well short of the environmental change we need. Even as more Americans packed their groceries into reusable bags and toted their metal water bottles to the gym, Congress passed virtually no significant environmental legislation. By defining environmental citizenship as responsible consumption, sustainability advocates downplay the need for mass action to catalyze structural change. Fortunately, a new generation of leaders is unveiling a much more wide-ranging environmental agenda, as exemplified by the Green New Deal.
Of course, we should encourage personal environmental responsibility. Modifying our individual dietary, travel and consumption habits can lead to reduced pollution and better air quality, among other benefits. We should make these smaller improvements — but not at the expense of the much-needed focus on transformational environmental changes.
Ultimately, the most important thing that we can do as citizens is to change the systems that pollute the Earth. Those in the vanguard of the environmental revolution that we so desperately need will not spend their waking hours discussing the finer points of eschewing plastic straws. They will be pounding on the doors of their congressional representatives to demand the wide-ranging changes that only government, directly or indirectly, can deliver.

Texto completo: Ryan Adams cryptically teased that he has "a lot to say" and will share it soon, five months after he was accused of misconduct and emotional abuse.
The singer shared a lengthy post on Instagram on Saturday, without specifically addressing any of the allegations made by multiple women.
"I have a lot to say," Adams wrote. "I am going to. Soon. Because the truth matters. It's what matters most. I know who I am. What I am. It's time people know. Past time."
He continued, "My work was always meant to be a map for the lost. I've tried my best to be open and accountable. Not a billboard. I mean, maybe for being flawed. I've always wanted to help. I'm trying. So, soon ... because it's time to get back to what I do best. I'm here for the music, for the love and for making things better."
Adams, 44, had remained out of the public eye since multiple women came forward with their claims against him in a February report published by The New York Times. One of the accusations asserts Adams took part in video calls and text messages with an underage girl that sometimes featured explicit content.
In that article, a lawyer for the singer said Adams denied ever having "inappropriate online sexual communications with someone he knew was underage." After the report was published, Adams also tweeted that the piece presented a picture of him that is "upsettingly inaccurate."
Among the other accusers in that report was his ex-wife, singer and actress Mandy Moore, who accused Adams of being manipulative and psychologically abusive.

Synagogue stories

Texto completo: It wasn't exactly a task of biblical proportions, but over the past four years Brad Kolodny of Plainview has managed to photograph every synagogue that ever existed from the Queens line to Montauk Point, at the same time chronicling the life and times of more than 400 buildings that have been used by Long Island Jewish congregations, some disbanded long ago.
The result of his odyssey is "Seeking Sanctuary: 125 Years of Synagogues on Long Island," a 128-page coffee table book released last month by Segulah Press, a new Merrick-based Jewish publishing house. The book has profiles of every synagogue, past and present, and more than 300 photographs, including of some two dozen buildings that were deconsecrated and sold as residential or commercial properties, bought by other faiths or demolished. There's a list of the 20 oldest surviving synagogues on Long Island and a chronology of Jewish life here beginning in the early 18th century.
"I wanted to document synagogues in a book because Judaism is changing," said Kolodny, 49, who works for The New York Times as an advertising sales representative. "Congregations are merging and buildings are being sold off and torn down."
Readers can see photos of Setauket's Agudas Achim, which Kolodny said was the first synagogue built on Long Island, in 1896, and abandoned during World War I. From 1948 to 1971, it was the home of North Shore Jewish Center, which moved to a new building in Port Jefferson Station. Subsequently, the building was acquired by Setauket United Methodist Church and is in use as a thrift shop. He also focuses on the West Hempstead Quonset hut that housed Nassau Community Temple through the 1950s. Kolodny said the congregation disbanded in the 1990s, its former sanctuary turned into a Beverage Barn, then a laundromat - its current incarnation.
Kolodny also took interior and exterior photos of Temple Emanu-El of East Meadow, a beehive-shaped, multicolored landmark on Merrick Avenue since 1957. The building was demolished this year after its congregation merged with a Wantagh synagogue, Kolodny said.
Kolodny's interest in photographing synagogues began while growing up in New City, in Rockland County. On teen travels he photographed what he said is the nation's oldest Jewish sanctuary, Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode Island. His shutterbug skills were honed as a student press photographer at the University at Albany, where he graduated in 1992 with a bachelor's degree in business administration.
The idea for the book project came to Kolodny in 2015 during a service at his synagogue, Midway Jewish Center in Syosset, as he sat contemplating a sanctuary renovation that was underway."
He had been in favor of the renovation as a "very good indicator of a strong, vibrant congregation," but began to "consider all the memories that become less vivid in a new space," Kolodny said recently. He also began to ponder "what memories had been lost at other synagogues over the years."
He began to take pictures near his home for his Instagram account, instagram.com/synagoguesoflongisland, which has more than 600 followers. As the hobby grew into a book project, Kolodny visited and photographed every active Jewish house of worship from Great Neck and Cedarhurst in western Nassau County to Montauk and Greenport out east.
To compile a definitive list, he consulted rabbis, congregational leaders and historical societies.
Rabbi Tuvia Teldon, regional director of Chabad Lubavitch of Long Island, said Kolodny's work is a benefit to Long Island's Jewish community.
"I have been very impressed by his [Kolodny's] diligence and his attention to detail, as he often contacted me to make sure he had included every Chabad location, past and present," Teldon said, adding, "I hope this work shows young Jewish people today that we have much to be proud of from the past."
Kolodny also combed newspaper archives, library and museum collections, and thumbed through such historical documents as old phone books and county land records.
"As someone who grew up in Massapequa, I was amazed at the rich Jewish history that existed in places that I've known for my entire life," said Rabbi Dave Siegel of Merrick, founder and publisher of Segulah Press and director of Hofstra's Hillel chapter, which serves Jewish college students.
Siegel said that "Seeking Sanctuary" is available online on Amazon and Barnes & Noble and will soon be sold in Jewish bookstores on Long Island. Kolodny also plans to speak at author appearances in Long Island synagogues.
Although the Long Island project is complete, Kolodny is seeking synagogues to photograph on travels from the West Coast to Northern Europe.
Earlier this summer he vacationed with his wife and two kids in Norway, where he snapped a shot of Oslo's lone synagogue. He's motivated, he said, by "Jewish pride."
"You can go anywhere in the world and there's a synagogue," Kolodny said.
CORRECTION: Several facts are incorrect in today's LI Life story "Synagogue Stories," which was printed in advance. Kingdom Ambassadors Global Assembly is in Lynbrook; "Seeking Sanctuary: 125 Years of Synagogues on Long Island" chronicles more than 400 buildings that have been used by Jewish congregations on Long Island; the book has profiles of every synagogue, past and present, and more than 300 photographs, including of some two dozen buildings that were deconsecrated and sold; and Setauket's Agudas Achim congregation later became North Shore Jewish Center. (Pg. 20 7/21/19)

Texto completo: One month before Apollo 11 lifted off for the moon, William Safire received a phone call.
Most of us probably remember Safire as a political columnist and wordsmith for The New York Times. But in 1969, he was President Richard Nixon's speechwriter. And on the line was Frank Borman, the veteran astronaut and NASA's liaison with the White House.
"You want to be thinking of some alternative posture for the President in the event of mishaps on Apollo 11," Borman said, as Safire remembered in his autobiography.
Safire was confused. He said in an interview later that Borman's words sounded like "gobbledygook." Borman broke the silence and cut to the chase.
"Like what to do for the widows," he said.
Borman knew of what he spoke. He had been commander of Gemini 7 and Apollo 8, the first mission to fly around the moon. And he was a member of the review board that investigated the Apollo 1 fire that killed all three astronauts on board during a launch rehearsal in 1967.
Apollo 11 was viewed as NASA's most dangerous mission. Landing on the moon was difficult enough. But no one was sure the lunar module would be able to lift off the moon's surface. And if it couldn't, no rescue would be coming. Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would be doomed.
Safire prepared a powerfully poignant speech, one Nixon thankfully never had to deliver. It talked about humans in ancient times looking to the stars and seeing heroes in the constellations, and modern mankind finding heroes in "epic men of flesh and blood."
And it closed with an epitaph inspired by poet Rupert Brooke's salute to British soldiers who died in World War I:
"For every human being who looks up at the moon in the nights to come will know there is some corner of another world that is forever mankind."
I mention this not because it's a fascinating anecdote about one of America's iconic successes, but because it shines light on the meaning of courage.
Put yourself in Armstrong's and Aldrin's spacesuits.
They literally were facing the unknown. They boldly went where no human had gone before. There had been troubles aplenty in the space program up to then and more would follow (like the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters that killed seven crew members each in 1986 and 2003).
And Armstrong and Aldrin did face problems, like when the module overshot the relatively flat landing site by 4 miles. With alarms sounding, Armstrong had to manually pilot away from a boulder-strewn area, touching down with only 30 seconds of fuel in the landing tank.
Courage wells when an outcome is uncertain. Courage is what allows you to understand a risk, accept that you might not overcome that risk, and decide to persevere nonetheless. Courage is quiet and graceful, not loud and profane. It is steeled with conviction, not bravado.
Courage is not only about physical feats, like exploring a new world or facing an enemy's bullets. It's about making an unpopular decision you know is right, and sticking to it. It's taking responsibility for your words and actions, and for the words and actions of others you inspire. It's acknowledging that you were wrong, and making amends. It's choosing to keep moving forward when the road looks too tough to traverse.
Many NASA astronauts have said their courage stemmed not from a belief in their own abilities but in knowing they were part of something greater and serving a common good - in this case, their country.
Landing on the moon was a marvelous technological feat. But as we celebrate that, we also should remember that the mission's beating heart was the courage of epic men.

Texto completo: SUNDAY BUSINESS
The Economic View column last Sunday misstated what the official unemployment rate would be in a hypothetical example if the Labor Department were to merge the existing unemployment rate with the labor force participation rate. It would be 52 percent (310 divided by 600), not 48 percent (290 divided by 600).
METROPOLITAN
An article on Page 4 this weekend about the Staten Island district attorney's office and the borough's reluctance to join the progressive wave of criminal justice reforms misidentifies the city agency that provided data on cash bail. It is the New York City Criminal Justice Agency, not the Criminal Justice Authority.
ARTS & LEISURE
An article on Page 8 this weekend about Poul Ruders and his most recent opera, "The Thirteenth Child," misstates the dates and order of two of Mr. Ruders's other operas. "The Handmaid's Tale" was his second opera and debuted in 2000, not 2005; "Kafka's Trial" was his third and debuted in 2005, not 1990.
An article last Sunday about the play "Mojada" misspelled the name of the churro vendor character. She is Luisa, not Louisa.
SUNDAY STYLES
An article last Sunday about the increasing popularity of sparkling water misspelled the surname of a co-founder of Bevi, a carbonation machine company. He is Sean Grundy, not Gundy.
TRAVEL
An article last Sunday about Delphi, Greece, misspelled the name of an ancient water source in Delphi. It was the Castalian Spring, not the Castilian Spring.
An article on July 7 about the revival of an industrial Toronto street misspelled the surname of the president and publisher of the House of Anansi publishing company. She is Sarah MacLachlan, not McLachlan. The article also attributed an incorrect distinction to Ms. MacLachlan. She is not a founder of the company.
The 36 Hours article on July 7, about Rockaway Beach in Queens, included an incorrect price for a standup-paddle-board yoga class at Rockaway Jet Ski. It is $ 40, not $ 50.
An article on July 7 about the state of vineyards in Sonoma County, Calif., after the 2017 wildfires misidentified a type of grass at the Bouverie Preserve. It is bear grass, not deer grass.
REAL ESTATE
A picture credit last Sunday with the On the Market article misidentified the photographer of the townhouse in Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn. It is Emily Gilbert for The New York Times, not Katherine Marks for The New York Times.
MAGAZINE
An article on July 14 about streaming services misstated the platform that carries the show "Russian Doll." It is Netflix, not HBO.

Obama officials: New $20 bill not being delayed

Texto completo: Congressional Democrats have been hammering the Trump administration for delaying the introduction of 19th- century abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) called it an "insult to the hopes of millions," while Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said the delay sends an "unmistakable message to women and girls, and communities of color." The Treasury Department's inspector general, under pressure from Democratic lawmakers, recently said it will investigate the timing of the new currency.
But the rollout of the new currency has a more complicated backstory. Three current or former high-ranking government officials who served in the Obama administration, and were involved in the design and release of currency, said the Trump administration has not delayed the release of a new $20.
Instead, they say, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin - while expressing indifference about Tubman's placement on the currency, whereas his predecessor backed the change - has followed a timeline set under the Obama administration for the introduction of the new $20 bill.
In 2016, President Obama's Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said a "final concept design" of the Tubman $20 would be released in 2020. He asked the government to accelerate the process of the redesign, saying the new look would be released by 2020, the 100th anniversary of women winning the right to vote.
But inside the agency, some government officials doubted that deadline could be met. A confidential 2013 report by the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee, an interagency group that oversees the redesign of U.S. currency, said the $20 would not enter circulation until 2030, similar to the timeline announced by the Trump administration, according to Larry R. Felix, director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from 2006 to 2015.
Felix and other senior officials believed it would not be possible to release a "concept" design of Tubman on the $20 in 2020, given that these designs are never released several years - much less an entire decade - before they enter circulation.
The Treasury can release "concept" designs before the currency enters circulation in the economy, but it has never done so more than a year in advance, according to a spokesperson for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The spokesperson said the precaution is aimed at depriving hackers and other counterfeiters from having additional time to prepare for new denominations.
Felix said he told Treasury officials before leaving in 2015 that their plans to introduce a new $20 design in 2020 were not feasible, given how much security work still had to be done.
"Those announcements were not grounded in reality. The U.S. had not at the time acquired the security features to redesign and protect the notes," Felix said of Lew's announcement that a design of the $20 would be released in 2020.
Another former government official appointed by Obama, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak about internal government deliberations, also said the new $20 had always been scheduled for release toward the end of next decade. A current high-ranking government official appointed by Obama confirmed this account.
Still, Mnuchin has not shown the enthusiasm for putting Tubman on the $20 that his predecessor did - and Trump has previously dismissed the effort. Mnuchin has told lawmakers he has not made a decision on whether he supports Tubman being on the $20, unlike Lew, who publicly supported the effort.
But Mnuchin has also said he is not focused on the decision because it is unlikely to be his to make under "even the most optimistic scenarios," given that the government's timeline does not call for production to begin on the new $20 until after the end of a potential second Trump term.
According to the Treasury, production on the new $20 will begin in 2028, with its release coming in 2030.
The history of the redesign has been convoluted, feeding into the current political fracas.
Initially, Lew eyed replacing Alexander Hamilton on the $10 with women's voting rights pioneer Susan B. Anthony, as the $10 was scheduled for redesign before the $20. But the Obama administration faced public pressure not to replace Hamilton on the $10, due in part to the popularity the Founding Father enjoyed from the hit Broadway musical "Hamilton."
In 2016, Lew announced that Hamilton would remain on the $10, and that a vignette of women, including Susan B. Anthony, would appear on the back of that currency. (The BEP has said the redesigned $10 will not enter circulation until 2026.)
As he announced Hamilton would stay on the $10, Lew also said Tubman would replace Jackson on the front of the new $20. It was clear to currency officials working at the time that the bill would not enter circulation until late in the following decade, according to two former senior government officials in the Obama administration.
Through a spokeswoman, Lew declined to comment on the record or answer questions sent in an email. Spokespeople for congressional Democrats also did not respond to the remarks by Felix and the other former Obama officials.
Lew has said publicly that the new $20 would have to be decided by a future presidential administration, and has been silent on the recent accusations about Mnuchin delaying Tubman's appearance on the $20.
A fourth Obama administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said in an email: "While Secretary Lew directed the BEP to accelerate the process for the $5, $10 and $20 notes, he always put security first and acknowledged that the ultimate timing and sequence would be based on security features. "
Appearing on Capitol Hill in May, Mnuchin said the new design of the $20 with Tubman would not be unveiled in 2020. Citing anonymous current and former Treasury officials, the New York Times also reported in June that Mnuchin delayed the new $20 design to avoid antagonizing Trump, who has compared himself favorably to Jackson, and causing the president to scrap the redesign entirely and inviting additional public outcry.
Jackson was a slaveholder and slave trader who enabled the aggressive persecution of Native Americans and curtailed political and economic rights of black Americans. Tubman, a leader in the Underground Railroad, is one of the great antislavery heroes of American history. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump called replacing Jackson with Tubman "pure political correctness."
But the Treasury Department has denied delaying designs of the new $20, with Mnuchin saying he has not interfered in the process. Monica Crowley, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, said in a statement that "the suggestion that the process is being delayed is completely erroneous." A spokesperson for the BEP said Mnuchin has not interfered with the process of producing a new $20 design.
"The timeline for issuing a new $20 note remains consistent with the prior Administration's," a Treasury Department spokesman said in a statement. "As the Department and Bureau of Engraving and Printing have consistently stated, the only consideration with regard to the redesign schedule of our Nation's currency has been security and potential counterfeiting threats."
Last month, the New York Times published what it termed a "conceptual design" of the Tubman $20, but the former Obama officials said its existence does not suggest a public release was imminent. In congressional testimony last fall, BEP director Leonard R. Olijar also said the ACD decided in 2013 that the $20 bill would not be released until 2030. Olijar was also appointed by President Barack Obama.
"BEP was never going to unveil a note design in 2020," Olijar said in a recent statement. "No Bureau or Department official has 'scrapped' anything. "

Texto completo: Two culinary celebrities with strong ties to the Bay Area are among the list of "20 Power Players of Food Media," as determined by The Hollywood Reporter.
Guy Fieri, dubbed by THR as "The Culinary Populist," and Samin Nosrat, called "The Next Big Thing," both made the list, which spotlights food media's "most significant creators, execs and icons."
Of Fieri, a Santa Rosa resident, THR wrote, "No matter what you think of his platinum-blond tips or trips to Flavortown,' Fieri, 51, has a golden touch. He has three Food Network shows, reaching more than 15 million adults 25-to-54 in the first quarter.
"Heading into its 30th season, the flagship Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives' or triple D,' as he refers to it has been the most impactful, in ratings and for the eateries featured (which see a post-airing visitor bump even in reruns). Though a scathing New York Times review of his shuttered Times Square restaurant generated plenty of social media attention, Fieri has 70 restaurants in the U.S."
Nosrat, who attended UC Berkeley and became a cook at Alice Waters' fabled Chez Panisse restaurant, published a bestselling cookbook, "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat," in 2017. The accompanying 2018 Netflix show made her "a culinary rock star."
The THR piece goes on to point out: "In a bidding war, Random House acquired her book follow-up (What to Eat'), and Netflix is awaiting her pitch for a second series. (Nosrat jokes that the working title is Carbs of the World.') And while Netflix won't reveal audience stats, anecdotal evidence of Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat's' success is formidable. Unscripted producers and executives are near-unanimous in their praise of the project, part elemental cooking tutorial and part travelogue, as the newest high bar in the genre."
Of her TV fame, Nosrat tells THR, "I'm still wrapping my mind around the fact that if I say something is yummy, everyone wants it. It's about harnessing that power for good."
Also making the list were Tom Colicchio and Padma Lakshmi, who gained fame via Bravo's "Top Chef." They are frequent Bay Area visitors, and Colicchio is one of the celebrity chefs who will appear at the Gilroy Garlic Festival next weekend.
Among others on the THR list: Jose Andres, Alton Brown, David Chang, Bobby Flay, Ina Garten, Carla Hall, Nigella Lawson, Gordon Ramsay and Rachael Ray.

The news avoiders have opted out

Texto completo: NPR in May changed the long-familiar theme music to its “Morning Edition” newscast.
After 40 years of hearing B.J. Leiderman’s original score every weekday, you were either sick of it, or, for sticks in the mud such as yours truly, flummoxed at the very idea of messing with a good thing.
But I’ll get over it. Especially ‘cause the new, poppy, synthy thing is just a rewrite of the old tune anyway. Same chord progression; a few tweaks.
The reason for the move by the public radio commissars in D.C.?
It was, as Josh Benton wrote for Nieman Lab, “for the kids.”
Meaning, trying to get a few listeners under 60 to listen to the show.
The New York Times wrote: “The new theme is intended to attract a younger and more diverse audience, while also aligning with the evolution of ‘Morning Edition’ into a newsier program, said Kenya Young, the executive producer. ‘I wanted a sound and a mood and a tone and a feel and a vibe all mixed in one,’ she said.”
Actual young people seem to consume as much radio news as they do daily print newspapers. Meaning, none. The only reason I know at least one 20something has ever listened to a second of NPR is that Clementine Creevy’s great L.A. rock band Cherry Glazerr takes its name from KCRW’s morning host Chery Glaser, who Clem used to hear in her parents’ car as they drove her to school.
So where do young people get their news? I know, I know, Instagram, fool.
But it’s not just Millennials who don’t follow the old-fashioned definition of what’s going on in the world. Academics who study the subject say that, at a time when it is far easier than ever to get an enormous amount of information about everything by clicking on the screen of that telephone in your pocket, many are simply opting out.
Josh Benton, again, for Nieman: “News, you may have noticed, isn’t that great at generating happiness these days. So lots of people are happy to stick to Keanu and avoid Trump/Iran/Putin/climate change/mass shootings/Brexit/racism entirely.”
Yes, of course, there have been plenty of times as terrifying as these, and people still followed — hungered for — the news. When the Third Reich was bombing London and on the brink of ruling Europe, that didn’t stop people from listening to Edward Murrow broadcasting from the rooftops. So mere logic won’t do here. Something else is going on.
As someone who learned to read at age 4 out of fascination with the morning newspaper, and haven’t stopped since, it doesn’t matter that this makes no sense to me. It’s a thing. Benton cites data from Digital News Report: “In 2017, 29 percent of those surveyed worldwide said they ‘often or sometimes avoid the news,’ including 38 percent in the United States and 24 percent in the U.K. By 2019, those numbers had increased to 32 percent worldwide (+3), 41 percent in the U.S. (+3) and 35 percent in the U.K. (+11). (Even the Japanese — the world’s most devoted news consumers — saw news avoidance increase from 6 to 11 percent.)”
Harshing their vibe is the major reason for news avoidance, 57 percent of the avoiders said: “It can have a negative effect on my mood.”
Second, yes, is the more than a third of us who have concocted a conspiracy theory about the press: “I can’t rely on news to be true,” say 35 percent. You want real untruthiness? Try the internet.
“I haven’t read a newspaper in years,” said one respondent. “It was all too depressing.”

Texto completo: Last year, inspired by a re-reading of John Steinbeck's classic, Travels with Charley: In Search of America, I took Albie, the oldest of my three rescue dogs, for a 9,200 mile drive around the country.
We, too, went in search of America. The phrase is both romantic and evocative. Steinbeck used it. Simon and Garfunkel sang it, though with a slightly different twist: "They've all come to look for America."
Maybe people go in search of Belarus or Brazil or Botswana, but at least to our American ears it doesn't have the romance and allure of the idea of going in search of America.
Why do so many of us, and we met quite a few on our own journey, go off in search of a place that's right beneath our feet? Hasn't it already been found? What are we looking for? What is it about these four words that has inspired generation after generation of travelers to take to America's highways and byways, and some of its best writers to do the same? It wasn't just Steinbeck, but Bill Bryson in The Lost Continent, William Least Heat Moon in Blue Highways and, of course, Jack Kerouac in On the Road, to name just a few.
"In search of America" resonates, I think, for two reasons. First, what we speak of when we talk about going in search of America is not a physical place, or a government, or a thing. We go off in search of something intangible: an understanding of the place we call home. America may be the only country in the world that is also an abstraction, an ideal (always just beyond our grasp), and an idea, an idea that took shape in the minds of perhaps the greatest collection of political thinkers ever to assemble in one place at one time -- revolutionary America. Because America evolves, because we are always in pursuit of that more perfect union, it is always waiting to be discovered anew.
This notion, that America is far more than a place on the map, was reflected in something Ronald Reagan said in his last speech as president: "America represents something universal in the human spirit. I received a letter not long ago from a man who said, 'You can go to Japan to live, but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a Frenchman. You can go to live in Germany or Turkey, and you won't become a German or a Turk.' But...'Anybody from any corner of the world can come to America to live and become an American.'"
And that's the second reason the phrase "in search of America" resonates so powerfully. It is rooted in our common immigrant experience. Unless you are a full blooded Native American, your ancestors came in search of America, and a better life, whether they arrived on The Mayflower, fled war ravaged Europe in the Twentieth Century, or walked a thousand miles from Central America to escape violence and poverty in the Twenty-first. Some, of course, came against their will, on slave ships, and were not searching for America; but their descendants, too, became part of the American quilt. The notion that anyone can become an American is under assault these days; we would do well to remember the sentiment in Reagan's words for immigration is how America has renewed and refreshed itself for centuries.
In my own search for America I found a country seemingly less at odds with itself than one would be led to believe by watching the twenty-four news cycle on cable or arguing with strangers on social media (guilty). Even in the reddest parts of America, this son of one of the bluest corners of the country encountered friendly, helpful, welcoming people.
At a coffee shop in Bismarck I met Louis F., a Marine Corp veteran, traveling the country for more than two years by bicycle. Political polar opposites we nevertheless talked pleasantly and without rancor about the country we both love. Turns out that face to face it's harder to scream at one another than it is on Facebook; not impossible, but harder.
In Woody Guthrie's hometown of Okemah, Oklahoma, a deeply conservative place, Albie and I practically became honorary citizens within hours of our arrival. People appreciated our interest in their hometown and in their stories. There is a reservoir of fundamental decency out there. We need to make sure it doesn't run dry.
Peter Zheutlin is the New York Times best-selling author of eight books. He will be speaking at the 38th Annual Steinbeck Festival in Salinas, CA on August 3 about his forthcoming book, The Dog Went Over the Mountain: Travels with Albie: An American Journey (Pegasus Books).

Texto completo: The eyes, and pencil,
of a child
I peered at the small black and white television with every ounce of attention I could muster. It was very late on a school night, well after bedtime. But this 12-year-old was glued to the TV, surrounded by family, as we shared moments like none other. What we were staring at was happening, right now, on the moon. The MOON!
I was sitting on the floor in my pajamas, mesmerized by the unfathomable. And yet there it was. It was a scene I wanted to remember forever. So I did what any child of the 1960s would do: I found a piece of paper and a pencil and began to draw what I saw.
The lunar module, in the pitch dark on a flickering screen, stared silently back. Soon, we would see astronauts bounce down the ladder to put humanity's first footprints on the lunar surface. We witnessed "one small step" and felt "one giant leap."
As technology has swiftly advanced, that unprecedented achievement now seems even more remarkable and resonates still. And that spontaneous sketch, five decades later, reaffirms that a picture is worth a thousand words - particularly when experienced through the eyes, and the pencil, of a child.
Bernard Kavaler, West Hartford
When the astronauts came to Pearl Harbor
I was a lieutenant in the Submarine Force stationed in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. We watched the moon landings in a TV room in Lockwood Hall, the bachelor officer quarters for submarine officers on Pearl.
My major comment at the time was how great it was to actually see a TV transmission from the moon, so we could all watch the astronauts go about their activities.
When Apollo 11 landed, the aircraft carrier that picked them up docked at Pearl Harbor, and the astronauts in their isolation trailer made a tour of the Pearl Harbor base before they were loaded aboard a C-130 for the flight back to Houston.
It was awe inspiring to see Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin, who waved to us through their window in the trailer. It was great to be a spectator to history.
Bill Sheehan, Waterford
Long journeys
We have no idea how we came to be at Jack Dempsey's restaurant in New York City, sitting at the bar, on July 20, 1969. But my then-girlfriend, Donna, and I have the exact same memory, so it must be true.
It's a puzzler, because she was just starting as a flight attendant at Pan Am, and I think I was about to go back to college in Washington, D.C., and start my job as a copy boy at The New York Times.
But somehow, there we were on that day, reveling in the moment as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the surface of the moon and uttered those unforgettable 12 words.
We both had vague memories of Sputnik, and for each of us, aviation and aerospace remained part of our lives for many years. I worked for a company with deep roots in the Space Shuttle and other rocket and aircraft programs, and Donna went into corporate aviation.
Those two 20-somethings at the bar that day split up for 20-something years before getting back together. But that's a story for another day.
Scott Brinckerhoff, Haddam
Moon news from
Fenway Park
I was 9 years old on the day of the moon landing, and my family had had tickets to see a Red Sox game at Fenway Park.
During the afternoon game, on a beautiful hot sunny day, the announcer shared the news that the Eagle had landed. Everyone in the park stood and applauded in what I remember as probably the most patriotic moment of my life.
After the game, we were caught in a huge traffic jam on the highway, and we were all worried we would miss the first steps live on TV. Thankfully, the moon walk was delayed a bit, and we managed to make it home in time to see those scratchy black and white images of the first steps on the moon.
That day remains one of the most vivid memories of my childhood.
Bruce Mayer, Tolland
It began with
'one small step'
As a young boy, "The Eagle has landed" felt like the definitive statement that, even against impossible odds and some failures to boot, we can do what we dream. That's an important thing to believe at age 12.
From a wider view, one country at one particular time left the planet and made the universe our stomping ground. No matter how far we may go, it happened first with that "one small step."
The Rev. Bill Keane, Branford

Texto completo: Women who have toiled to become coaches in the National Basketball Association resent being defined by their gender. They're coaches, not "female coaches" ["It's 'coach,' not 'female coach,' " Sports, July 16]. I get that, probably because I'm a woman who has written seven biographies, all New York Times No. 1 bestsellers, including books that dealt with the presidencies of John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Yet I'm dismissed as a "celebrity biographer," usually by men, who have appropriated for themselves the lofty title of "presidential historians." (Hello, Jon Meacham.)
C'mon, guys. Get over yourselves.

Texto completo: Journal reporter Angela Kocherga has been named a 2019 winner of the Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia Journalism School, which honors outstanding reporting in Latin America and the Caribbean.
Kocherga has dedicated her 30-year career to reporting on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. Her recent reporting has covered the conditions of children and families in U.S. migrant detention centers, how New Mexico cities have responded to an influx of migrants and the complex asylum process. She has also previously reported on border drug cartel wars.
“Kocherga set the record straight when politicians tried to dehumanize a new surge of migrants,” Columbia Journalism School said in the awards announcement. “At a time when United States policy calls for building walls, her reporting serves to build understanding.”
Kocherga, based in El Paso and Las Cruces, has been a Journal reporter for two years.
Her “8 hours on the border” series earlier this year with photographer Roberto E. Rosales showcased the fact that asylum seekers crossing the border were immediately turning themselves in to Border Patrol officers. Previously, the practice had been for people crossing the border to flee agents.
“It was a revelation for many of our readers to see first-hand what was truly occurring on our southern border,” said Journal editor Karen Moses. “Angela's even-handed reporting shows the trauma and challenges facing the families seeking to improve their lives and the impact their arrival has had on border communities.”
Prior to joining the Journal, Kocherga was a broadcast television journalist in Texas and Mexico. She was the bureau chief in Mexico City and later the border bureau chief for a group of U.S. television stations. Kocherga also taught border reporting at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism at Arizona State University.
“It's so important to include all the voices, like migrants, local communities affected by policy and Border Patrol agents,” Kocherga said. “There's no substitute for on-the-ground reporting on both sides of the border. There is so much rhetoric out there. It's important to show our readers the reality of what's happening on the border.”
The Cabot Prizes are the oldest international journalism awards. They honor journalists whose work promotes inter-American understanding. The other Maria Moors Cabot Prize honorees this year include political cartoonist Pedro Xavier Molina from Nicaragua, Boris Muñoz of The New York Times en Español, and Marcela Turati, a journalist and author in Mexico.
Columbia University President Lee Bollinger will present honorees with a gold medal and a $5,000 prize at a ceremony on the campus in October.

Texto completo: The New York Times, Washington Post, Salt Lake Tribune, CNN, NBC, CBS, ABC and yes, even FOX, et al. Don’t you understand what just happened?
Donald Trump was getting killed by all the coverage of his southern border concentration camps. Picture Mike Pence trying to maintain his proclaimed Christianity while observing the hundreds of immigrants standing shoulder-to-shoulder, tightly fenced with no room to sleep, defecate or even brush their teeth.
Time for a diversion, says Trump. Attack “the squad” with outrageous statements about their Americanism, then tell them to “go home.” Voila! All news coverage moved to decry yet another sign of this demented president.
Since his attack, nonstop coverage of this racially charged tirade. Zero coverage of the ongoing border tragedy.
Does the Trump base care? Please don’t allow them to laugh him into a second term.

High-alkaline vodka launches in Austin

Texto completo: In Austin, there exists a curious dichotomy: We are both fitness-conscious and booze-loving and, no doubt, we try to find balance when we want both. One new local product aims to provide just that through the use of high-alkaline water.
Fix Vodka launches this month as the boozy brainchild of Ethan and Maryn Miklas, two Austinites who noticed the city’s focus on health and created Fix to match the lifestyle here, Maryn said. It’s the first high-alkaline vodka made in the U.S. of which the founders are aware.
Water is key to the distillation process, and the Miklases were careful about the water they sourced to make the corn-based vodka. The water comes straight from Texas aquifers and has both the desired high pH and a high mineral content before it’s filtered 10 times through organic coconut-husk charcoal. That filtration doesn’t eliminate the high alkaline quality of the water, which is present in the finished vodka.
Maryn claims high alkalinity in food and drink is good for teeth and gut health, unlike food and drink high in acid. The pH scale, running from 0 to 14, measures how acidic or basic a substance is, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Most vodkas tend to have a pH of 4, which is on the acidic side; Fix’s pH is higher than 8, so it’s more on the basic side.
Because the water’s high alkalinity was acquired naturally — through minerals picked up in the aquifers that Fix sourced from — the co-founders claim it won’t fade over time. (Water can have alkalinity added to it through an ionizing process, as well.)
The high-alkaline trend is not new. Though brands such as Essentia, which has been bottling high-alkaline water since 1998, claim health benefits that range from better hydration to helping with acid reflux, “there’s no evidence that drinking water with a higher pH can change the pH of your body, or even that this outcome would provide benefits,” according to a 2018 New York Times article exploring the efficacy of high alkalinity in drinking water.
One registered dietician quoted in a CNN article from January said that more research needs to be done to determine the possible effects of high-alkaline water on the human body, as much of the research already out there has been animal-based.
“Whether you drink or consume a highly acidic or highly alkaline food or beverage, it’s going to be neutralized, especially in your digestive system, before it hits your bloodstream,” Malina Malkani, the registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told CNN.
The Miklases think Austin will be especially receptive to Fix’s mission, making it a good city to launch the brand before expanding elsewhere around Texas.
“We came to Austin 3 years ago because it is such a healthy city,” Maryn said. “Everyone is super active and it’s easy to be a part of a community of people who enjoy the same lifestyle as us — workout by day, cocktails by night.”
Maryn has long been aware of the purported benefits of high alkalinity in food and drink and first came up with the idea for Fix — so named because it could “maybe help people fix themselves a little in the process” — when she was living in California a decade ago.
“I was living the classic Cali lifestyle of daily workouts and a high-alkaline diet mixed with lots of late nights out,” she said. “I was a huge vodka fan and said to one of my girlfriends, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if there was a vodka that is better for you?’ Fast forward, and the better-for-you vodka became Fix Vodka.”
Whatever the case, Fix Vodka has a clean, neutral flavor profile that will go well with tonic water and lime or as a base in more complex cocktails with fruit juices. It’s 80 proof and available at both bars and restaurants and retailers, including Barton Springs Saloon, Black Sheep Lodge, ABC Liquor and the Austin Shaker, at a suggested retail price of $29.99.

Texto completo: The explosive debut of a new book on the fight over Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh is proving the power of word of mouth campaigns.
51LyFpiPZeL._SX329_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg
Ignored by big media outlets that often shun conservative books, Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court nonetheless has become an Amazon and Apple best seller and this weekend debuts at No. 3 on the New York Times nonfiction best seller list.
Co-author Mollie Hemingway told Secrets today, “The New York Times' first mention of our exhaustively reported and heavily researched book about the most important thing that happened to the country last year was when they had to place us on their best seller list. It is a sad reminder that many in the media are not interested in journalism but progressive advocacy.”
Fellow co-author Carrie Severino added, “We are thrilled that the book is not just a bestseller, but already making an impact. People are reading it and telling us about the different stories that moved them or shocked them. There is still a real hunger out there to understand what happened during the national circus that was the Kavanaugh confirmation and how to prevent it in the future.”
Their book is an insider’s account of the battle over Kavanaugh and details much of the backroom fighting over his nomination which saw liberals jump on false accusations of misconduct when Kavanaugh was a teen.

Publishing insiders said that both authors have manned their own PR operation to get the word out because major media outlets like CNN, MSNBC, AP, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and CBS ignored it.
The duo conducted over 100 interviews to win attention for the Regnery Publishing book, receiving over 60 articles written about it.
It is a typical story, however, for some conservative books. For example, conservative talk show host Mark Levin’s latest, Unfreedom of the Press, was also ignored by media big shots, but debuted as the New York Times No. 1 best seller.

Former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens dies at 99

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – John Paul Stevens, the bow- tied, independent- thinking, Republican-nominated justice who unexpectedly emerged as the Supreme Court’s leading liberal, died Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, after suffering a stroke Monday. He was 99.
During nearly 35 years on the court, Stevens stood for the freedom and dignity of individuals, be they students or immigrants or prisoners. He acted to limit the death penalty, squelch official prayer in schools, establish gay rights, promote racial equality and preserve legal abortion. He protected the rights of crime suspects and illegal immigrants facing deportation.
He influenced fellow justices to give foreign terrorism suspects held for years at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, naval base the right to plead for their release in U.S. courts.
Stevens served more than twice the average tenure for a justice, and was only the second to mark his 90th birthday on the high court. From his appointment by President Gerald Ford in 1975 through his retirement in June 2010, he shaped decisions that touched countless aspects of American life.
“He brought to our bench an inimitable blend of kindness, humility, wisdom and independence. His unrelenting commitment to justice has left us a better nation,” Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement.
He remained an active writer and speaker into his late 90s, surprising some when he came out against Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation following Kavanaugh’s angry denial of sexual assault allegations. Stevens wrote an autobiography, “The Making of a Justice: My First 94 Years,” that was released just after his 99th birthday in April 2019.
At first considered a centrist, Stevens came to be seen as a lion of liberalism. But he rejected that characterization.
“I don’t think of myself as a liberal at all,” Stevens told The New York Times in 2007. “I think as part of my general politics, I’m pretty darn conservative.”
The way Stevens saw it, he held to the same ground, but the court had shifted steadily to the right over the decades, creating the illusion that he was moving leftward.
He did change his views on some issues, however. He morphed from a critic of affirmative action to a supporter, and came to believe the death penalty was wrong.
His legal reasoning was often described as unpredictable or idiosyncratic, especially in his early years on the court. He was a prolific writer of separate opinions laying out his own thinking, whether he agreed or disagreed with the majority’s ruling. Yet Stevens didn’t consider his methods novel. He tended toward a case-by-case approach, avoided sweeping judicial philosophies, and stayed mindful of precedent.

Jews who called out Ocasio-Cortez weigh in on detention centers

Texto completo: At least five American Jewish organizations and two public figures think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was wrong to compare migrant detention centers on the southern border to concentration camps.
But how did they weigh in on the conditions at the detention centers themselves?
A little background: A few weeks ago, Ocasio-Cortez, the freshman Democratic New York congresswoman, tweeted "This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying."
The tweet got a lot of people talking about how we talk about the detention centers. People on the right said Ocasio-Cortez was trivializing the Holocaust by calling the facilities "concentration camps." Some nonpartisan Jewish groups warned about the use of Holocaust analogies in political discourse.
Her defenders, including a large number of scholars and left-wing activists, said that "concentration camps" had a wider applicability than the death camps at Auschwitz or Treblinka, and that the crowded, inhumane conditions merited use of the term.
And still others argued that the debate over nomenclature was a distraction from the real issue, which is how migrants are being treated in detention facilities. A government report found that across five detention centers, children were going without showers and hot food, and had few clean clothes. The Trump administration has contested a New York Times report that migrant children were being held in a Clint, Texas facility where disease, hunger and overcrowding were rampant.
Here's a rundown of the Jewish groups that criticized Ocasio-Cortez, what they said about her comment, and what they said about the detention centers.
Republican Jewish Coalition
What they said about AOC: "Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust. It is disgraceful for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to compare our nation's immigration policies to the horrors carried out by the Nazis."
What they said about the detention centers: "We are horrified and angry about the conditions and we appreciate that Speaker Pelosi finally relented and supported the Senate bill to fund humanitarian relief," RJC said in a statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Previously, the Senate approved $4.6 billion in emergency humanitarian aid for the border over Democrats' objections that it included too much funding for enforcement and not enough for improving conditions at the detention facilities.
Anti-Defamation League
What they said about AOC: "Almost exactly one year ago, we urged caution when drawing comparisons to the Holocaust and reiterated our opposition to the horrible conditions separating families at the border," tweeted Jonathan Greenblatt, national director of the organization combating anti-Semitism. "This resonates just as strongly today."
What they said about the detention centers: On July 3, Greenblatt linked to an article about the government report and tweeted: "The pictures and details in this report are startling. It's inhumane, period. @DHSgov must end this cruelty immediately."
Simon Wiesenthal Center
What they said about AOC: "It's an insult to the victims of the Shoah to make blatant false comparisons," Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Holocaust research organization, told Jewish Insider. "Stop casting Trump as a latter-day Nazi scheming to build concentration camps. AOC and all Congressmen from both parties have a moral obligation to fix the humanitarian disaster at the border."
What they said about the detention centers: In a statement to JTA, Cooper acknowledged a "humanitarian crisis" and pivoted back to Ocasio-Cortez: "Americans are compassionate people and understand that there is a humanitarian crisis at the border, but no matter how many times Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez evokes Holocaust imagery, it is appalling and unacceptable... The need for laws that address border security while reflecting Americans' history of compassion and our democracy's historic values could not be more dire."
National Council of Young Israel
What they said about AOC: "Making references to concentration camps in that context minimizes the atrocities of the Holocaust and cheapens the memories of the countless Jews who perished in those horrific camps," Farley Weiss, president of the right-wing Orthodox synagogue organization, wrote in a letter. "There is simply no comparison with what happened in these concentration camps with what is occurring at the border."
What they said about the detention centers: "There's too many conflicting reports on it," Weiss told JTA. "We want everyone to have basic access to cleanliness and being able to brush teeth and things of that nature."
The Coalition for Jewish Values
What they said about AOC: "Concentration camps were places where Nazis inflicted slave labor, torture and death upon innocent Jews removed from their homes at gunpoint and transported there in cattle cars," said Rabbi Avrohom Gordimer of the right-wing Orthodox rabbis' group. "To use Holocaust terminology regarding the refugee situation at the border is deeply offensive."
What they said about the detention centers: "We have no first-hand knowledge and there are multiple conflicting reports, so we can't comment," Rabbi Yaakov Menken, the group's spokesman, told JTA.
Deborah Lipstadt, Emory University professor and Holocaust scholar
What she said about AOC and the detention centers: In one tweet on June 24, Lipstadt condemned both Ocasio-Cortez's language and the conditions at the centers.
"Talk about the horrific conditions & not historical analogies," she wrote. "Don't give those who are behind this policy a chance to piously claim they are being wrongly accused. Use of Holocaust analogies to condemn U.S. immigration policy is a distraction."
David Wolpe, leading Conservative rabbi
What he said about AOC: "It is baffling why someone would choose a term to condemn cruelty that is guaranteed to make the argument about the term and not about the policy," he told Jewish Insider. "Analogies that evoke the Holocaust are, with the rarest of exceptions, presumptively offensive and unwise."
What he said about the detention centers: "It's appalling and it's unthinkable for the United States to treat people - whether they're admitted or not to the country - in such a manner, and all of us should be better than that," he told JTA. "If you can't unite as a country to prevent the suffering of children then we're in just abominable and disgraceful shape."
Wolpe's Los Angeles synagogue, Sinai Temple, has organized to provide supplies to migrants detained at the border.

Texto completo: Even before President Donald Trump's racist tweets toward four Democratic congresswomen of color, Americans considered race relations in the United States to be generally bad - and said that Trump has been making them worse.
On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the congresswomen should go back to the "broken and crime infested countries they came from, despite the fact that all are American citizens and three were born in the U.S.
Since his election, polling has shown Americans wary of Trump when it comes to race. But views of the president, racism in the U.S. and what defines American culture vary significantly based on political alignment.
What polls show:

In January, a CBS News poll found nearly 6 in 10 Americans saying race relations in the country are generally bad.
It wasn't always that way. Positive views of the state of race relations in the country peaked with President Barack Obama's inauguration, after which 66% of Americans said race relations were generally good in an April 2009 CBS News/New York Times poll. But views started to sour in 2014 following a number of high-profile shootings of black men by police officers and have continued to be more negative than positive in the Trump era.
And Americans think Trump is contributing to the problem. A Pew Research Center poll earlier this year showed 56% of Americans saying Trump has made race relations worse.
Americans gave similarly poor assessments of the president's impact on specific racial, ethnic and religious minorities. Nearly 6 in 10 considered Trump's actions to be bad for Hispanics and Muslims, and about half said they were bad for African Americans, according to a February 2018 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research .
That poll also found that 57% of Americans considered Trump to be racist.
Race as political fault line
Polls show stark differences in assessments of the state of race relations and Trump's impact by party identification, along with racial and ethnic identity and educational attainment.
In Pew's poll, fully 84% of Democrats said Trump has worsened race relations, while only about 2 in 10 Republicans agreed. About a third of Republicans said Trump has made progress toward improving race relations, while a quarter said he has tried but failed.
Majorities of Americans who are black, Hispanic and Asian said Trump has made race relations worse, compared with about half of white Americans. Among white Americans, views diverged by education - 64% of whites with a college degree think Trump has worsened race relations, compared with 41% of those without.
Racist language
Democrats in Congress immediately called out the president's comments on Sunday as racist and divisive, while many Republicans have remained silent.
Polling shows Democratic and Republican Americans fundamentally disagree on the way people should approach offensive language in the country.
Eighty-two percent of Republicans feel that too many people are easily offended over language today, according to a poll conducted in May by Pew Research Center , compared with about half as many Democrats who said the same. A majority of Democrats said people need to be more careful with their language.
Since Trump's election, most Americans think it has become more common for people to express racist views, and 45% said it has become more acceptable as well, according to Pew's February poll.
Majorities of Democrats said it has become both more common and more acceptable. Among Republicans, 42% said it has become more common and 22% said it has become more acceptable.
America's identity
Throughout his presidency, Trump has stoked racial and ethnic division building on his campaign promise to secure the border and country. In 2017, Trump instituted a travel ban restricting entry into the U.S. for people from five predominantly Muslim countries. Earlier this year, the president declared a national emergency to appropriate billions of dollars in funds from government agencies to expand the U.S.-Mexico border wall. And most recently, Trump moved on Monday to halt protections for most Central American asylum seekers.
Trump's response to the firestorm signaled that he thinks it's a winning stance for him. "It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me, Trump said.
In an AP-NORC poll from February 2017 , half of Americans said the mixing of culture and values from around the world is an important part of America's identity. Fewer - about a third - said the same of a culture established by early European immigrants.
But partisans were divided over these aspects of the nation's identity. Nearly half of Republicans, but just about a quarter of Democrats, saw the culture of early European immigrants as important. By comparison, about two-thirds of Democrats, and about a third of Republicans, considered the mixing of world cultures important to the country's identity.
The AP-NORC poll also found 57% of Americans saying that the U.S. should be a country with an essential culture that immigrants adopt when they come. Eight in 10 Republicans preferred immigrants to the U.S. adapt to an American culture, though a similar share said they thought recent immigrants have not done so.

'In 20 minutes, I'll know if we've lost it': The heroic decision that saved Notre Dame

Texto completo: The intense fire burning atop Notre Dame in Paris forced firefighters to make a last-minute decision to risk their lives in order to save centuries-old cathedral.
Bad timing, poor judgment, and a series of unforced errors combined to put the cathedral in crisis on April 15 when a fire ignited beneath the church’s roof, supported by hundreds of old, dry beams known as "the forest," according to the New York Times.
Emergency officials received the first call that Notre Dame was burning about half an hour after the first warning went off in the church. An archaic alert system, a new employee working a double shift, and miscommunication hindered the emergency response almost to the point of no return, and firefighters first arrived on scene after flames had engulfed Notre Dame's roof and were threatening its iconic spire.
Attempts to combat the inferno from the ground fell pitifully short. Master Cpl. Myriam Chudzinski, 27, led the first group of firefighters up to the roof of Notre Dame to fight the fire on even ground. Chudzinski was on the roof when the 750-ton spire fell, sending a fireball that likely would have killed her had she not been standing behind a wall.
Chudzinski's team descended from the roof after making little headway. The fire spread to the cathedral’s South Tower, which contains a latticework of beams holding up heavy bells. Firefighters recognized that should the fire cause the bells to fall, the thousands of pounds of bronze tumbling down would bring the tower with them.
The cathedral's survival hinged on the South Tower remaining standing, fire officials concluded. As the situation grew worse, Paris fire chief Gen. Jean-Claude Gallet, 54, decided to send a team back up the cathedral.
"There was a feeling that there was something bigger than life at stake … and that Notre-Dame could be lost," said Ariel Weil, mayor of the Fourth Arrondissement. Notre Dame stands in Weil's section of Paris.
"[Gallet] came in and told us, 'In 20 minutes, I'll know if we’ve lost it,'" Weil said, recalling a meeting between Paris’s head firefighter and various French officials, including President Emmanuel Macron. "The air was so thick. But we knew what he meant: He meant Notre Dame could collapse."
A team of firefighters ascended the cathedral’s North Tower and set up on a landing between the two towers. Some worked on dousing the flames in the South Tower while the others focused on keeping the inferno on the roof at bay. Despite the danger, the team of firefighters did not have a safe escape route if the South Tower collapsed — the team worked its way up into the South Tower to put out the flames among the beams.
"She is saved," said Gen. Jean-Marie Gontier, Gallet's deputy, after inspecting the South Tower from the church's upper landing.Story URLPhoto Caption:Flames and smoke rise as the spire on Notre Dame cathedral collapses in Paris, Monday, April 15, 2019.

One Time at Commie Camp... China's dictator heads to the beach. Meanwhile, a New York Times columnist gets nervous about 2020.

Texto completo: Chinese tyrant Xi Jinping is going to the beach to ponder a response to President Donald Trump's tariff diplomacy. A crucial question for Mr. Xi is whether he's going to have to deal with Mr. Trump for another five and a half years. In the U.S., even many Trump opponents suspect the answer is yes.
Bloomberg reports that the leaders of China's Communist party are once again headed to their annual gathering to plot strategy and enjoy the summer weather in the northern Chinese resort town of Beidaihe:
China's so-called summer capital... each year plays host to a conclave of party luminaries including President Xi Jinping, his top aides, as well as retired leaders. While the meeting's agenda, guest list and exact dates are shrouded in secrecy, there are indications that events are already underway...
This year's gathering, which likely won't be joined by Xi and other sitting state leaders until early next month, may bear even closer watching than usual as China faces growing risks at home and abroad. Beidaihe's mid-August conclusion has in the past heralded policy moves, with leaders this year likely to discuss the slowing economy, the simmering U.S. trade war and plans to mark seven decades of party rule over the People's Republic of China.
There was one time at this "secretive summer camp" when the results of the gathering were so horrific that not even Alyson Hannigan could have mined any humor from it. According to Bloomberg:
The Beidaihe tradition dates to the earliest days of Mao Zedong's reign, when party patriarchs used to swim in the sea with their bodyguards. For instance, the decisions that led to Mao's Great Leap Forward -- an aggressive push to develop industrial power that resulted in widespread famine -- were made there in 1958.
Ominously, China once again has a dictator-for-life. According to Bloomberg, this makes some wonder whether such leadership gatherings are even necessary if one man is calling every significant shot:
Xi's consolidation of party power, including writing his status as China's "core" leader into the constitution last year, has raised questions about the need for the summer meetings. The Liaowang Institute, a think tank affiliated with the official Xinhua News Agency, wrote in 2015 that Beidaihe was "gradually losing its political color and returning to its original role as a health resort in the northern China."
Here's hoping Mr. Xi decides to leave the people of Hong Kong alone and to make trade peace with the United States. Along the way, he can stop pretending that intellectual property protections are simply too difficult for him to move through China's sham legislature.

Gray Lady with a Hint of Orange? The secret ballot is a cherished treasure of the American republic, and in 2020 it might even allow a New York Times columnist to vote for Donald Trump. Timesman Thomas Friedman recently came upon a shocking discovery regarding the President's potential 2020 rivals:
I'm struck at how many people have come up to me recently and said, "Trump's going to get re-elected, isn't he?" And in each case, when I drilled down to ask why, I bumped into the Democratic presidential debates in June. I think a lot of Americans were shocked by some of the things they heard there. I was.
I was shocked that so many candidates in the party whose nominee I was planning to support want to get rid of the private health insurance covering some 250 million Americans and have "Medicare for all" instead. I think we should strengthen Obamacare and eventually add a public option.
I was shocked that so many were ready to decriminalize illegal entry into our country. I think people should have to ring the doorbell before they enter my house or my country.
I was shocked at all those hands raised in support of providing comprehensive health coverage to undocumented immigrants. I think promises we've made to our fellow Americans should take priority, like to veterans in need of better health care.
To be fair, chances are low that a material number of Timesfolk will feel compelled to vote for Mr. Trump in order to prevent the U.S. from extending free insurance coverage to all of humanity. But running to the left of New York Times columnists is typically not the path to U.S. electoral success.
***
Speaking of the Leftward Lurch Underlining the distance the Democratic party has lately travelled, a government-run "public option" for health insurance now embraced by Joe Biden was rejected as too radical even by some Senate liberals when Mr. Biden served as vice president.
Ten years ago Sen. Joe Lieberman explained his opposition to the Journal's Kimberley A. Strassel:
"I'm being more stubborn and certain about this . . . I think it's such a significant step for the country to create another entitlement program and to have the government going into a business, I feel like I've got to say no."
...Why is he adamant? Mr. Lieberman says that while he is not "a conspiratorial person," he believes the public option is intended as a way for the government to take over health care. "I've been working for health-care reform in different ways since I arrived here," he says. "It was always about how do we make the system more efficient and less costly, and how do we expand coverage to people who can't afford it, and how do we adopt some consumer protections from the insurance companies . . . So where did this public option come from?" It was barely a blip, he says, in last year's presidential campaign.
"I started to ask some of my colleagues in the Democratic caucus, privately, and two of them said "some in our caucus, and some outside in interest groups, after the president won such a great victory and there were more Democrats in the Senate and the House, said this is the moment to go for single payer.'"
...Mr. Lieberman notes that the public option serves no other purpose: "It doesn't help one poor person get insurance who doesn't have it now. It doesn't compel one insurance company to provide insurance to somebody who has an illness. And . . . it doesn't do anything to reduce the cost of insurance."
Mr. Lieberman dismisses Democratic arguments that it is necessary to keep insurers honest. "Sometimes the private sector does things that are wrong, and when they do, you regulate -- sometimes you litigate," he says. "But never in the history of America . . . have we tried to keep one industry honest by having government go into that business to compete with the industry."
Shocking as it may be to Mr. Friedman, no one at the Times or anywhere else should expect private health plans to survive the rise of a "public option" in U.S. insurance.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SUITS 9 p.m. on USA Network. This long-running legal drama begins its ninth and final season. Since the departure of Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), his wife, Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle), and the law firm's head honcho, Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) in Season 7, fans have watched the series mainstays, Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht), Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty) vie for control of the firm. And while the Duchess of Sussex will in all likelihood not be back, fans can expect to see Adams return as a guest star in the show's final 10 episodes.
PEARSON 10 p.m. on USA Network. As "Suits" embarks on its final season, one of the show's characters finds footing in her own spinoff. Ms. Torres reprises her role as Jessica Pearson, a former top lawyer who's now working as a political fixer for the new mayor of Chicago, played by the actor Morgan Spector. In an interview in The New York Times, Ms. Torres opened up about her character's new chapter. "What I love about the new show is that we actually get to go behind the scenes to see what in fact motivates Jessica," she said. "She really is interested in using her very specific skill set for good. How she gets there is questionable."
What's Streaming
BABYLON (1980) Stream on Criterion Channel; Rent on YouTube and Google Play. Despite having its debut at Cannes over four decades ago, this film, which offers an unflinching look at daily life for black people in South London in the '80s, was just released in America last March. The film follows Blue (Brinsley Forde), a young mechanic who's steeped in the local reggae scene, and the racism and poverty that he encounters in Brixton at that time. In his review for the Times, Wesley Morris wrote, "The movie arrived with an X rating, which, in Britain, was basically like an R. But it ensured that the young black people whom 'Babylon' was primarily made for wouldn't have been let into a theater to see it."
BLOWN AWAY Stream on Netflix. If you get nervous watching people construct delicate baked goods in the summer heat on "The Great British Baking Show," then this new Netflix competition show will send your stress levels soaring. This series brings together 10 masters of the niche art of glassblowing, where they compete for a chance to win $ 60,000 in prizes. To stay in the race, they have to work under pressure to create intricate glass robots, realistic-looking glass body parts and colorful botanical-themed sculptures that will impress the judges. It's like "Top Chef" meets "Forged in Fire," History's bladesmithing reality show, and the art is mesmerizing to watch.

Texto completo: Gran desconcierto y temor generó el anuncio de grandes redadas de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ) en 10 ciudades, a comenzar el 14 de julio, pero hasta ahora no hay reportes de capturas masivas.
Los planes de la agencia se modificaron, según The New York Times, debido a la cobertura mediática.
“Los planes para la operación se modificaron en el último minuto, después de que los informes de noticias dijeron a las comunidades de inmigrantes sobre qué esperar” , indicó el diario.
Sin embargo, un alto funcionario de inmigración confirmó a CNN que la lista de ciudades e individuos objetivo sigue siendo la misma y podría impactar al menos a 2,000 familias; agregó que la movilización comenzó el sábado y se extenderá a otras ciudades sin precisar, además de que los operativos se harían discretamente.
“No esperaría una gran movilización que coincida con la histeria que hemos escuchado en los últimos días” , dijo el funcionario.
Los operativos se programaron en Atlanta , Baltimore , Chicago , Denver , Houston , Los Ángeles , Miami , Nueva Orleans, Nueva York y San Francisco , zonas donde se concentra el mayor número de inmigrantes legales e indocumentados.
IMPORTANTE: Los 5 principales consejos para enfrentar redadas de ICE
Defensores y activistas han reportado las tácticas que ICE podría estar utilizando para lograr las capturas.
“Puedo confirmar. ICE fue a la casa de un cliente vistiendo camisas que decían ‘POLICÍA'” , indicó el abogador Aaron Reichlin-Melnick . “Le mostraron a su sobrina adolescente una foto de un hombre al azar que, según dijeron, había robado la identidad de su tío y la hizo llamarlo para que regresara a casa. Cuando llegó a casa, lo detuvieron frente a ella. Ella estaba traumatizada”.
Can confirm. ICE went a client's home wearing shirts that said "POLICE."
They showed his teenage niece a picture of a random man they said had stolen her uncle's identity and had her call him to come home.
When he got home they arrested him in front of her. She was traumatized. https://t.co/3aDtacM8pj

También se destaca que los agentes migratorios podrían estar esperando a sus objetivos fuera de sus viviendas, para evitar alertarlos y lograr capturarlos.
“Los agentes de ICE deben esperar a que sus objetivos salgan de sus hogares voluntariamente para arrestarlos” , indica Daniel Nichanian, miembro de la organización The Justice Collaborative. “Usan tácticas como llevar fotos de señuelos, mostrarlas por las ventanas… simulando estar buscando a alguien más”.
Cabe destacar que ICE nunca especifica cómo, cuándo y dónde realiza sus operativos contra inmigrantes, pero sus propios reportes de diversas movilizaciones indican que movilizaciones nacionales, como el que ocurre en 10 grandes ciudades del país , pueden tardar mínimo tres días o incluso semanas.

Texto completo: A handful of Texas Republicans in Congress admonished President Donald Trump for a series of Sunday tweets in which he told four members of Congress — three born in the U.S. and all American citizens — to “go back” to the countries they came from, even as Trump doubled down on his comments Monday.
“POTUS was wrong to say any American citizen, whether in Congress or not, has any ‘home’ besides the U.S.,” U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, who lives just outside Austin in Hays County, said in a tweet Sunday night.
Republican U.S. Reps. Will Hurd of Helotes, a longtime thorn in the president's side on border security
issues, and Pete Olson of Sugar Land, who has been more hesitant to criticize the president, delivered stronger rebukes.
In an interview Monday on CNN, Hurd called the tweets “racist,” “xenophobic” and “unbecoming of the leader of the free world.”
On Twitter, Olson called on Trump to “immediately disavow his comments” and added that the tweets were “not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas (District) 22.”
Their comments were notable because most Republicans remained silent on the topic, even as Democrats, including the objects of Trump’s ire, spoke forcefully against him.
At a news conference late Monday afternoon, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., blasted Trump’s “blatantly racist attack on four duly elected members” and called for his impeachment.
“This is the agenda of white nationalists,” said Omar, who was born in Somalia and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, “whether it is happening in chat rooms or it is happening on national TV, and now it’s reached the White House garden.”
She was joined by Democratic U.S. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, the targets of Trump’s tweets over two days.
Ocasio-Cortez said that Trump “does not know how to defend his policies, so what he does is attack us personally, and that is what this is all about.” She added that “no matter what the president says,” the country “belongs to everyone.”
“I encourage the American people, and all of us in this room and beyond, to not take the bait,” Pressley said. “This is simply a disruption and a distraction from the callous, chaotic and corrupt culture of this administration.”
During the news conference, Trump continued the showdown with the congresswomen, tweeting, “The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four ‘progressives,’ but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!”
At an earlier appearance at the White House, Trump said that “a lot of people love” what he tweeted Sunday. “If you’re not happy in the U.S., if you’re complaining all the time, you can leave; you can leave right now,” Trump said.
That followed several Monday morning tweets in which Trump, reacting to calls for an apology, attempted to turn the tables on the Democrats.
“When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!” read one tweet. Roy, a freshman who is a former aide to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and hasn’t been shy about criticizing both Democrats and Republicans, retweeted that Trump tweet, seemingly in an attempt to hedge his criticism of the president.
Like Roy, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of the president, walked a fine line between criticizing the president and commiserating with him.
Graham advised Trump to “aim higher” in an interview on “Fox and Friends,” even as he added, “We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of communists. They hate Israel. They hate our own country.”
U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told a Politico reporter Monday afternoon that the tweets were a “mistake” and “an unforced error” but did not elaborate.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced Monday that the House would hold a vote on a resolution condemning Trump’s comments. The Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, said Democrats will force a vote in the Senate.

We need to be greater than 'just OK'

Texto completo: Maybe President Trump was right that we needed a "Salute to America" last week, because apparently some Americans have lost sight of the greatness of our country. Case in point: To mark Independence Day, The New York Times posted a video op-ed challenging what it called the "mythology" of American greatness. "America may once have been the greatest," the Times video declares, "but today, America, we're just OK."
The video is like a caricature of how conservatives think the left sees America — except it isn't a caricature; it's real. It's a straw man come to life.
As evidence we're just OK, the video cites statistics showing that other developed countries, such as Luxembourg, Sweden and Norway, have lower poverty rates or better education and health care than America. And as for our "kick-ass democracy," the Times says, it's not that big a deal because "a lot of countries have freedoms."
The fact is, all the freedom those other countries enjoy would not be possible without the United States.
The reason that "a lot of countries have freedoms" today is because our Founding Fathers pioneered the principle of popular sovereignty, where governments answer to the people instead of the other way around. At the time of our founding, the rest of the world was ruled by monarchs.
Our founders established the first country in human history that was built on an idea— the idea of human liberty.
That dramatic explosion of freedom didn't just happen. It was the direct result of the rise of the United States as a global superpower. The U.S.-powered victory over Nazi tyranny in World War II and our triumph over Soviet tyranny in the Cold War defeated the hateful ideologies of fascism and communism, and unleashed a wave of freedom that has spread across the world. Today, 4.1 billion people live in democracies. (Of those who do not, four out of five live in China.)
None of that would be possible without the Pax Americana guaranteed by U.S. military. Americans liberated a continent, rebuilt much of it from the rubble of war with the Marshall Plan, and then stood watch on freedom's frontier and prevented a Soviet tank invasion across the Fulda Gap. Today, the only thing that stops North Korea from invading South Korea or China from invading Taiwan is American military might.
So, let's be clear: Every country that enjoys democratic governance today owes its birth of freedom to our Founding Fathers, and the continued existence of their democracy to the U.S. military.
Today, for all its flaws, America remains the freest, most innovative, most prosperous country in the history of the world. We invented the light bulb and the iPhone. We put a man on the moon and a rover on Mars. We are a nation of unparalleled military power and unlimited opportunity.
There's a reason we have a crisis on our southern border; millions want to come here so that they can share in the abundance of American prosperity. Trump was right to shine a spotlight on our men and women in uniform and to remind those who have lost sight of it that the United States is not simply the greatest nation on Earth; we are indispensable. Without us, the world would be mired in the darkness of totalitarianism rather than the light of liberty. That is better than "just OK."

Texto completo: A CNN panel tried to get former Republican Rep. Mia Love to label as racist President Trump's tweets suggesting that liberal members of Congress go back to their home country on Monday morning.
In a three-tweet thread Sunday, the president advised that Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York , Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts go back to their countries of origin to help them if they are unhappy with the United States.
Love was on New Day to discuss the tweets alongside New York Times’ journalist Frank Bruni and CNN contributor Bianna Golodryga.
“Just to be clear, do you see those tweets as racist?” Alisyn Camerota asked Love.
"Racist is a very — I take that word incredibly seriously. I don’t — I’m not in the president’s head. I do not think that these comments help," she answered. "I am not going to get into whether he is racist. I don’t think that those comments help him. I don’t think that the comments help his narrative. I’m incredibly frustrated, I continue to be frustrated."
CNN panel urges Mia Love to call Trump's tweets racist
“Let's stop dancing around this issue, it's a racist comment. It's a racist comment any time somebody says go back to the country from which you came,” Golodryga, who is an immigrant, responded.
"Mia Love said she’s frustrated, Republicans are frustrated, I’m frustrated with that interview. All due respect, I have no idea why she’s dancing around calling these comments racist. She’s no longer in Congress and still seems unwilling to call out the president’s behavior for what it is. Those were racist — no, please, my turn, those were racist Tweets," Bruni argued.
"Republicans aren’t running away from that tweet or comments in the tweet because they are icky, they are being silent because they fear if they cross Donald Trump he will make it difficult for them to get re-elected. This is a pure political calculation," she continued.
"I see the bigger issue here. The bigger issue to me is when I go out and see how the world views us, I see the world looking at us tearing each other apart. I’m sorry, don’t tell me how I should feel about what somebody says about me because I have grown up as a black woman in America my entire life," Love shot back. "I have been taught that I will not allow anyone make me a victim."Story URLPhoto Caption:Surrounded by her family, Rep.

Texto completo: It would seem that the band of young progressives in Congress driving the Democratic Party to the left have struck a chord in American politics.
Our Question of the Week for readers: Is it a symphonic G major, or a flat discord?
Even the Executive Branch Tweeter in Chief seems to be fascinated by the group.
Are especially the members of “The Squad” — the four young women members of Congress President Trump told to “go back” to ancestral home countries over the weekend — creating important new policy discussions that will add oomph to the Democrats’ brand?
Or are they a danger to their party, increasing the chances that Trump will easily be re-elected by an American people worried about radicalism under the banner of “democratic socialism”?
In a recent New York Times interview, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was fairly critical of The Squad, which is made up of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-New York, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minnesota and Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Massachusetts.
The irony of course is that Pelosi has long been viewed by many Americans as a stalwart liberal from elitist San Francisco. If she is instead the leader of the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, does that mean the center cannot hold?
The four were the only Democrats to vote against the House version of a border funding bill backed by Pelosi. The speaker angrily said they had supporters in “their Twitter world” but not on Capitol Hill.
But after the racially tinged tweets from the president, Pelosi spoke out in support of her junior colleagues.
Some note that The Squad and other newly elected House Democrats are really more representative through their youth of the Millennial generation than of their ethnic backgrounds.
Will they energize young people who haven’t been involved in the political process before? Will they bring to the polls some minority voters who stayed out of the Hillary Clinton-Trump election in 2016?

La estrategia racial de Trump del “ellos contra nosotros” está más viva que nunca

Texto completo: El domingo, el presidente Donald J. Trump conminó a congresistas demócratas progresistas a regresar “a los países infestados de crimen de donde vinieron”. Aunque Trump no las nombra, se refería a las cuatro congresistas electas en los comicios intermedios de 2018: Alexandria Ocasio Cortés, nacida en Nueva York y de ascendencia puertorriqueña; Ayana Pressley, de Massachusetts; Ilhan Omar, de Minnesota; y Rashida Tlaib, de Michigan. Solo Omar es inmigrante y llegó aquí como refugiada de Somalia a los 10 años de edad. Es ciudadana estadounidense.
Es obvio que para Trump ser estadounidense equivale a ser blanco. Y es esa premisa la que mueve su estrategia de campaña, ahora de reelección, así como su estrategia política y sus decisiones de política pública, especialmente en materia migratoria. De hecho, Trump lleva semanas anunciando el inicio de redadas en varias ciudades del país para detener a inmigrantes con órdenes finales de deportación, acción que para Trump es un capítulo más del reality show que es su presidencia, para infligir terror entre la comunidad inmigrante y demostrar ante sus seguidores que está cumpliéndoles lo prometido. De hecho, para garantizarles que su plan de promover división guiará su campaña de reelección.
No hay que olvidar que fue Trump quien encabezó la campaña que cuestionó la ciudadanía estadounidense del expresidente Barack Obama afirmando que había nacido en Kenia, como su padre, y no en Hawaii.
Trump no dudó en atacar a un senador federal, luego candidato y luego presidente estadounidense, abogado constitucionalista egresado de Harvard y nacido en Hawaii de madre estadounidense y padre africano. El domingo afirmó que las congresistas demócratas progresistas deben “regresar” a los países de “donde vinieron”, aunque ese país sea Estados Unidos. “Regrésate a tu país” es la frase preferida de los prejuiciosos, y muchos hemos sido el objetivo, sobre todo al hablar español en público, aunque seamos ciudadanos estadounidenses. ¿Qué pueden esperar entonces los inmigrantes al interior del país y los migrantes que arriban a la frontera o que ya están detenidos y hacinados en condiciones infrahumanas?
Si su gobierno ni siquiera tiene compasión con niños y bebés migrantes detenidos en insalubres condiciones documentadas por el Inspector General del propio Departamento de Seguridad Interna (DHS), ¿hay quien todavía ponga en duda que el único objetivo de Trump es explotar políticamente la divisiva estrategia de “ellos contra nosotros” cimentada en el nativismo, el prejuicio y el racismo?
Y claro está, sus cómplices le siguen el juego. Solo hay que remitirse a la visita del vicepresidente Mike Pence a la frontera el pasado viernes. Mientras las cámaras de la prensa que cubre al vicepresidente mostraron las terribles condiciones de hacinamiento e insalubridad y los propios reporteros indicaron que la pestilencia era abrumadora y que incluso algunos agentes portaban máscaras debido al mal olor, Pence trató de minimizar las condiciones y, claro está, culpó a los demócratas por la falta de fondos para abordar la crisis. Incluso tachó de “deshonesto” un video de CNN del hacinamiento.
Solo había que ver el rostro de Pence al observar a los migrantes enjaulados. Parecía que quería salir corriendo. Pero tenía que completar la visita para hacer creer que hay compasión, cuando en realidad Trump está utilizando la crisis humanitaria con fines electorales. La imagen de rostros morenos hacinados le sirve a Trump en sus planes de promover miedo y prejuicio entre sus huestes.
Que Trump lo haga, a nadie sorprende, pero la hipocresía del evangélico Pence es indignante aunque no sorprendente. La prensa reportó que Pence también visitó un centro de detención de niños migrantes acompañado de su esposa y de tres senadores republicanos, Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur; Mike Lee, de Utah, y John Cornyn, de Texas.
The New York Times reportó que Lee le sirvió de intérprete a Pence, quien les preguntó si tenían comida y cuidados, a lo que los niños respondieron que sí. “Pero cuando les preguntó si tenían un lugar para asearse”, los niños movieron la cabeza en señal de no, según el diario.
“Dos niños le dijeron al Señor Pence que habían caminado por dos o tres meses para llegar a Estados Unidos, a lo que Pence respondió en inglés ‘God bless you’, y ‘gracias’ en español”, reportó The New York Times.
Me pregunto dónde Pence esconde su Biblia y los preceptos religiosos que tanto defiende, cuando le hace el trabajo sucio a Trump. Pence cumplió su cometido y dio la espalda al problema.
Pero el daño infligido, sobre todo el daño psicológico a los niños, ya está hecho.
Porque si algo ha demostrado Trump y su gobierno es que la crueldad y el prejuicio no tienen límites, así se trate de niños, o de expresidentes, o de congresistas que no llenen el molde racial que el presidente defiende. La estrategia electoral del “ellos (los de color) contra nosotros (los blancos)”, sigue vivita y coleando en los planes de reelección de Trump.

Texto completo: Cities across the country braced for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that began as early as Saturday, but local officials said Sunday that there was still no sign of ICE activity in Connecticut.
On Sunday, Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin said that he and his office had not heard of any ICE raids being conducted in the city.
Laurence Grotheer, the director of communications for New Haven Mayor Toni Harp's office, also said Sunday that no ICE activity had been reported there.
Although neither Bronin nor Harp had expected their cities to be targeted in the nationwide raids, Bronin's office issued a statement Friday directing residents to WeHaveRights.US and to the state's Family Preparedness Plan for families concerned about immigration enforcement.
"We do not have any indication that these raids will be taking place in Hartford, but we want our residents to know their rights," Bronin said. "Targeting families, including potentially families with children who are citizens, will do nothing to make our country safer - it will make us weaker."
In a statement issued Friday, Harp also said the raids seemed designed to stoke fear. However, Harp said that New Haven has an "open-arms tradition for those fleeing oppression in other countries."
"New Haven policies remain unchanged regarding immigration," Harp said. "This city is not trained, equipped, nor interested in helping enforce inconsistent federal immigration standards."
This weekend's immigration raids were initially forecast for mid- to late-June, according to a June 17 tweet from President Donald Trump.
However, the original timeline was delayed by two weeks.
Then, on July 11, the New York Times reported that the raids were set to begin Sunday and would target at least 2,000 immigrants.
The raids were reportedly aimed at individuals who had been ordered deported, but enforcement was designed to also include "collateral" deportations of immigrants found at raid scenes.
The operation was reported to include 10 major U.S. cities, including Baltimore, Chicago, Miami and New York City.
But reports on actual enforcement were mixed through the weekend.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted Saturday morning that "unsuccessful ICE enforcement actions" had been taken in the city, even though raids weren't set to begin until Sunday.
Meanwhile, some of the cities supposedly in ICE's cross-hairs seemed to have unexpectedly calm weekends. The Chicago Tribune reported Sunday afternoon that the city's streets were tense and quiet - but hadn't yet seen any raids.
Although Connecticut was not listed among the areas expected to be targeted this weekend, local officials still prepped for potential ICE activity.
Bronin, Gov. Ned Lamont and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., all spoke at news conferences and rallies Friday, where they denounced the raids and told residents how to get help if they encountered ICE officials.
On Friday, Blumenthal touted a new bill that would further protect special sites - such as schools, hospitals, courthouses and places of worship - from immigration enforcement.
"These raids are looming right now and are very predictable in major cities like Bridgeport or Hartford," Blumenthal said Friday. "They are likely to be more selective, less visible and dramatic, but ICE is out there under orders to do these arrests, and they've been doing them."
While Hartford looked to remain unaffected by the nationwide raids, Bronin said in a Friday statement that the enforcement would have a negative impact on the country as a whole.
"President Trump's apparent decision to move forward with these raids targeting families is shameful, it's a waste of resources, and it's designed to create fear - not make America stronger," Bronin said.

China's Economic Growth Slows as Trade War Stings

Texto completo: BEIJING -- China's growth fell to its slowest pace in nearly three decades, officials said on Monday, as a resurgence of trade tensions with the United States and lingering financial problems take an increasing toll on one of the world's most vital economic engines.
Chinese officials said the economy grew 6.2 percent between April and June compared with a year earlier. While such economic growth would be the envy of most of the world, it represented the slowest pace in China since the beginning of modern quarterly record-keeping in 1992. That marks a significant slowdown from earlier this year, when growth came in at 6.4 percent, matching a 27-year low reached during the global financial crisis a decade ago.
Premier Li Keqiang set a target in March for economic growth to be between 6 and 6.5 percent this year. The figures on Monday fell within that range.
But much of the growth in the quarter may have taken place in April and early May, when public confidence was higher because of a tax cut in March and heavy infrastructure spending as spring began. Trade talks broke down on May 10 and President Trump raised tariffs sharply on Chinese goods, a step that damaged consumer confidence within China. Growth early in the quarter also would have taken place before the contentious government takeover of a bank in late May hurt financial confidence.
Chinese officials on Monday acknowledged that conditions are becoming increasingly difficult.
"Economic conditions are still severe both at home and abroad, the global economic growth is slowing down, the external instabilities and uncertainties are increasing, the unbalanced and inadequate development at home is still acute, and the economy is under new downward pressure," said Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for China's National Bureau of Statistics, in a news conference.
Mr. Mao downplayed the effects of trade, saying China's economy increasingly relies on consumption.
Monthly economic data, particularly for imports, suggests that the second quarter started strong but then slowed. "There was certainly a surge in activity through April," said George Magnus, a longtime specialist in the Chinese economy who is now at Oxford University. "Something happened in May."
The number may also understate the extent of the slowdown. Economists widely doubt the veracity of the overall Chinese growth figure, which shows far more stability than comparable numbers from the United States and elsewhere.
A few sectors of the Chinese economy are doing fairly well. The strongest sector appears to be the construction of infrastructure, much of it paid for with money borrowed by local, provincial and national government agencies. Retail sales ticked up as well.
The biggest drag on the Chinese economy lies in trade, which grew powerfully over the past three decades but has stopped rising in recent months. Exports dipped 1.3 percent in June from a year earlier, the government said on Friday, and imports fell 7.3 percent.
While the trade war has hurt American purchases from China, economic weakness in Europe and many Asian countries has caused overseas demand to weaken far more broadly than just in the United States. Last week, Singapore unexpectedly announced that its trade-dependent economy had shrunk at an annualized rate of 3.4 percent in the second quarter.
"The economy is definitely in a broad decelerating trend because the global economy is slowing down, so exports are slowing down," said Larry Hu, the chief China economist at Macquarie Capital, the investment banking unit of a big Australian multinational.
China's troubles have their roots not just in trade but also in a debt-laden financial system that has been shaken by a series of large shocks in the last few weeks.
On May 24, Chinese financial regulators took over Baoshang Bank in Inner Mongolia, a small institution that is part of a financial empire previously controlled by Xiao Jianhua, a financier who disappeared into the custody of government investigators two years ago. Regulators tried to force a few of its largest creditors to accept losses rather than bailing them out as a way to teach financiers to be more careful about where they put their institutions' money.
Problems in some of the shadowy corners of China's financial system have also frightened investors. China's shadow banking system plays an important role in funding property projects and other private business ventures. But managers of some riskier investment products have had a hard time making high-interest payments to investors in recent weeks. In some cases they have also had trouble even repaying principal.
These incidents have set off a broader shift in recent weeks away from riskier investments. Institutions and households alike have been putting money into larger, more stable financial institutions run by the central government.
Big state-controlled banks have steered the bulk of their lending to state-owned enterprises. That long-running trend has hurt the real estate market and the broader private sector.
Regulators have repeatedly urged the big banks to lend more to small businesses and the private sector, and Mr. Li, the premier, did so again on July 2. But these exhortations have had limited effect so far. Bank lending officers worry that they might be blamed, or even investigated for corruption, if they extend large loans to struggling private businesses that then default as the economy weakens.
Andrew Collier, the managing director and founder of Orient Capital Research, a Hong Kong investment and economic research firm, said that troubles at Baoshang and in the shadow banking system had rattled financial markets but seemed to have been contained, at least so far.
"The Chinese central bank is watching carefully, and for now will use quiet means to avoid any shaky financial shenanigans," he said.
Economists are watching for other potential warning signs, like inflation. Price increases have been tame, according to official statistics. But many in China complain that the actual cost of living is rising fast, particularly for food but also for rent and other daily expenses.
Industrial production has weakened this year, as has private sector investment. Housing sales have slowed, as buyers look harder for bargains but sellers have been reluctant to cut prices. Car factories have sharply reduced output in response to weak sales, although there were signs last month that consumer interest in buying luxury automobiles may finally be stabilizing.
The long-running trade war has prompted many multinational companies to look at ways to shift supply chains elsewhere. But many continue to invest in China to supply China's own market as well as others, especially in Asia.
"The Chinese government will continue to work hard to create a more stable, fair, transparent and predictable investment environment," Gao Feng, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, said at a news briefing on Thursday.
He later added that "China has not experienced large-scale withdrawals of foreign capital."
For now, though, the economy keeps running to a considerable extent because the Chinese government is pumping huge sums of money into infrastructure. It is building high-speed rail lines, immense highway bridges, ports and other facilities to connect ever smaller and less affluent cities and towns to the rest of the country. That infrastructure is making it easier to do business and move around even in some of the poorest and most remote areas of China. But bankers and economists worry about whether some of these investments will ever earn enough of a return to cover their cost.
"There's a very weak commercial basis," Mr. Magnus said, "for this credit-fueled infrastructure spending."

Protesters Target Station Thought to Be Pro-Beijing

Texto completo: HONG KONG -- As a television journalist was trying to record video of a protest in Hong Kong last week, the protest suddenly became about him -- and his employer.
Surrounding him, the young demonstrators waved signs in front of his camera that read "Change channels!" They also held up bottles of Pocari Sweat, a sports drink that has become an unlikely symbol of disdain for his news station, Television Broadcasts, better known as TVB.
TVB, Hong Kong's dominant broadcaster, has been singled out for scorn by protesters, who accuse it of a pro-Beijing bias in its coverage of the political crisis roiling this semiautonomous Chinese region.
Analysts say TVB's reporting has largely focused on how the protests have disrupted Hong Kong's famed efficiency, while playing down the political frustrations that have driven people to the streets in large numbers.
The tension between the demonstrators and the station, whose broadcasts reach about 70 percent of Hong Kong's population, touches on concerns that the city's status as a regional bastion for press freedom is being steadily undermined by the Communist Party in China, where media controls are strict.
"It is a notorious television station and it always doesn't show comprehensive facts," said Cheuk Ka-ho, 21, a university student who is active in the protest movement. "We feel that over the years it has gotten worse as it keeps getting closer to China."
The protests began in early June, when hundreds of thousands marched against legislation that would allow extradition to the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, has since suspended the bill indefinitely, but protesters, including on Sunday, have continued to demand its full withdrawal, Mrs. Lam's resignation and an independent inquiry into what they consider a brutal police response to some of the protests.
On July 1, some demonstrators escalated the conflict by storming, vandalizing and briefly occupying the Hong Kong legislature.
[A New York Times visual investigation suggests the police used excessive force in handling a previous protest.]
In TVB, protesters have found another front in their battle for Hong Kong's future. They have organized boycotts of the network on social media and lobbied companies to withdraw advertisements from it.
The confrontation on Wednesday, when the TVB journalist was surrounded, was not an isolated incident. Last month, protesters heckled another TVB video journalist, unfurling umbrellas to block his camera and chanting, "TVB news, selling out the people of Hong Kong!"
The protesters accuse the broadcaster, which has a virtual monopoly on free-to-air TV rights in Hong Kong, and a senior executive who was once a top Communist Party official in Shanghai of deliberately marginalizing their movement, a charge that TVB rejects.
A Facebook group calling for boycotts of TVB has drawn more than 30,000 followers, and a petition criticizing the station has collected 100,000 signatures. Last week, the maker of Pocari Sweat, a Japanese sports drink popular in Hong Kong, pulled its advertising from TVB.
TVB has defended its coverage as accurate and impartial and accused protesters of threatening its advertising clients.
"Pocari Sweat's comments are designed to please protesters, which equals to bowing to violence," the broadcaster said to a Chinese nationalist tabloid, Global Times, in comments that TVB verified as accurate.
A spokeswoman for TVB declined an interview request. But in a statement last month, the station said it was deeply regrettable that TVB reporters had been prevented from doing their jobs.
Hong Kong's media landscape has become something of a battleground for the social divisions exposed by the political crisis, which could widen as the mass protests continue.
On one side is, essentially, TVB's core demographic: older, conservative Hong Kong residents, who tend to sympathize with the police and see the protesters as troublemakers. At a rally in support of the police in late June, some demonstrators assaulted journalists from other local news outlets.
On the other side is a younger group, generally supportive of the protest movement and the pro-democracy politicians who are a minority in the local legislature. For them, TVB's coverage confirms longstanding fears about Beijing's growing influence over local affairs.
Some critics refer to TVB as "CCTV-B," a mocking reference to China Central Television, Beijing's main broadcaster of domestic propaganda. They point to TVB's vice chairman, Li Ruigang, a media mogul from mainland China and one-time senior Communist Party official in Shanghai, as evidence of Beijing's sway over the station. (Mr. Li's company, China Media Capital Group, did not respond to a request for comment, but he has previously rejected such suggestions.)
The Hong Kong Journalists Association reported last year that mainland Chinese interests had direct control over, or stakes in, nine of Hong Kong's 26 mainstream media companies, including TVB, up from eight a year earlier.
"Even though ownership is not concentrated in just a few hands, most of them have the same boss: the Communist Party," Allan Au, a former TVB journalist who is now a media studies expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said of the city's pro-establishment media barons.
Ever since Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control in 1997, under a formula known as "one country, two systems" that promised a high degree of autonomy from Beijing, the city has distinguished itself from the mainland partly by nurturing the independence of its institutions, including the news media.
While the encroachment of Chinese interests has raised concerns, Hong Kong's media landscape, to be sure, is still relatively free. Its journalists are among Asia's most combative, known to shout sharply worded questions at top city officials. Journalist groups have publicly opposed the extradition bill and accused the police of using excessive force against reporters who were covering protests.
TVB, for its part, has been less overtly antagonistic toward the protest movement than the city's two pro-Beijing newspapers, Wen Wei Po and Ta Kung Pao. But compared to news outlets with a pro-democracy bent, like the newspaper Apple Daily and the online platform Stand News, it has generally been skeptical of the protesters.
The network "focuses very much on disruptive behavior rather than on what they asked for, what they really want and what's behind that motivation," said Gary Tang, a media studies expert at Hang Seng University in Hong Kong, referring to the protesters.
Critics note that TVB was the television outlet Mrs. Lam chose for an interview last month in which she compared dealing with the protesters to her own experience as a mother with a willful child -- an analogy that enraged many of the demonstrators. On July 2, when TVB covered the aftermath of the storming of the legislature, it focused on the damage to the building and, unlike other news outlets, barely discussed the protesters' demands.
Mr. Au said TVB's closeness to mainland China was evident in the amount of airtime it devoted to reports about, for instance, President Xi Jinping's so-called Belt and Road Initiative of international trade and infrastructure links, at the expense of other types of reporting.
"This is by design: The serious reporters don't have enough resources and time to devote to serious journalism," Mr. Au said. "This is what I call 'structural censorship' that confines the content without explicit censorship."
Privately, some of the network's reporters and former staff members say they have felt caught in the middle. They are sympathetic to the protesters but resent being targeted over coverage decisions they say were made by their superiors.
"Protesters accuse TVB of brainwashing its loyal audience," said Lam Yin-bong, a former TVB reporter who now works for Stand News. "But these reporters and cameramen think: 'First, I'm on your side, and second, even if I'm not, I'm just doing my work in a professional manner."'
"They would think: 'This is not my fault, so why are you targeting me?"' he said.

Texto completo: (Update on July 14: Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo reported no large-scale deportation operations in the city Sunday.)
U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee met with faith leaders in Houston on Saturday to invite undocumented immigrants to seek refuge in churches, mosques and synagogues and call on religious organizations to open their doors ahead of Sunday’s anticipated deportation roundup by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
“It is to my dismay that I have to come home to find many of those who live in my jurisdiction, my constituency, are panicked, frightened and in fear of their lives,” said Jackson Lee, a Houston Democrat. “I say to the federal authorities that you are well aware and on notice that you are not able to come into a church and demand anyone that is a representative of the faith to give anyone to anyone.”
Jackson Lee gathered with faith and local leaders Saturday afternoon at the Living Water International Apostolic Ministries in Houston. The ministry, along with half a dozen other churches, announced it would shelter undocumented immigrants Sunday who fear they are in danger of being taken by ICE.
“We want to be a beacon of light for those who may be in fear. So when I got the call, I couldn't do anything but accept,” said apostle Robert Stearns, leader of Living Water. “There is nothing strange to us in doing this. This is our heart and our passion.”
Immigrant communities in Houston and cities across the country have been preparing in the past week for the deportation raids that federal officials say will start Sunday. The operation will target some 2,000 undocumented immigrants. The New York Times reported this week that the raids could also include “collateral” deportations — the removal of undocumented immigrants that were not the target of the raids but happen to be there when they happen.
ICE officers are, technically, allowed to enter "sensitive locations" such as churches, schools and hospitals but generally try to avoid doing so.
"Enforcement actions may occur at sensitive locations in limited circumstances, but will generally be avoided," according to the ICE website. "ICE officers and agents may conduct an enforcement action at a sensitive location if there are exigent circumstances, if other law enforcement actions have led officers to a sensitive location, or with prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official."
It is not clear if the churches will face legal consequences for sheltering undocumented immigrants from deportation. Stearns, with Living Water, said his church is not trying to break the law, but rather do what it believes to be right.
"We need the president to understand that there are some areas that we’re duty bound to do," Stearns said. "We’re just trying to sustain those who need to be sustained until Congress and him can get some things together and get some things sorted out."
Jackson Lee's office did not immediately respond to questions about potential legal repercussions.
Cesar Espinosa is the executive director of Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en La Lucha, a group that advocates for immigrants and social justice in Houston. Espinosa said many immigrants are fearing for their lives and safety ahead of Sunday and could be looking for a place of refuge.
“As long as we can remember, the church has always been a sanctuary for people who are fleeing persecution,” Espinosa said.
Texas Republicans have continually criticized Democrats' stance on the border crisis and deportation operations. On Saturday, U.S. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Houston Republican, tweeted what he called a summary of Democrats' immigration plan: no border wall, no asylum reform, decriminalization of improper border crossings and not enforcing deportation orders.
"Seriously, ask yourself: is that your position?" Crenshaw wrote. "Most Americans say no."

Texto completo: THE Marathon LPGA Classic presented by Dana at Highland Meadows Golf Club in Sylvania with a $1.75 million purse ends today. The Ladies Professional Golf Association tournament is so much more than seeing world class pros in action, although that is the focus. The event brings people together, from the hundreds of volunteers, community leaders and business supporters, to the thousands of spectators.

The week started with Pro-Ams sponsored by businesses at Highland Meadows, Toledo Country Club and Sylvania Country Club where many men vied for the opportunity to hit the links with one of the Pro Women golfers.

There was also the third annual Women's Summit presented by Owens Corning "Chipping Away at Unconscious Bias," a seminar about diversity and inclusion. Emcee Diane Larson of WTVG-TV, Channel 13, welcomed the 400 women and a couple of men into the Champion's Pavilion with chandeliers and pink and yellow decor. The well run event, which raised $100,000 for charity, was organized by chairman Meg Ressner with oodles of sponsors.

Keynote speaker Yassmin Abdel-Magied, Sudanese born author, broadcaster, and advocate for the empowerment of women, young people, and people of color, presented awareness's of biases with humor, using examples of her career as a female engineer.

A panel led by Shanda Gore, Mays and Assoc., featured successes in spite of biases that were used as positive tools rather than obstacles. Amy Hall, Ebony Construction president; Bina Joe, University of Toledo scientist; Muziet Shata, Mercy Health's diversity and inclusion; and the lone male of the group, Jaime de la Cruz, Marathon Petroleum Company's organizational capability, all recommended breathing before reacting.

Roberta Bowman, chief brand and communications officer who came out of retirement to help the LPGA and LPGA golfer Lizette Salas, spoke about their accomplishments while dealing with unconscious biases, too. Seated yoga by Leslie Chapman, Toledo Yoga and Margaret Penn, Yogaja tied in with mindfulness as did mind exercises by Chad Johnson of Marathon Petroleum.

Parting gifts included a New York Times best seller, Blind Spot: Hidden Biases of Good People by Mahzarin R. Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald.

The tournaments kickoff celebration, 19th Hole Party presented by ProMedica and Owens Illinois Inc. was at Huntington Center Tuesday night.( since this was in Thursday do we need to repeat?)

Today, if you go to The Marathon Classic, know that there were hundreds of sponsors to help make it all happen including The Blade, Buckeye Broadband, Fifth Third Bank, HydroChemPSC, Hylant, KeyBank, Kroger, McDonald's Restaurants of NW Ohio and SE Michigan; Mercy Health, Pepsi Beverages Co., ProMedica, The University of Toledo Medical Center, Willy's Salsa and Yark Subaru.

The Champions Pavilion, the Sky Box, the Club House and the 14th hole's Labatt Blue Light Party Deck and the Chamber Canteen will be full of spectators who all paid extra to be there. Folks whose homes are on the links, have a great view, too. But like those with grounds passes, many will be on the links, following their favorite player. Even if you are not a golf buff, it's a great place to see and been seen while getting a nice stroll in for the day. There is also the free Putts n Pars Family Fun Zone so bring the children.

Please stay behind the ropes, watch for television cables and golf balls, do not block others views and do not talk during play of a shot or leave a green until players have holed out. Autographs are permitted before or after a round. The tournament is nationally televised on The Golf Channel in case you can't be there.

Prohibited items: Spiked golf shoes, animals except service dogs, noise producing electronics, coolers, bikes, skateboards, outside food or signs, weapons, or cameras, including cell phones, which must be silenced. But you can bring camp stools, folding chairs and umbrellas.

Playtime over for Democrats' radicals

Texto completo: It was certainly no slip of the tongue when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi cut a small group of her party's radicals to size. "All these people have the public whatever and their Twitter world," she told The New York Times. "But they didn't have any following. They're four people, and that's how many votes they got."
The issue at hand was the $4.6 billion border bill passed by Congress. The "squad" -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley -- considered it inadequate for protecting migrant children. Pelosi argued that it was the strongest bill they could get passed.
It was totally predictable that the four would go bananas over this questioning of their real power. Pelosi had stuck a pin in their balloon of self-importance, and with it, the myth of their immense following -- outside Twitter, that is.
Speaking in their defense, Hillary Clinton's former spokesman Brian Fallon said, "Those freshman members are breaking through, and they're building a movement, and the more power that movement gains, the more persuasive they will be to Pelosi." OK, Brian, when they have eight members, give us a ring.
But even if their number were to double to eight, the squad would still be a small fraction of the House's 235-member Democratic caucus. Some 30 of the newly elected Democrats took seats in Republican-leaning districts, which is where the party's "energy" really is. What's the big deal about winning in totally safe Democratic districts?
Of course, every Democratic member has the right to dissent or challenge what he or she sees as party orthodoxy. But Pelosi seems to be drawing the line at posturing considered poisonous to the party's prospects. That would include proposals seen as encouraging illegal immigration and nonstop appeals to ethnic and racial identity.
Still more aggravating are their threats to "primary" Democrats they do not deem to be sufficiently obedient. (For all their obsession with diversity, some of the squad's targets are black and Latino representatives.)
If these women are so unhappy with the Democratic Party, why don't they leave and run for reelection as democratic socialists? But they would never do that. For all their pitching of socialism -- whatever they mean by that -- they know that they can't win on the democratic socialist line. (Note how Sen. Bernie Sanders routinely slips in and out of Democratic affiliation to ensure that when it's time to vote, there's a D after his name.)
Working against efforts to contain these egos is a branch of the liberal media that inflates the importance of their every mood swing. To these reporters, all the important stuff happens on Twitter, which makes their jobs extremely easy. And if the attention-seeking tweets inflame the folks at Fox News, so much the better. Meanwhile, the hard work of other Democrats goes unnoticed.
Bear in mind that almost all these Democrats qualify as progressives. The characterization of these conflicts as liberals versus conservative moderates is lazy and unsophisticated. Until recently, Republicans portrayed Pelosi as a wild-eyed liberal from San Francisco. Her views have not radically changed.
Democrats have an opportunity in 2020 to bring home independents, never-Trumpers and no-longer-Trumpers. In doing so, they may be forced to choose between these new potential Democratic voters and appeasing some on the radical left.
That may risk another leftist attempt at sabotage similar to the Ralph Nader debacle in 2000. Back then, the left was so dissatisfied with the Democratic candidate, that famous right-winger Al Gore, it sent enough votes to Nader to hand the election to George W. Bush.
Now is the time to tell the furious four to play fair or go pound sand. Stay strong, Speaker Pelosi. American civilization is at stake.

ICE raids: Southern California not seeing stepped up enforcement

Texto completo: Jose Rodriguez stocked his food cart with fewer fresh fruit cups Sunday, figuring many in Santa Ana’s Latino community might stay home for fear of much-touted immigration raids.
But his sales were brisk.
Immigration arrests were not.
“I wasn’t expecting any crowds,” said Rodriguez, who has worked his cart at the same corner for 26 years, selling fresh fruits, cold drinks and Mexican treats. “There’s been so much fear in the community.”
That fear, for a day at least, seemed to be unfounded.
Immigration rights advocates from around the region said Sunday they hadn’t heard of any large operations by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. And while some arrests occurred in Los Angeles, Riverside and Lake Elsinore over the past few days, it’s unclear if those were related to the announced sweeps or part of typical ICE work.
President Trump this month announced, initially on Twitter, that on Sunday, July 14, ICE agents would pick up some 2,000 immigrants around the country who are living in the United States illegally and have deportation orders.
He’d made a similar claim in June, saying “millions” of people would be removed from the country. The June raids never happened.
The plan slated for Sunday would focus on criminals and recent arrivals from Central America. They could also include “collateral” arrests of people who happen to be in the area of the intended targets, according to news reports.
The publicized sweeps were supposed to take place in Los Angeles, Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Denver, Miami, New York and San Francisco. Two other cities originally on the list, Houston and New Orleans, were reportedly postponed because of tropical storm Barry.
It’s possible the raids were only delayed, not abandoned.
Instead of a large, simultaneous sweep, immigration officials created a secondary plan for a smaller and more diffuse scale of apprehensions to roll out over roughly a week, the New York Times reported Sunday. Individual ICE field offices were given the discretion to decide when to begin those sweeps.
Immigration officials have declined to say what their plans are, saying it could threaten the safety of agents and jeopardize their operation.
In Southern California, immigration arrests, they pointed out, are made every day.
“This is what we are. We are a law enforcement agency,” Lori Haley, an ICE spokeswoman based in Orange County, said Friday.
Many immigrant-rights advocates said they were not surprised by the low-key rollout of the so-called sweeps.
“I think they’ll do their usual ops today. They want that element of surprise,” said Jennaya Dunlap, deportation defense coordinator for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.
Even through 2,000 arrests or so – spread across Los Angeles and the other cities – are not necessarily unusual for ICE raids, the president’s words and the media’s coverage of his plan have created considerable anxiety, advocates said.
“It’s not about the numbers. It’s about the fear,” said Guillermo Torres, who spearheads the immigration campaigns of the Los Angeles-based Clergy & Laity United for Economic Justice.
“Words are powerful and they impact families. And that’s what this president has done, for political purposes, because he’s running for re-election,” Torres said.
In downtown Santa Ana, the number of visitors appeared typical. Some said business was a little slow, but most said it was about the same.
In other heavy Latino locations, some residents were reportedly keeping a low profile.
“We were in Lake Elsinore yesterday (Saturday, July 12,) and the stores were empty. People were telling us they don’t come out until evening,” said immigration rights advocate Dunlap.
“That’s the kind of fear people are living” with, she added.
On Sunday, Dunlap was at a swap meet in Winchester, a small town close to Hemet in Riverside County. Normally, the swap meet would be very crowded – but not this Sunday.
“We’ve come here before and given out a couple of thousand hotline cards,” Dunlap said. “But I’m standing here and literally no one is walking past.”
Another swap market that had much lower attendance Sunday was one outside Cypress College, said Anaheim resident Dariana Diaz, whose father has a stand. “People are scared of the raids.”
In Indio, Coachella and Moreno Valley, advocates noted that local supermarkets frequented by Latino customers had considerably fewer shoppers on Sunday, according to Luz Gallegos, community programs director for the Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC) Legal Center.
Yet, at least 160 people turned out Sunday for information forums in Perris, Coachella and Victorville, she said. A few attendees had deportation orders.
“People were very interested in identifying the official documents and understanding the difference between an ICE warrant and a search and seizure warrant signed by U.S. magistrate judge,” Gallegos said.
In recent weeks, starting after Trump initially tweeted about deportations, local groups have held numerous seminars, sometimes called “know your rights” forums, telling immigrants how to handle potential contact with ICE officials and how to prepare their families, legally, in case adults are removed from the country without their children.

A Global Media Sensation

Texto completo: The television news director Joel Banow absorbed endless hours of "terrible old B movies" filled with extraterrestrials and rocket ships long before he oversaw the production of an authentic space opera.
While the astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins were making history above, Mr. Banow played his part on the ground, helming the coverage of the Apollo 11 mission for CBS News while standing on his feet like an orchestra conductor.
Mr. Banow treated the 32 hours of programming on July 20 and July 21, 1969, like "a big blockbuster kind of motion picture," he said in an interview, which meant days of rehearsal, custom animation and a cast of correspondents and producers so large that the end credits lasted seven minutes.
It was one of the first global news media spectaculars. The director said he had prepared for the job by having helped with the coverage of the previous Apollo missions and several Gemini and Mercury launches.
As the Eagle module touched down on the moon, applause flared up behind Mr. Banow in the CBS News studio on West 57th Street in Manhattan. He cut to Wally Schirra, a Project Mercury astronaut working as a CBS News consultant, catching the retired spaceman in the act of wiping away a tear. Mr. Banow followed that shot with a glimpse of the network's star anchor, the usually composed Walter Cronkite, who grabbed his nose and shook his head, momentarily at a loss for words.
Hours later, at 10:56 p.m., a hazy black-and-white image flashed on the screen of Armstrong advancing gingerly down a ladder. When he stepped onto the lunar surface, Mr. Banow finally took a seat.
"I felt pride that I was a part of this, and also wonder that NASA managed to do it without a glitch," Mr. Banow, now 84, said. "They did it. We did it. It was really kind of a relief."
The coverage of the event had come about thanks to recent advances in media technology. In 1962, the first live trans-Atlantic broadcast -- showing images of the Statue of Liberty, President Kennedy and a baseball game -- was transmitted via satellite. A more ambitious live satellite broadcast, in 1967, showed the Beatles performing "All You Need Is Love" at Abbey Road Studios in London. More than 350 million people around the world were watching.
Roughly 600 million people, a fifth of the world's population, saw Armstrong set foot on the moon, a viewership record that held until Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles in 1981.
All three major American broadcast networks -- CBS, NBC and ABC -- covered the Apollo 11 mission, with CBS dominating the ratings. In the United States, 94 percent of people watching television were tuned into the event.
People who did not own TV sets or found themselves away from home kept up with the coverage from bars, town squares and department stores, said David Meerman Scott, the co-author of the 2014 book "Marketing the Moon."
Many astronauts and engineers resisted the live-broadcast plan, expressing concerns about the extra weight of the filming equipment. But at NASA's insistence, Armstrong's moonwalk was captured by a Westinghouse camera covered in a protective thermal blanket and tucked into the lunar module. The signal bounced from the module's antenna through microwave links, satellites and landlines around the world. The picture was degraded before it reached viewers.
The BBC covered the event with less reverence than its American counterparts, dubbing David Bowie's just-released single, "Space Oddity," onto the footage beamed back from the moon. During a break in the action, the BBC gave viewers about five minutes of Pink Floyd jamming live from the network's studio on a bluesy song called "Moonhead," as well as dramatic readings with a lunar theme from Ian McKellen and Judi Dench.
Networks in the United States rounded out their coverage with hours of analysis and moon-related entertainment. On ABC, the science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov chatted with Rod Serling, the creator of "The Twilight Zone" television series. The network had also commissioned Duke Ellington to create something new for the occasion. He made his television debut as a vocalist, performing the song he had composed, "Moon Maiden," live on the air.
Headline writers conveyed the news with attempts at deadline poetry. The Kokomo Tribune, in Indiana, went with "Astronauts Etch Names Beside History's Great Explorers." The Oil City Derrick, in Pennsylvania, was more succinct: "Yanks Land on Moon." The New York Times's banner headline -- the straightforward "Men Walk on Moon" -- was set in some of the largest type ever used in the paper.
The coverage of Apollo 11 was subdued in Moscow. "It was not secret, but it was not shown to the public," Sergei Khrushchev, the son of the former Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, told Scientific American in 2009.
In the United States, NASA had spent years molding its astronauts into mythic figures, giving Life magazine exclusive access as part of its attempt to shape public opinion. Americans became emotionally invested in the crew members thanks to cover stories documenting the "making of a brave man" and the "inner thoughts and worries" of the spacemen's wives.
"That had a large effect in showing how big a deal it is to go to space, and it helped to make the astronaut-as-celebrity culture come alive," Mr. Scott, the author, said. "You'd flip through magazine pages and see Joe DiMaggio, a hero of baseball, and then a few pages later, an astronaut. That's mythmaking."
For balance, Life magazine also dispatched Norman Mailer, a writer not known for pulling punches, to cover the mission. He characterized Armstrong as "wooden" and "extraordinarily remote."
The advertising industry got in on the craze, too. In one ad, Panasonic showed astronauts on the moon watching a television set under the words "Now you can watch the Russians coming even if you're 250,000 miles from home." Space-themed ads also appeared from Stouffer's, Sony, Ford, United, Motorola and other companies.
After the Apollo 11 crew members returned to Earth and emerged from quarantine, they embarked on a good-will tour of more than 20 countries. It was, according to Mr. Scott, a way to cast a warm glow over the United States during a tumultuous time, showing that the country was capable of "something positive for humanity that was completely the opposite of what was going on with the Vietnam War."
Apollo 11 went on to have a long media afterlife. MTV opened for business in 1981 with a montage of NASA images from the mission assembled by a Greenwich Village firm, Manhattan Design. The cable network still hands out trophies inspired by Apollo 11 at its annual awards ceremony.
Armstrong, an unassuming Midwesterner who once described himself as "a white-socks, pocket-protector, nerdy engineer," made an exception to his habit of avoiding media hoopla in the years after he walked on the moon by talking up Chrysler cars in a 1979 Super Bowl commercial.
The less publicity-averse Mr. Aldrin appeared in a "Transformers" movie, competed on "Dancing With the Stars" and teamed up with Snoop Dogg on a song called "Rocket Experience." He has said that being in the spotlight contributed to his divorces and years of drinking and depression. And he was less than thrilled not to receive compensation for inspiring the name of a "Toy Story" character, Buzz Lightyear.
As the years went by, conspiracy theorists claimed the moon landing was fake. A popular fantasy had it that the government had hired the director Stanley Kubrick, fresh off his film "2001: A Space Odyssey," to create mock footage on a secret set. In 2001, the Fox television network stoked doubts by airing the documentary "Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?" Famous skeptics have included the N.B.A. star Stephen Curry, who expressed his doubts in an interview last year.
NASA landed astronauts on the moon six times from 1969 to 1972. But interest had waned by the time the second team of astronauts stepped onto the lunar surface. The Times noted a "collective sense of anticlimax" at the time of the first encore mission.
There are signs that enthusiasm is building again. In 2017, a bidder paid $ 1.8 million for a sack of lunar dust filled by Armstrong. Last month, a signed photograph of the first man on the moon sold for $ 52,247.

Texto completo: Our daughters wanted to know: "Were newsrooms really like that in the 1980s?"
They had binged on Season 3 of the Netflix hit "Stranger Things," and they thought one of the strangest things of all was the way the all-male editors treated intern Nancy Wheeler.
As an earnest Wheeler flutters about the newsroom trying to fit in, the editors make sexist jokes, call her Nancy Drew, turn down her obviously good story suggestions and complain when a sandwich she delivers doesn't have mustard on it.
Yes, women put up with a lot back in the 1980s. They still do.
Over the past two years, we have interviewed nearly 100 women who made it into leadership roles in newspapers, broadcast and digital news outlets since about the 1980s. Their stories are funny and sad and hair-raising — often at the same time.
Marcy McGinnis, who began as a secretary at CBS and rose to the No. 2 job in the news division, remembers a top executive lifting her up in the middle of the newsroom and twirling her around while proclaiming, "I'd like to thank the National Organization for Women for this trophy."
Nina Totenberg sat in a part of the NPR newsroom along with several other women that was widely referred to as the "fallopian jungle."
Women were told that they couldn't work nights because it was too dangerous, and that they didn't need a raise because they had husbands who worked. They were denied promotions because male staffers didn't want to work for women.
They were told how to dress and how to speak — and when to keep quiet. And above all, they were told they should never, ever cry in the newsroom.
To get ahead they felt like they had to — if not actually be a guy — act as much like one as possible. As late as 1998, Joyce Purnick, then the metro editor of The New York Times, told students at her alma mater, Barnard College, that she would have never made it to the city desk if she had children.
Today, only five of the 25 largest newspapers have women editors (Nicole Carroll at USA TODAY is one of them). Earlier this year, CBS named Susan Zirinsky as its top news executive, the first time a woman has ever held that job. News organizations that have never had a woman in charge include ABC News and CNN. The Washington Post has never had a woman as the top editor. The only woman to ever lead The New York Times was ousted publicly and unceremoniously after one of the shortest tenures in the newspaper's history.
The situation isn't much different in any traditionally male-dominated industry. Only 33 of the top 500 publicly traded companies are led by a woman.
But the problems extend well beyond who gets the corner office. A newspaper journalists' union, NewsGuild-CWA, has been analyzing salaries at publications for several years and reports consistently finding disparities in pay between white men compared with women and people of color.
A study last year by a union representing newsroom staffers at the Los Angeles Times found that the average male reporter made about $102,000 a year while the average female reporter made about $87,564.
And, of course, the news industry has had more than its share of #MeToo moments, with dozens of powerful men who once called the shots in news being called out for flagrant sexual harassment.
Those of us who entered media organizations in the 1970s and '80s didn't expect things to be easy. We thought if we worked hard, ignored the slights, laughed off the sexual advances, stuck with it and brought other women up behind us, things would change. They did, but not nearly as much as we thought they would.
In one poignant scene in "Stranger Things," Nancy Wheeler has just been fired by those men who laughed at her, and she begins to question her worth. Her mother holds her and says, "It's not easy out there. People are always saying, 'You can't; you shouldn't; you're not smart enough; you're not good enough.' This world, it beats you up again and again until most people, they just stop trying. ... But you're not like that. You're a fighter."
We tell our daughters and the many young women we teach that they, too, must be fighters. We tell them that they will face some of the same old battles, but that they belong in newsrooms. There's a place for them. And maybe, just maybe, they can finish the job we started.

Migrant children's treatment is America's shame

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.") Border officials concede it's a crisis, albeit exaggerated by monitors and media, and they're simply overwhelmed by a 124% increase in migrants over the previous year.
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late. Housing for adults has expanded with the use of tents, and $4.6 billion in congressional funding will provide further relief.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
"Most kids will have lasting scars from what they have seen or are enduring," Harvard psychiatrist and bioethicist Wes Boyd, who has studied asylum seekers, told Axios.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Your home won't fund retirement

Texto completo: On April 5, USA TODAY reporter Paul Davidson wrote a piece on the big gains folks reaped buying starter homes as housing markets rebounded from the long 2006-11 housing crash.
Buying in low-cost suburbs, folks could upgrade to larger "forever" homes in just several years. They used starter-home gains to fund bigger down payments. It was a great financial win for young families.
It also supports one of the most controversial things I've ever said here: Owning a home is wonderful, but don't bank on real estate as your chief retirement investment.
People looking to real estate today for retirement riches often point to those big post-crisis gains. Trouble is, you can't buy past performance. And the recent past probably isn't a blueprint for the next 10, 20, 30 years or more.
After the housing bubble popped in 2006, prices tanked for five years, bottoming in 2011. Returns since that time are a near-perfect V-shaped recovery — a point that a chart in Davidson's story shows. As a general but not perfect rule, what gets hammered the hardest on the way down rebounds the strongest. Starter homes were punished most in the crash. So they rallied most in the recovery. But this bounce effect has largely matured.
Like all assets, home prices move on supply and demand. The key to both? Location, location, location.
The housing market isn't uniform nationally or even within the same city. Anyone looking to hop onto San Francisco's property ladder or other coastal hot spot knows this. Coloradoans may have scored entry-level homes for roughly $200,000 in 2012, but no such luck for would-be first-time homebuyers in Californian metropolises or New York. The cost of Silicon Valley starter homes can come close to $2 million, depending on style and neighborhood. That's your first clue real estate is a geographically fragmented game.
Even where it's cheaper to buy, eye-popping gains aren't guaranteed. If you buy where new construction is limited and job opportunities are humming, keeping supply low relative to demand, you may do very well.
But what if you buy where construction eventually outpaces job creation and population growth? What if a city is focused on one or two industries, and what if they fall from favor and fizzle? What happens to San Jose prices if tech crashes and burns? What of Houston when the energy industry hits the skids? What if your neighborhood school system takes a perceived quality dive relative to nearby communities?
Counting on real estate for your retirement nest egg is a very long-term bet on weak real estate development plus good economic fortune – both in one location.
You're betting your town will attract people with good jobs and maintain schools long-term –and that politicians will limit new development. You're betting some hot new suburb won't steal your hamlet's thunder.
Instead, if you see a home purchase as merely guaranteeing a roof over your head and protecting against rising rents, things look different. You don't shun a neighborhood because more housing construction might constrain property values. If all the jobs move, you can too, even if that means having to rent for a few years. You needn't stress about timing your purchase just right or not picking the highest-flying neighborhood. You can simply go where you and your family feel most at home –whether it's a green suburban neighborhood or a hip urban townhouse.
Homes are great. Banking on them for retirement income isn't.

After vigil, immigration advocates gather, plan

Texto completo: Hours after they attended a vigil to draw attention to migrants being housed in unsanitary camps at the US-Mexican border, immigration advocates and activists filled a sunlit Cathedral of Saint Paul in Boston on Saturday to strategize about how best to help the local immigrant community.
The diverse crowd learned about a range of national and state issues, including temporary protected status, or TPS, of immigrants to bills pending in the state Legislature, during the session organized by Boston Lights for Liberty, an advocacy group.
In small group settings, people learned how to organize demonstrations and other community actions to help immigrants cope with unyielding fear and grief about the prospect of seeing loved ones deported in raids scheduled to be carried out by federal authorities Sunday in 10 US cities.
“This is for after you light the candle," said Leah Bloom, an organizer with Boston Lights for Liberty.
Although Boston is not on the list of cities where raids are expected to be carried out, the fear of ICE raids has alarmed the immigrant communities of Massachusetts, with some choosing not to go to work and even refusing to go to the grocery store, the Globe reported Saturday.
The operation is expected to take place over multiple days in at least 10 major cities, according to The New York Times, which first reported the planned raids.
On Saturday, some shared their stories on immigrating to the United States from troubled homelands.
“I've had the opportunity to work, to drive, to live my American dream, said Doris Landaverde, a Salvadoran immigrant who arrived in 2000 and has TPS, which allows her to work and live in the United States.
In her nearly 20 years in the United States, Landaverde managed to save up enough money to buy her mother a house in their homeland, she got married, she had three daughters — who are all American citizens by birthright, and are underage. In other words, she built a life.
But when President Trump announced the end of TPS for Salvadorans in 2018, Landaverde feared for the worst, so she resolved to tell her story.
“That was a very hard process," she said in Spanish, detailing how she even went back to school to improve her English so she could “bring my story to the American community because they need to know what's happening to us."
“They need to know we're good people who come here to work, to build a family, a better future," she said. “We're not the people this government is saying — criminals."
Other speakers tried to reassure undocumented workers fearing deportation.
“Even if you're undocumented, you still have rights," said Natalícia Tracy, executive director of the Brazilian Worker Center.
Massachusetts has the second largest Brazilian population after Florida, according to a 2017 report from the Boston Planning and Development Agency, and a lot of them come from mixed-status families, Tracy said, meaning at least one member might be undocumented.
“That causes horrible fear that someone is going to get deported, family separation," she said.
“Children are afraid that their mother [or] father is going to get picked up by ICE."
Tracy, who has lived in the United States for the past 28 years, said there were a few years where she, too, was ­undocumented.
Having first arrived to work as a nanny, Tracy found herself in an untenable situation, making $25 a week for 90 hours of work, she said. The family let her paperwork expire, she said, and didn't inform her. But to Tracy, that she was unaware of her undocumented status is an example of how immigration in the United States has changed over the years.
“It was not the same as it is now," she said, later adding that “people were just people."
“We always have to deal with race in the US," Tracy said. “People always question where you're from and when you're going back, but they didn't treat you like you're a ­criminal."

Texto completo: When astronaut Neil Armstrong emerged from the spindly lunar module Eagle onto the craggy surface of the moon, he united a bitterly divided nation in a brief moment of national pride and wonder. After years of Vietnam protests, political assassinations and urban race riots, an astonishing 94 percent of all American households stayed up into the late night of July 20, 1969, to watch the miracle of Apollo 11 unfold on live TV. "That's one small step for man, and one giant leap for mankind," Armstrong radioed once his boots touched the ground. Then he and Buzz Aldrin gathered rock samples, hopped in lunar gravity and erected a camera that captured the iconic image of Aldrin saluting an American flag they fumblingly planted into the gray moonscape. Yet soon enough, moon and space station missions became routine, and public indifference and second-guessing set in. So 50 years later, what are we to make of those hazy hours of glory?
In his meticulously researched and absorbingly written book, journalist Charles Fishman provides both a celebration of the Apollo 11 mission and a corrective to some of the myths that have crystallized around it. The first involves the role of President John F. Kennedy. True, Fishman documents, it was Kennedy who in 1961 announced the goal of putting a man on the moon "before this decade is out," and who served as "our poet of space, and also our philosopher of space" in public. "We choose to go to the moon, in this decade, and do other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard," Kennedy famously declared in a speech at Rice University, after visiting the construction site of a new NASA center in Houston in September 1962.
But Fishman argues that it was all about macho Cold War politics for Kennedy, after the Soviets took the lead in sending rockets, men and dogs into space. Privately, Kennedy cooled on the project after superpower tensions eased in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis that October, and he might have dialed it back, Fishman suggests, had he lived. ("I'm not that interested in space," an exasperated Kennedy blurted out to NASA chief James Webb in a budget meeting when Webb wouldn't guarantee that $400 million could ensure a victory in the race to the moon.) Only after Kennedy's assassination did Lyndon Johnson double down on the Apollo program, and Jackie Kennedy tie her husband's name to space travel for posterity by lobbying to have the space center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., named after him.
After all the movies and memoirs focused on astronauts, Fishman skips retelling the personal stories of Armstrong, Aldrin and Michael Collins, the third Apollo 11 crew member who manned the Columbia command module. Instead, he introduces us to the scientists and engineers who made it all possible. Charles "Doc" Draper was the bow-tie-wearing ballroom-dance enthusiast who headed the MIT Instrumentation Lab, which designed the internal navigation system that allowed Apollo modules to all but pilot themselves once in flight. Bill Tindall was the talented writer and orbital mechanics "genius" from the old NASA headquarters in Langley, Va., who rode herd over the MIT scientists with more than 1,000 "Tindallgrams" in six years, mixing witty cheerleading with relentless flyspecking.
Most memorable of all, John Houbolt was the quiet, middle-aged, mid-level NASA engineer who dared to pester his superiors with long, single-spaced letters advocating a "lunar-orbit rendezvous (LOR)" - a "lunar ferry," as the New York Times first described it, that would detach as it neared the moon, then link back up with the command module for the trip home. In making his case, the lowly Houbolt was taking on the "Earth-orbit rendezvous" scenarios originally advanced by the cocky Saturn booster rocket team led by the legendary Wernher von Braun. The von Braun design, Fishman writes, "kept the astronauts close to home, so if something went wrong with the rendezvous, they could simply fire their retrorockets and return to Earth." But in a fateful meeting at the Saturn headquarters in Huntsville, Ala., in June 1962, von Braun suddenly threw his weight behind the LOR plan. Seven years later, Houbolt was invited to sit alongside von Braun in NASA's VIP viewing room. When Armstrong reported that "the Eagle has landed," von Braun turned to Houbolt. "John, it worked beautifully," he said.
To the criticism that the Apollo program was a "moondoggle" (in the words of sociologist Amitai Etzioni) and a waste of billions of dollars that could have been better spent addressing social ills at home, Fishman offers a persuasive defense. Not only did space contracts with Grumman, General Motors and other companies account for hundreds of thousands of jobs spread across all 50 states, but for almost a decade, NASA and its contractors, along with the Pentagon team building the Polaris missile, served as virtually the only buyers for Fairchild Semiconductor's integrated circuits, perfecting and driving down the price of the computer chips that now power everything from our laptops and smartphones to kitchen appliances and electronic cars. "No, Apollo didn't usher in the Space Age, but it did usher in the Digital Age," Fishman concludes. "It helped lay the foundation of the technology that created the digital revolution, and it helped give Americans a sense of excitement and anticipation about the Digital Age . . . that had been completely missing before the 1960s began."
In his final chapter, Fishman riffs on the can-do "spirit of America" that the Apollo program came to symbolize, captured in the oft-repeated phrase: "If we can send a man to the moon, then why can't we (fill in the blank)." As tempting as it would be to recommend "One Giant Leap" as a welcome diversion from our current political chaos, that meditation invites the question of what has become of that spirit in the self-dealing era of President Trump.
But Fishman rescues what could have come across as an outdated paean to American exceptionalism with a crucial caveat. "We have to be asked" if we are to accomplish hard and great things again, he writes. "We have to be rallied to the cause." In this most fractious era since the 1960s, one finishes this book wondering: Will we ever again find missions that unite and inspire us as a nation, and leaders with the vision and magnetism to point the way?
Mark Whitaker is the author of "Smoketown: The Unknown Story of the Other Great Black Renaissance." Previously, he was managing editor of CNN and editor of Newsweek.

Texto completo: The friends and enemies William Safire collected during a lifetime in political Washington silently greeted him when he ascended a narrow staircase in his Chevy Chase home and entered his office.
There, on the walls surrounding Safire's desk, were more than 1,500 books he amassed in Washington working as a speechwriter for President Richard M. Nixon, then as an op-ed writer and language columnist for the New York Times.
Henry Kissinger's titles were up there. Margaret Thatcher's. Bob Woodward's. Even Saul Bellow's. And, of course, Nixon's.
Now, a decade after Safire's death, his books - with gossipy personal inscriptions and intimate letters tucked inside - are up for sale. Capitol Hill Books, the charmingly cramped used book shop near Eastern Market, recently struck a deal with Safire's estate for the collection.
In bringing Safire's books to market, the store is revealing - and promoting - an extraordinary, sometimes cagey glimpse into the country's political and intellectual history, a throwback to the days when political enemies could attend each other's book parties and politely enjoy deviled eggs.
"That's really the fun part of this," said Aaron Beckwith, the store's co-owner. "You go down the rabbit hole and start to fill in gaps from history, and you see some pretty incredible things."
Like Nixon.
Does his strange behavior ever underwhelm? Not with his tapes. And certainly not, it turns out, with his book inscriptions.
In 1978, the disgraced ex-president published "The Memoirs of Richard Nixon." Five years earlier, the New York Times reported that Nixon authorized a "national security" wiretap on Safire while he served as a White House speechwriter. Safire then blasted Nixon in a column.
Nixon's inscription in the copy he sent Safire - sitting on his office shelf for 40 years - spun Beckwith's head.
"To Bill," Nixon wrote. "With deep appreciation for his wise counsel over the years and for his service to the nation in government and in the media. Sincerely, Richard M. Nixon."
When the store began listing the books last month, the Nixon memoirs sold almost immediately, fetching $400, well above other signed copies. So did "Diplomacy," a history of foreign relations by Kissinger, who served as Nixon's secretary of state and was a frequent target of Safire in his columns.
Safire had a curious filing system in which he often tucked letters he received from notable people in the books they wrote. A letter inside "Diplomacy," marking Safire's retirement from the Times, seems written from another planet when read in the context of today's grenade-style political combat.
"There were not a few occasions that I was yearning for your last column," Kissinger wrote. "Now that it has happened, I confess to a case of nostalgia only slightly tinged with exasperation. You performed a great service as a curmudgeonly sentinel on behalf of freedom, and I shall miss your integrity and commitment as a regular diet."
Not all of the inscriptions and correspondence were that diplomatic, particularly when the authors referenced others.
A letter from contrarian journalist Robert Sherrill stored inside his 1968 book "The Drugstore Liberal" commends Safire for "carving" on John F. Kennedy. "We need to cut that myth down to about the size of a walnut," Sherrill wrote. "Or a pea."
Best wishes, of course.
Tucked inside Russell Baker's 1965 book "All Things Considered" is a 1975 letter from Safire's New York Times colleague with this assessment of Kissinger: "Ego doth make him a s--t." The book - and the letter - are still available. The price: $70.
Safire's collection, which also includes dozens of centuries-old language tomes he often used in writing his popular language column, enters the used and rare book market with print works on the ascendancy after years of decline.
Many independent bookstores are thriving. Hardcover book sales are trending up. For collectors, books owned and written in by notable people have become highly coveted.
"It's no longer just an ordinary copy of the book," said Rob Rulon-Miller, a rare books dealer in Minnesota who sold Safire language books and appraised his collection. "It's Safire's copy of the book."
Though Capitol Hill Books declined to say how much it paid for Safire's books, Rulon-Miller said his appraisal, back during George H.W. Bush's presidency, was in "the tens of thousands" of dollars.
Safire's home office was, to him, a library. Books lined much of the room. They were loosely organized. In one area, books on language. In another, signed books by political and cultural figures, many with typed and handwritten letters inside.
In addition to political intrigue, Safire's collection has revealed a friendly and intellectually curious correspondence with a range of cultural elites.
Safire seemed particularly close with Nobel laureate Saul Bellow, who died in 2005. Capitol Hill Books is selling several Bellow works containing copies of letters and notes he sent Safire.
In 1995, after Safire's novel "Sleeper Spy" received an unfriendly review in the Times, Bellow tried to cheer him up.
"My naivete is so persistent that I was surprised," Bellow wrote, "by the offensive review of your novel in the daily Times. I thought your book was ingenious, diverting and even instructive."
Herman Wouk wrote with praise. So did David Mamet - about Israel.
"Please permit an American Jew to offer his appreciation of your strong support of Israel," Mamet wrote by hand. "With all respect, David Mamet."
The wonders go on.
After Safire wrote a column about the word do-rag, Colin Powell sent him an actual do-rag, which Safire stored inside Powell's book "My American Journey." It sold for $125.
Alan Dershowitz, in a book on Thomas Jefferson, scribbled, "To Bill, Who even Jefferson could learn from!"
Novelist Joyce Carol Oates inscribed a book "with much admiration for your writing, and wit; and very best wishes." Kurt Vonnegut signed "Jailbird" with this: "Most respectfully for the writer William Safire."
But with Safire, it's the political books that most intrigue.
He won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1978 for columns about a scandal during the Carter administration involving T. Bertram Lance, director of the Office of Management and Budget.
Inside a multivolume government-published book titled "Matters Relating to T. Bertram Lance: Hearings Before the Committee on Governmental Affairs, United States Senate," was a letter from - of all people - Lance.
"Dear William," it said. "The Bible says 'Love those who despise you.' May you and yours have a Merry Christmas & a Happy new year - Bert Lance."
It's still available - for $100.
So is "Shadow: Five Presidents and The Legacy of Watergate" by Bob Woodward.
"To Bill Safire," Woodward scribbled. "Watergate is still alive."

Treatment of migrant kids is US shame

Texto completo: On a subject as fraught as immigration, there's plenty of room for disagreement about border security, workplace enforcement, paths to citizenship and other policies. But when the topic is the well-being of kids crammed into federal immigration centers on the southern border, there ought to be no room for debate.
For young children, toddlers and infants guilty only of being carried or led into the United States, it's unconscionable for federal officials to banish them for days or weeks to squalor.
At the facility in Clint, Texas, according to a report by The New York Times and the El Paso Times (which is part of the USA TODAY Network), children have gone hungry and without hygiene, beds or adults to care for them. They've been buffeted by outbreaks of scabies, shingles and chickenpox.
Adult migrants, many fleeing Central American violence for asylum in the USA, are crammed for days or weeks in holding cells designed for a fraction of their number. The stench in standing-room-only conditions with temperatures in the 80s is a mix of unwashed bodies, untreated diarrhea and urine. That's according to the Department of Homeland Security's own internal watchdog.
For those watching, this is what a national disgrace looks like.
And how has President Donald Trump responded? With his characteristic deflection and denial. ("We're doing a fantastic job under the circumstances.")
Maybe so, but border officers warned superiors for months that detention conditions were crashing — to no avail. Only when the inhumanity was exposed in photographs, news accounts and rushed inspector general reports did officials suddenly begin finding alternative housing for some 2,000 confined children.
Trump declared an end to his family separation policy last year, falsely claiming it began under President Barack Obama. But strangely, inspectors still find young children held without parents. After a decade of not a single death, at least seven migrant children have died under federal care this year.
Thankfully, the number of children in custody has eased of late.
For now, there's lasting damage — to the children. Many already traumatized by the violence they fled in their home countries risk severe mental health consequences after being separated from parents and subjected to squalor in U.S. immigration centers.
Trump covets a place in history. With his administration's cruelty toward Central American migrants, he might well have earned it.

Texto completo: ______
What will be in the Smithsonian?
Bob Ross made three versions of each painting that appeared on "The Joy of Painting." The first was made before the show, to be used as a reference. He painted the second during the 26-minute taping, sometimes with last-minute improvisations. The third was made afterward, for instructional books.
The donation to the Smithsonian includes the book version of "Blue Ridge Falls," from Season 30 (1994):
As well as all three versions of the painting "On a Clear Day," from Season 14 (1988):
Other items include a converted stepladder that was used as an easel used during the first season of the show, and two handwritten notebooks that were used to plan the production of Seasons 2 and 3.
How were the objects chosen?
"The hardest part was choosing the paintings," said Eric Jentsch, the entertainment and sports curator for the National Museum of American History. Mr. Jentsch and his colleague Ryan Lintelman visited the offices of Bob Ross Inc. in Herndon, Va., to find the images and materials that best exemplified Mr. Ross's lifetime of work.
The Smithsonian also acquired fan letters sent to Mr. Ross, including some written after he died of lymphoma in 1995 at 52. "These letters help reveal the significant impact Ross has had on diverse individuals and communities, helping them to express and feel better about themselves," Mr. Jentsch said.
The paintings and other objects officially became part of the museum's permanent collection on March 22.
For now, the Smithsonian has no plans to display the paintings.
How many Bob Ross paintings are there exactly?
We don't know.
According to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight, Mr. Ross painted in 381 of the 403 episodes of the show (the rest featured a guest). If three versions were made of each of those paintings, at least 1,143 originals would exist. Bob Ross Inc. estimates that it has 1,165 paintings stored on site.
But Mr. Ross also painted as an instructor, as well as for public events and for charity, so there may be additional paintings out there.
How much does one cost?
In the rare cases when a Bob Ross painting does surface, it depends who is buying. Joan Kowalski, president of Bob Ross Inc., said she has seen authentic Ross paintings sell online for $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 in recent years.
After we set out on our quest, a three-panel painting described as a "Bob Ross Original Oil Painting Triptych Mountain Landscape" surfaced on eBay. It is listed at $ 55,000:
How do I have a painting authenticated?
Bob Ross Inc. will authenticate paintings that are sent to be inspected in person by Annette Kowalski, Joan Kowalski's mother and the woman who discovered Mr. Ross. (The company will not certify images that can be viewed only as scans or digital files.)
Annette Kowalski said that in addition to the brushwork and other signs of Mr. Ross's hand, she looks for a specific detail in the quality of his signature that she declined to describe:
If a painting is certified as an original Bob Ross, the owner will be provided with documentation attesting its authenticity.
Can I visit Bob Ross Inc.?
Bob Ross Inc. is not open to visitors. Some of the original paintings are displayed at the Bob Ross Art Workshop & Gallery in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. Starting next year, people will be able to visit the studio in Muncie, Ind., where the show was taped.
Is it true that there are no people in the paintings?
In the 11 years that Mr. Ross painted on television, there are only a few known instances when he included a human figure in his landscapes. In "Morning Walk" (Series 17, Episode 11, from 1989), two people stroll through the woods:
In "Campfire" (Series 3, Episode 10, 1984), a figure in a hat leans against a tree:
According to Annette Kowalski, "Campfire" was among Mr. Ross's least favorite paintings.
Though cabins often appear in Mr. Ross's landscapes, they are rarely depicted with chimneys (another sign of people).
How did the Kowalskis come to own the company?
Originally Mr. Ross and his wife, Jane, shared ownership of the company with Annette and Walt Kowalski, who had helped to finance Mr. Ross's early career. Jane Ross died in 1992; when Mr. Ross died in 1995, the company was left to the Kowalskis alone.
What's the name of the Kowalskis' dog?
Cricket.
What were the names of Bob Ross's squirrels?
Mr. Ross had several pet squirrels, a number of which he featured on his show. One was named Bobette -- a combination of Bob and Annette. Bobette appeared in several episodes in Series 18 (1989). Another squirrel, Peapod, appeared in Series 22 and 23 (1991). Peapod Jr. joined in Series 30 and 31 (1993-94).

What's the story with the hair?
Bob Ross did not always have a perm:
According to Annette Kowalski, Mr. Ross originally chose to perm his hair because it was cheaper than getting frequent haircuts.
Later, she said, he disliked the hairstyle but did not feel he could change it because it was depicted in the company logo:
Who was Bill Alexander?
William Alexander was the creator of "The Magic of Oil Painting," which aired on PBS from 1974 to 1982. In 1984, he symbolically handed over his brush to Mr. Ross in a marketing campaign.

They later had a falling out. In a 1991 interview with The New York Times, Mr. Alexander said, "He betrayed me." "I invented 'wet on wet,"' he added. "I trained him, and he is copying me -- what bothers me is not just that he betrayed me, but that he thinks he can do it better."
Did Bob Ross want his paintings to be shown?
In 1994, the talk show host Phil Donahue asked Mr. Ross to "say out loud your work will never hang in a museum."
"Well, maybe it will," Mr. Ross replied. "But probably not the Smithsonian."
When The Times asked Mr. Ross about his legacy in 1991, he gave a similar answer:
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Texto completo: It's that time of the year -- Prime Day is right around the corner on July 15 and 16. The event has turned into summer's version of Black Friday, a shopping frenzy that can turn into a hangover of spending regret once the packages arrive on your doorstep.
Even professionals can get trigger happy over bargains they don't need. On the very first Prime Day, two of our colleagues at Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, got sucked into a bargain-basement price on a stepping exercise machine that wound up first as a giant clothes hanger and then as trash.
Here's how Wirecutter can help you. We believe that buying the right things, not just more gear, can make life better. That's why the Wirecutter Deals team will be spending the next week scouring Amazon's Prime Day lists (as well as the sales of other retailers attempting to capitalize on Prime Day fever) to find true deals only on the things worth buying. If last year is any model, Wirecutter Deals will reject over 99 percent of the offerings and highlight only the exceptional offers we would buy with our own money.
To make the most of Prime Day, follow the Wirecutter Deals page throughout the event, where we'll be updating our list of researched deals that are actually worth your time. See Wirecutter's latest deals here.
In collaboration with everyone at Wirecutter, here are five things to avoid on Prime Day.
2019 TVs
Unless you get a truly incredible Prime Day price on a 2019 television, buying a 2018 TV on sale will get you the better value. Our TV expert Chris Heinonen says the best TV deals generally come on Black Friday and after companies debut their newest models at the annual CES trade show (the next one will be in January). If Prime Day is anything like Black Friday, you might also need to keep an eye out for confusing model numbers on versions that omit features -- send us a tweet if you want to be sure a TV is a good value.
The bundle blunder (and the gift card gaffe)
Make sure that all the pieces of a bundle are really things you need and want. You might want a smart doorbell, but do you want or need the ubiquitous bundled mini smart speaker that comes with that if it represents any additional cost? Are you prepared to take the time to sell that extra item? Similarly, if a deal comes with a gift card from a lesser-known retailer (or one with specific terms such as a 90-day expiration), will you be able to put it to good use? If not, pass on the bundle.
Wasting the day waiting for Lightning Deals
Lightning Deals are designed to encourage impulse purchases. Instead of succumbing, browse the Lightning Deals in the morning to see what will be on offer, check with Wirecutter to make sure the price is low enough to qualify as a good deal, then set an alarm for a few minutes before it starts so that you don't miss out.
Big-ticket buys you don't need
Just because an item like a treadmill or a laptop is deeply discounted from its usual steep price doesn't mean you should get it. Make a list of the specific things you need and want (even down to the make and model) and stick to it. Get independent confirmation from a reliable source (like Wirecutter) that it's a good price on a quality item. If Wirecutter's previous Prime Day best sellers are an indicator, you'll most likely see a lot of small electronics (headphones, Bluetooth trackers) and small appliances (Instant Pots, robot vacuums) fly by. They're valuable only if you know you'll use them.
Redundant or obsolete tech
Do you really need that thing? If you own a toaster oven with convection, you already have something better than an air fryer with a big footprint (Wirecutter doesn't recommend any air fryers). Also, sometimes older items on Prime Day are discounted for a reason -- they're aging out. Check for recent, newer-generation releases to make sure your shiny new thing doesn't feel out of date next month.

Tip of the Week
This week I've invited the writer Stephanie Dubick to talk about mothers.
Our relationships with our mothers are complex. While some of us might think of our mom as our protector and nurturer, for others, the relationship is far more complicated.
If you have a difficult relationship with your mom, sometimes the simple act of speaking or writing about your experience is enough to help you heal and move forward.
So suggests Michele Filgate, a writer and editor who, in her new anthology, "What My Mother and I Don't Talk About," explores the intricacies and sometimes difficulties in the mother-child relationship. By putting fear aside, opening up to your mom about your life can make you feel less alone and more connected to her. A simple, practical way to get there is something you already use every day: email. Not only can it give you the time and space to write messages on your terms, it also allows you to comfortably express, and work through, tough conversations.
"There's a relief in breaking the silence," Ms. Filgate writes. "This is also how we grow." By acknowledging the things we don't talk about, we not only heal from strained relationships with our moms, but we also heal our relationship with ourselves.
"The more we face what we can't or won't or don't know," Ms. Filgate writes, "the more we understand one another."
If you feel as if you have unresolved issues with your mother, try it out for yourself this week: Write down the things you don't talk about with her, the secrets that often go unspoken. It might feel good to speak -- or write -- your truth.

It’s time to check NASA’s astronomical spending

Texto completo: For a government website, NASA’s homepage is an exciting place. Americans can read news releases brimming with all sorts of interesting announcements. For example, on June 3, Pennsylvania students had “an opportunity to speak live with a NASA astronaut aboard the International Space Station.” The agency also lets taxpayers know that NASA is pro-small business, and willing to hand out dollars to startups to develop solar panels. But NASA is less than forthcoming about its mounting cost overruns and schedule delays — which are costing taxpayers billions of dollars and jeopardizing future missions. Taxpayers deserve better.
You wouldn’t know it unless you checked it out for yourself, but NASA has a serious spending problem. According to a report released in May by the Government Accountability Office, NASA’s major projects have veered nearly thirty percent over budget, as average launches are typically delayed by over a year. One of the chief culprits behind exploding cost figures is the James Webb Space Telescope, which was originally supposed to cost upward of $3.5 billion and launch by 2011. The latest estimates (but probably not the last) have the telescope launching in 2021 and costing $9.7 billion — a 177 percent increase.
In a 2018 report, NASA’s inspector general pointed out that NASA has a persistent, reckless culture of misplaced optimism, which prevents it from soberly assessing costs on the novel technologies it dreams up. After proposing the project, NASA had to invent 10 technologies in order to even make the JWST viable. In popular discourse, a proposal that precedes available technology is called a “pipe dream” — these are fun to have, but shouldn’t be dependent on the taxpayer’s dollar.
The JWST is not a one-off. The Hubble Space Telescope itself followed a similar fiscal path. NASA’s go-to star searcher was supposed to cost $200 million when it was proposed, but, by the end, costs ballooned to more than $1 billion. In 2008, former NASA science chief Alan Stern warned in a New York Times op-ed that “A CANCER is overtaking our space agency: the routine acquiescence to immense cost increases in projects.”
At the very least, taxpayers can take solace in the fact that these expenditures aren’t that big compared to the rest of federal budget. But, still — NASA’s 2019 budget of $21.5 billion is one of the highest since the Apollo Program (after adjusting for inflation). And its spending is even about to surge “bigly.” The Trump administration is determined to bring the U.S. back to the moon, and, right now, NASA doesn’t have enough funding for that. Depending on the report cited, another voyage to the moon could cost taxpayers anywhere from $53 billion to $86 billion (after adjusting for inflation from initial reports). Again, the mission is delayed — the Space Launch System tasked with bringing humans to the moon is roughly three years behind schedule. Too, it’ll cost double the originally-projected amount. The next trip to the moon seems to be more of a silly competition with China or Russia rather than a quest for scientific knowledge.
Robotic probes exploring new worlds would be a much better idea. Besides, robotic exploration can be done at a fraction of the cost, and without the risk of radiation to astronauts devoid of Earth’s atmospheric protections. Regardless of the future missions that NASA chooses to undertake, the agency should work with lawmakers, watchdogs and independent auditors to ensure that initial budget estimates are not too rosy. For taxpayers’ sake, America’s space agency should stop shooting for the moon and try getting its spending under control.

Texto completo: President Trump accused Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of making up the claim that migrants in detention centers were drinking from toilets while speaking to reporters Friday morning.
"I mean, to have Ocasio[-Cortez] say they are drinking out of toilets. She made that up, okay? That’s a phony story. She made it up. I tell you what. I have been with ICE, and I've been with border control a lot," Trump said. "They love those people coming across the border. They love them, and I’ve seen it. They love them."Trump: Ocasio-Cortez is making up claim that migrants are 'drinking out of toilets'Trump's accusation comes over a week after Ocasio-Cortez's claim, which she made the day she and other members of Congress visited detention centers.
“Just left the 1st CBP facility. I see why CBP officers were being so physically & sexually threatening towards me. Officers were keeping women in cells w/ no water & had told them to drink out of the toilets,” the New York Democratic congresswoman tweeted, referring to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.TweetTrump also insulted the media's reporting on the situation at the border.
"I read a phony story in the New York Times today or the other day about the detention centers, about the conditions," the president added. "I have people calling me up at the highest level from Border Patrol and ICE, almost crying about that phony story, and they never saw anything. They have phony sources. They don’t even have sources. They write whatever they want."Story URLPhoto Caption:Pictured are Donald Trump, left, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, right.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SHANGRI-LA 9 p.m. on Showtime. The fabled Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu, Calif., was once a hangout for the Band and Bob Dylan. Now, it's an oasis overseen by the megaproducer Rick Rubin -- and a reflection of Rubin's minimalist sensibilities. So it makes sense as a setting for this four-part documentary from the director Morgan Neville ("Won't You Be My Neighbor?"), which takes a meandering dive into Rubin's life and work as a producer. The fact that Rubin has worked across so many genres (his best-known collaborations include producing for acts like the Beastie Boys and Johnny Cash) means that this dive should have something for everyone. But as the title suggests, the star may be the studio itself. "There's an extra, added feeling of coming to a place where a lot of good music has been made," Rubin says in the first episode. "I don't know if it's the energy collected in the space, or if it's just people's belief," he adds. "It doesn't really matter."
THE TAKING OF PELHAM 123 (2009) 10:05 p.m. on AMC. New Yorkers might have good reason not to hold savory views of their commutes, but at least they don't have John Travolta commandeering their subway cars. That's what happens in this thriller from Tony Scott, which updates a classic 1974 New York film through cleaner trains and better action-movie technology. Travolta plays Ryder, the tattooed leader of a crew of hijackers who take over a 6 train. Denzel Washington plays Walter Garber, a subway dispatcher who gets roped into the incident. Washington and Travolta "conduct a tag-team master class in old-style movie star technique, barreling through every cliché and nugget of corn the script has to offer with verve and conviction," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "Even when you don't really believe them, they're always a lot of fun to watch."
AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) at 6 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. on BBC America. To see Washington in another part of New York City and on a different end of the moral spectrum than his character in "The Taking of Pelham 123," see this crime drama from Ridley Scott, in which Washington plays the 1970s drug kingpin Frank Lucas. The role of Lucas, who died in May, is one that Washington steps into easily, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, "whether flashing his wolfish grin or draining the affect from Lucas's face to show the soulless operator beneath the swagger and suit." Russell Crowe plays Richie Roberts, the New Jersey detective who brings Lucas down.
What's Streaming
POSTHUMOUS (2014) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The filmmaker Lulu Wang is in theaters this weekend with "The Farewell," starring Awkwafina. Wang's feature debut, "Posthumous," takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the art world through the story of an artist (Jack Huston) who gets famous after people think he's dead. He isn't, which creates potentially lucrative opportunities for him.

Texto completo: Several African American and Latino Democrats rallied around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez accused her of targeting "newly elected women of color" through public remarks dismissing their political influence inside the House.
The suggestion from the outspoken liberal freshman, made in a Washington Post article published Wednesday, stunned those Democrats, and it compounded their lingering anger after Ocasio-Cortez's top aide publicly accused some colleagues last month of racist actions for supporting a compromise border spending bill.
"What a weak argument, because you can't get your way? And because you are getting pushback, you resort to use the race card? Unbelievable to me," Rep. William Lacy Clay (D-Mo.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said of Ocasio-Cortez's remark.
Pelosi refused to respond directly to Ocasio-Cortez's accusation at a Thursday news conference but said she had to speak out to defend her moderate members after the aide's tweet.
Saikat Chakrabarti, Ocasio-Cortez's chief of staff, referred to members of moderate Democratic groups in a tweet last month as "New Southern Democrats" who are "hell bent to do to black and brown people today what the old Southern Democrats did in the 40s."
The aide deleted the tweet but posted others saying the moderates' actions "still enable a racist system."
"Our members took offense at that," Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters. "I addressed that. How they're interpreting and carrying it to another place is up to them, but I'm not going to be discussing it any further."
The tweet and Ocasio-Cortez's latest remark have inserted an explosive racial dimension into the feud between Pelosi and "the Squad" - freshman Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) - one that burst into a full boil this week when Pelosi told the New York Times that the four "didn't have any following," citing their lonely votes last month against a Democratic-crafted bill to address the southern border crisis.
Ocasio-Cortez responded in the Post interview, calling Pelosi's comments "just outright disrespectful . . . the explicit singling out of newly elected women of color." Ocasio-Cortez is of Puerto Rican descent, Pressley is African American, Omar is a Somali immigrant and Tlaib is Palestinian American.
Other veteran Democrats said Ocasio-Cortez's comment struck a discordant note.
"It is a provocative statement," said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II (D-Mo.), a member of the Congressional Black Caucus. "The speaker has a lot of allies inside the caucus who are people of color. A lot - you know, like 99 percent."
Clay rebuked Chakrabarti - a former leader of the Justice Democrats, a left-wing activist group that has supported primary challenges to Clay and other veteran minority Democrats: "It shows you how ignorant and little history he knows, how ignorant he is to American history. How dare he."
In a CNN interview Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez said she was "really just pointing out a pattern."
"We're not talking just about progressives - it's singling out four individuals, and, knowing the media environment that we're operating in, knowing the amount of death threats that we get, knowing the amount of concentration of attention, I think it's just worth asking why."
Asked whether she thinks Pelosi harbors racial animus, she said: "No, no, absolutely not, absolutely not."
The "Squad" won backing Thursday from some liberal allies. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said she and co-chairman Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have requested a meeting with Pelosi.
"I generally have seen Speaker Pelosi be very, very respectful of her members," Jayapal said. But, she added, "The comments she made, however she meant them, have a certain interpretation, obviously, and I think it's just important that we clear this."
But several other minority lawmakers said it wasn't Pelosi who was in the wrong. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (D-N.Y.), a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, called Pelosi a "proven leader with a lot of experience and maturity."
Leaving a private member meeting Thursday morning, Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) said members were buzzing about both Chakrabarti's tweet and Ocasio-Cortez's remark.
The tweet was "insulting" and "a big issue," Meeks added. "To try to compare this to what African Americans went through? . . . I think the African American community deserves an apology for that."
Some Democrats, however, are looking for more than an apology from Ocasio-Cortez and Chakrabarti.
"They want him out," said a senior Democratic aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal conversations.
Pelosi told reporters Thursday she was "not going to discipline a member's staff. That's up to the member to do." She added that she was unaware of his tweet "until members came to me, some almost crying, some very upset and angry about the language" used to describe members of the centrist Blue Dogs and New Democrats, prompting her to speak out at Wednesday's caucus meeting.
Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez, declined to comment on the criticism of Chakrabarti.
At a Wednesday meeting in Pelosi's office, Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, told Pelosi in stark terms that moderates were irate about Chakrabarti's tweet - specifically citing Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.), one of several moderate African Americans representing a Southern district.
Sewell has tried multiple times to discuss the matter with Ocasio-Cortez, Kilmer said in the meeting, but has not gotten her calls returned. Two people present described the exchange on the condition of anonymity because of the private nature of the meeting.
Sewell said Thursday the tweet was "offensive" and issued a statement noting that she was subject to bigotry while growing up.
"So, to even insinuate that I, or any other member of the New Dems, would promote policies that are racist and hateful or ones that would negatively impact communities of color is deeply offensive and couldn't be further from the truth," she said in the statement.

Texto completo: A recent report from the U.S. Office of the Inspector General painted a grim picture of the situation at the border: Customs and Border Protection holding children for longer than 72 hours, adults held in rooms with only standing room for a week, and overcrowded facilities.
Under the President’s “Zero Tolerance Policy,” all adults apprehended crossing the border are prosecuted, with no exceptions for asylum seekers or those with children. Prior administrations had prosecuted migrants sparingly and the system is now overloaded.
Late last month, the U.S. House of Representatives sought to take action to improve conditions at the border. But while the Democrats that control that body all agree something needs to be done on the border, the fight over a border bill laid bare a conflict between moderates and progressives ⁠— the Problem Solvers Caucus and both the Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus.
At the center of the conflict is the question of what’s most needed at the border right now: more funding or more oversight?
Not another dollar
It took time for House Democrats to agree to a stop-gap emergency bill to provide humanitarian assistance at the southern border.
The first bill to make it to the floor came out of negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It provided additional funding to CBP, but specified exactly how money could be used by Trump administration agencies at processing facilities. That satisfied some members’ desires that agencies not be given a “blank check.” It also provided support for non-profit organizations housing asylum seekers, additional safeguards for children, and a reduction in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which houses migrants after they have been processed by CBP).
That bill didn’t satisfy Progressive Caucus Whip Rep. Ilhan Omar, of Minnesota’s Fifth District.
“We cannot continue to throw money at a dysfunctional system,” Omar said as she left a tense meeting in Pelosi’s office on June 26.
She voted against the bill, along with three other Democrats: Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, saying they would not vote in favor of providing another dollar of funding for Customs and Border Protection or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (which would have received an additional $1.2 billion and $128 million, respectively).
The bill, opposed by most Republicans, passed the House 320–195.
The Senate, however, rejected the bill on a 37-55 vote. Instead, it passed its own border bill.
The Senate bill was different. It did not have support for non-governmental organizations housing asylum seekers and it did not have many of the funding restrictions that were in the House bill. The Senate bill also included an additional $50 million in funding to speed up processing of asylum claims.
That bill passed 84-8.
Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith voted for the House bill when it was considered by the Senate, and when it failed, the Senate bill. (Sen. Amy Klobuchar was not present for the votes, which were held on the same day as the first Democratic presidential debate). Smith explained that her vote for the latter by saying it provided help that was too critical to pass up: funding for supplies, in addition to medical care and alternatives to detention. “These are all really important provisions,” Smith said. “And I think this was the best that we could get out of a Republican controlled Senate and what the president would sign.”
But before the president would get a chance to sign the Senate bill, it had to go back to the House.
An expedient solution
The House Problem Solvers Caucus, which includes Third District Rep. Dean Phillips, pushed to pass the Senate bill immediately — without modifications that would require further negotiation between the House and Senate.
For Phillips, there was no disagreement over whether children are being mistreated. He just believed that agencies needed more funding immediately, and that the Senate bill was the most feasible option. Philips voted for the initial House bill, but as his office put it: “With Mitch McConnell running the Senate, [passing the Senate bill] was a case of getting something or getting nothing.”
Brendan Welch, Phillips’ Communications Director, said that Phillips will be leading a bipartisan group of House members later this month to see what’s happening at the border with their own eyes.
“Dean is committed to working with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find bipartisan solutions to the humanitarian crisis at our border,” Welch said. “With a Republican Senate and a Republican in the White House, right now the only way to make meaningful progress for migrant children and families is on a bipartisan basis.”
The Senate version of the bill passed the House. But this time, the opposition wasn’t just four members — it was a large portion of the Progressive Caucus and Hispanic Caucus, as well as St. Paul Rep. Betty McCollum.
In an email to constituents, McCollum said that she “could not in good conscience vote to provide the Trump administration with additional funding without strict and enforceable conditions to protect the well-being of these vulnerable children.”
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus called the final bill “a betrayal of our American values.” The New York Times headline read: “House Passes Senate Border Bill In Striking Defeat For Pelosi.”
“In order to get resources to the children fastest, we will reluctantly pass the Senate bill,” Pelosi wrote to her colleagues. “As we pass the Senate bill, we will do so with a Battle Cry as to how we go forward to protect children in a way that truly honors their dignity and worth.”
Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, who serves with Omar on the leadership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called out Phillips’ in a post on Twitter: “Since when did the Problem Solvers Caucus become the Child Abuse Caucus? Wouldn’t they want to at least fight against contractors who run deplorable facilities? Kids are the only ones who could lose today,” Pocan wrote.
On the floor of the House, Phillips and fellow Problem Solvers member Max Rose (D-NY) asked him to apologize.
He did not.
A big giveaway?
It wasn’t just progressives in Congress who were critical of the decision to pass the Senate bill; immigrant-rights advocates in Minnesota also took notice.
In the days before Independence Day, advocates took to the streets of Minneapolis, and later to Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s office, protesting the treatment of asylum seekers at the border.
Common Cause Minnesota replied to a post by Phillips on Twitter in which he explained his advocacy for the Senate bill, asking, “Were any Latino or immigrant led group/org working with children and families at the boarder [sic] asked for what they wanted? Were the broader policy implication explained to those providing frontline care? When is power held accountable? How does that policy honor all who’ve died?”
Cassanda Berg, of the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, characterized the Senate bill as a “big giveaway” with “limited strings attached.” She noted that MIRAC was more aligned with Omar and McCollum’s position.
Berg has direct experience with conditions on the border. In April, she traveled with 11 other MIRAC activists to Tucson, Arizona and Nogales, Mexico. Berg said they volunteered at The Inn in Tucson, a temporary housing shelter for asylum seekers established by the local United Methodist churches.
“The first thing they do when people come in is they’re welcomed. Then they can call their family. Then they get a hot meal, a shower, and we take them upstairs to get donated clothes,” she said, adding, “So if a church with no assistance from the government can handle that, it’s honestly unconscionable — the treatment of migrants in these detention facilities.”
On Monday, Pelosi announced that the House plans to vote on new legislation to address the treatment of migrants in the coming weeks. But any potential leverage for including new safeguards may be gone, since Republicans already secured funding for CBP and ICE via the Senate bill.
The situation as a whole has many immigrants right advocates, including Berg, upset with the entire process and the compromises made by Democratic legislators.
“I’m not sure what the repercussions would be,” Berg said, in reference to those who pushed the Senate version of the bill along. “I would say that we need to continue to put pressure on these representatives to take an actual moral stance against agencies that are out of control and can’t be trusted.”

In Our View Trump threat to, not steward of, environment

Texto completo: President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself a champion of the environment, a statement either laughable, head-scratching, or as one former Environmental Protection Agency official put it, “truly Orwellian.”
Let's face it: If Trump is a champion of the environment, then the Kardashians are shy, modest wallflowers.
Perhaps most puzzling about Trump's Monday announcement is not only did he campaign for office as an outspoken opponent of environmental regulations in general and the EPA specifically, his administration has taken a number of steps in the past three years to undo or roll back a number of those protections. According to The New York Times, more than 80 environmental rules and regulations are on their way out under Trump.
Anna M. Phillips of the Los Angeles Times this week outlined several of the inconsistencies between Trump's statement on Monday and the reality of what's been happening since he took office. For example, Trump said, “From day one, my administration has made it a top priority to ensure that America has among the very cleanest air and cleanest water on the planet.” However, Phillips reported, “EPA data show that there were more days of polluted air during each of Trump's first two years in office than during any of the four years before.”
As for water, Phillips noted that under Trump, the EPA has been criticized for not doing enough to make drinking water safer. Environmentalists and some members of Congress have accused the EPA of stalling development of safety limits for a class of chemicals known as PFAS, which have been found in both public water systems and private wells. PFAS have been linked to cancer and other health problems.
Let us not forget that Trump is working to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, has been an unabashed cheerleader for the coal industry, despite the market forces working against it, and has nominated a former energy industry lobbyist to run the EPA.
Then there's the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, about 200 miles upstream from Clark County. The administration recently opted to reclassify some of the radioactive waste stored at Hanford from “high-level” waste to “low-level.” As we noted editorially, the action “amounts to nothing less than a dereliction of duty.” Reclassifying the waste doesn't make it any less dangerous, just easier and less expensive for the federal government to dispose of at low-level facilities.
The Trump administration has also proposed cutting the budget for Hanford's cleanup by $416 million, even as the cost of that project continues to climb. This flies in the face of the U.S. government's moral and legal obligation to clean up Hanford, which was a critical component of the Manhattan Project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II.
As the 2020 presidential race heats up, it's certain we'll be hearing plenty of hyperbole from both political parties' candidates. But let's hope they do a better job of clinging to a whiff of credibility than Trump's assertion he's an environmentalist.

Texto completo: Las comunidades inmigrantes del sur de California están nuevamente en vilo por las amenazas que se revivieron hoy sobre los posibles operativos que tienenn en la mira a más de 2,000 personas que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación , según el artículo publicado por el New York Times.
El diario además indicó, citando a dos funcionarios y a un extrabajador del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, en inglés), que pidieron el anonimato, que las redadas estarán a cargo de personal del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE).
Ante el temor generado por dichas declaraciones, el gobernador de California, Gavin Newsom , envió un mensaje en el cual rechazó nuevamente las redadas que infunden temor y ansiedad en la población del Estado Dorado.
Newsom se sumó a las críticas de otros alcalde y gobernadores y reconoció que los rumores están aumentando la “ansiedad” en la comunidad migrante y urgió a prepararse para cualquier contingencia con ICE, pues es “vital” saber que los indocumentados también tienen derechos.
“Sólo quiero decir a las personas que están ansiosas por los que pueden tocar a su puerta: cuando hablamos de que conozcas tus derechos, no abras la puerta. Sin una orden de registro, no tienes que abrir la puerta”, dijo el mandatario.
Rumors of mass ICE raids in major cities this weekend is stirring up anxiety within our immigrant communities.
My message to each of you: Regardless of your immigration status, be prepared. It’s critical that you know your rights.https://t.co/c2PNxfks2B pic.twitter.com/vvObO56I5B
— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) July 11, 2019
California, el estado con mayor número de indocumentados, cuenta con dos ciudades que grandes ciudades que podrían estar en el blanco de las próximas redadas de ICE: Los Ángeles y San Francisco. Otras urbes donde podrían ocurrir esas redadas son Chicago (Illinois), Baltimore (Maryland), Nueva York (Nueva York), Houston (Texas), y Miami (Florida).
Un día después de que las autoridades estadounidenses confirmarán un leve descenso en la detención de inmigrantes en la frontera, del que se puede inferir un retroceso en el paso de indocumentados, medios de comunicación locales informaron del comienzo a partir del domingo de las temidas operaciones en al menos diez de la principales ciudades del país.
A mediados de junio, el presidente, Donald Trump , había anunciado por Twitter que ICE iniciaría un proceso para deportar a “millones” de indocumentados, decisión que dejó en suspenso escasas horas de la fecha anticipada por medios locales para el comienzo de esas operaciones.

Texto completo: Las comunidades inmigrantes del sur de California están nuevamente en vilo por las amenazas que se revivieron hoy sobre los posibles operativos que tienenn en la mira a más de 2,000 personas que ya han recibido órdenes de deportación , según el artículo publicado por el New York Times.
El diario además indicó, citando a dos funcionarios y a un extrabajador del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional (DHS, en inglés), que pidieron el anonimato, que las redadas estarán a cargo de personal del Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas (ICE).
Ante el temor generado por dichas declaraciones, el gobernador de California, Gavin Newsom , envió un mensaje en el cual rechazó nuevamente las redadas que infunden temor y ansiedad en la población del Estado Dorado.
Newsom se sumó a las críticas de otros alcalde y gobernadores y reconoció que los rumores están aumentando la “ansiedad” en la comunidad migrante y urgió a prepararse para cualquier contingencia con ICE, pues es “vital” saber que los indocumentados también tienen derechos.
“Sólo quiero decir a las personas que están ansiosas por los que pueden tocar a su puerta: cuando hablamos de que conozcas tus derechos, no abras la puerta. Sin una orden de registro, no tienes que abrir la puerta”, dijo el mandatario.
Rumors of mass ICE raids in major cities this weekend is stirring up anxiety within our immigrant communities.
My message to each of you: Regardless of your immigration status, be prepared. It’s critical that you know your rights.https://t.co/c2PNxfks2B pic.twitter.com/vvObO56I5B
— Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) July 11, 2019
California, el estado con mayor número de indocumentados, cuenta con dos ciudades que grandes ciudades que podrían estar en el blanco de las próximas redadas de ICE: Los Ángeles y San Francisco. Otras urbes donde podrían ocurrir esas redadas son Chicago (Illinois), Baltimore (Maryland), Nueva York (Nueva York), Houston (Texas), y Miami (Florida).
Un día después de que las autoridades estadounidenses confirmarán un leve descenso en la detención de inmigrantes en la frontera, del que se puede inferir un retroceso en el paso de indocumentados, medios de comunicación locales informaron del comienzo a partir del domingo de las temidas operaciones en al menos diez de la principales ciudades del país.
A mediados de junio, el presidente, Donald Trump , había anunciado por Twitter que ICE iniciaría un proceso para deportar a “millones” de indocumentados, decisión que dejó en suspenso escasas horas de la fecha anticipada por medios locales para el comienzo de esas operaciones.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner John Sanders told CNN that "a lot more needs to be done" for migrant children on the southern U. S. border.
Sanders explained why he left the Trump administration in an interview with CNN published on Thursday. Sanders announced his resignation after two and a half months in office on June 25 amid reports children were being held in a Clint, Texas, Border Patrol station in overcrowded conditions.
"They made a choice, and so I thought it was a good time to go," Sanders said, in reference to his replacement by Mark Morgan, who had previously been serving as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
Sanders told CNN he was sympathetic to the plight of migrant children in federal detention, especially after several children died in Border Patrol custody.
"It hit me hard, that he was in the cell sleeping," Sanders said, referring to pictures and videos of Carlos Gregorio Hernandez Vasquez, a 16-year-old Guatemalan boy who died after being diagnosed with the flu in a Border Patrol station.

"Helping the kids. That has forever changed me. And I think a lot more needs to be done for them," he said to CNN.
On July 2, the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General issued a report showing that migrant children detained by Border Patrol in the Rio Grande Valley were held in abject conditions.
"That's what conditions were like," said Sanders in reference to the reports. "They were very, very bad. "
"Why ever people come, they are here. I think that compassion and empathy is important to ensure they are treated humanely with dignity with respect," Sanders told CNN.
According to CNN, Sanders did not directly criticize the Trump administration, but he had come into the job seeking to "do good" for migrants.
"I didn't see any of it is political," Sanders explained. "I saw it as an opportunity to try to do good. "
Sanders had originally come to the CBP job after serving in the private sector and as an official for the Transportation Security Administration during the Obama administration.
Sanders had implored Congress to pass emergency funding for humanitarian relief on the southern border. Congress passed a $4. 6-billion package on June 26, the day after Sanders announced his resignation.
Sanders' agency had faced criticism for its treatment of migrants in Border Patrol custody after migrants and immigrant advocates alleged mistreatment and overcrowding in detention centers.
The Trump administration, though, intends to continue its hardline stance on immigration. On Sunday, according to the New York Times, the Trump administration plans to begin arrests of more than 2,000 undocumented family members across the United States. On July 5, Trump had promised the raids would begin, telling reporters, “They’ll be starting fairly soon, but I don’t call them raids, we’re removing people, all of these people who have come in over the years illegally,"

Facebook Navigating Growing Headwinds Over Cryptocurrency

Texto completo: Facebook is facing a growing chorus of doubts about its new Libra cryptocurrency project from authorities around the world, ahead of two congressional hearings on the initiative next week.
On Wednesday, the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, said Libra raised a host of "serious concerns" around "money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability."
"I just think it cannot go forward without there being broad satisfaction with the way the company has addressed money laundering" and other issues, Mr. Powell said as he testified before the House Financial Services Committee.
Mr. Powell is the latest central banker to express skepticism about Libra, which Facebook announced last month. Central bankers from Britain, France, the European Central Bank, Singapore and China have all voiced concerns. Separately, just over a week ago, five top Democrats on the Financial Services Committee wrote a letter to the social network calling on it to "immediately cease implementation plans" for Libra until lawmaker questions were answered.
The scrutiny is set to intensify when the Senate Banking Committee holds a hearing on Libra on Tuesday. The House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to hold a separate hearing about the project a day later.
The top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, sent a letter on Wednesday to Mr. Powell and others at the Fed, asking the central bank to protect consumers and the economy from "Facebook's Monopoly Money."
"We cannot allow giant companies to assert their power over critical public infrastructure," the letter said.
The blowback to Libra is the latest challenge for Facebook, which has been under fire for not guarding its users' data privacy and for spreading disinformation and misinformation globally. Those issues have hurt the Silicon Valley company's once stellar reputation and raised questions about whether it can properly exercise its power. Since then, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, has called for Facebook and other tech companies to be broken up and the Federal Trade Commission has agreed to handle potential antitrust investigations into the social network.
A Facebook spokeswoman pointed to a letter that David Marcus, who is overseeing the project, sent this week to members of Congress who had criticized Libra. In the letter, Mr. Marcus wrote that "policymakers and others are raising important questions."
"We want, and need, governments, central banks, regulators, nonprofits and other stakeholders at the table and value all of the feedback we have received," the letter said.
When Facebook unveiled Libra, company executives said they hoped it would become a new global currency and the foundation for an alternative financial system. The goal would be that Libra would enable digital payments, with companies such as Uber and Spotify taking the cryptocurrency as payment for car rides and online subscriptions.
Facebook announced Libra with 27 partners, including Mastercard and Uber, and said it hoped to have 100 by next year. Each enterprise partner is expected to invest at least $ 10 million in the initiative.
Unlike Bitcoin, Libra will have a stable value, backed by a basket of international currencies, such as the dollar, euro and yen. Before Libra is introduced, a Swiss association that is governing it will have to agree on the final design of the cryptocurrency and find banks willing to hold the money to back up the currency. Financial regulators, many of whom have been hesitant about cryptocurrencies, will need to sign off on the design.
"There is no better time for us to do this," Mr. Marcus said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Mr. Marcus has said Facebook is not controlling Libra, because Libra will be supervised by the Swiss association made up of the social network and all its partners on the project. Yet the partners themselves have shown some hesitancy about Libra, and Facebook has faced the blowback over Libra on its own.

Harvard suspends famed professor Roland Fryer for 2 years over 'unwelcome sexual conduct'

Texto completo: BOSTON — Roland Fryer Jr. , a celebrated Harvard University economics professor, will be suspended two years and see the research lab he oversees shut down permanently in response to multiple allegations of sexual harassment.
Harvard on Wednesday announced the unpaid administrative leave and a series of other sanctions – including the closing of the Education Innovation Laboratory or EdLabs, the site of many of the harassment allegations.
A review of formal allegations concluded that Fryer engaged in "unwelcome sexual conduct toward several individuals, resulting in the creation of a hostile work environment over the course of several years," wrote Claudine Gay, dean of the university's Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS), to the economics department.
"In short, Professor Fryer exhibited a pattern of behavior that failed to meet expectations of conduct within our community and was harmful to the well-being of its members," Gay said. "I was particularly upset to learn of the ways in which EdLabs members have been impacted, both personally and professionally. The totality of these behaviors is a clear violation of institutional norms and a betrayal of the trust of the FAS community. "
More: Former Harvard dean, removed after defending Weinstein, speaks out for first time since ouster, condemns school
The announcement comes more than a year after the first of multiple Title IX investigations into Fryer's behavior was launched by Harvard's Office for Dispute Resolution after one of his former employees at EdLabs, which he founded, named him in a complaint. Some of the allegations from women go back a decade.
During Fryer's two-year suspension he won't be permitted to teach, advise or conduct research involving Harvard resources.
If he returns, Gay said he will face restrictions: He won't have advising or supervisory roles at Harvard; He will be allowed to teach undergraduate courses, but subject to monitoring by a Title IX-trained individual and and without access to graduate teaching fellows; He will be able to teach graduate classes but not graduate workshops.
"At the end of those two years, I will decide whether to restore some or all of these privileges," she said.
Fryer, 42, did not respond to an email seeking comment on Harvard's decision.
However, in a 2018 letter to the editor to the New York Times, Fryer apologized for making "off-color jokes" around lab employees and commented on their dating lives.
"If anyone who worked at the lab ever felt alienated, confused or offended by the environment, I sincerely apologize," he wrote. But he rejected any allegation that he is "against women" or retaliated against employees.
The letter was in response to a Times report on a university investigation that concluded Fryer committed unwelcome conduct on seven occasions that violated university policy. The Times cited interviews of Fryer's former employees, who characterized him as "a bully," and the lab as a place where "sexual jokes and comments were routine, and where employees were expected to laugh along with the group or risk being isolated. "
Fryer sent unwanted after-hour texts, one woman alleged in a complaint, that "quickly veered into flirtatious and sexual overtures," The Times reported. The woman started visiting his apartment after starting at EdLabs at age 23. One time Fryer complained that she left too early, according to The Times. One text he sent to her read, "“Ur lucky ur not here. I would either tackle, bite u or both.
The Harvard Crimson, the university's student-run newspaper, was the first to report on the sexual harassment allegations against Fryer last year.
One of the complaints alleged Fryer committed “egregious” acts of verbal sexual harassment, the newspaper reported. The woman accused Fryer of speaking about sex in the workplace, making “sexually inappropriate comments” to and about employees and others. She also said he “objectified and sexualized” women, including female staffers.
The lab's stated mission was conducting economics research "devoted to closing the racial achievement gap. "
Fryer is considered one of the leading African-American economists in a field where minorities have historically lagged in representation. He's received the MacArthur "Genius" Fellowship and the John Bates Clark Medal, given by the American Economic Association to the best American economist under age 40, which is considered the second-highest honor in the field behind the Nobel price.
His ascendance from a humble upbringing – "From the hood to Harvard," The Economist wrote in 2015 – has been the subject of many stories.
At 30 years old, Fryer was the youngest African-American to receive tenure at Harvard. The New York Times reported Fryer is also among the highest-paid employees at Harvard, earning a salary of more than $600,000 in 2016, according to tax filings.
"Before coming to Harvard, Fryer worked at McDonald's (drive-thru, not corporate)," says Fryer's profile page on Harvard's website.
Fryer is known for his work on education, inequality, and race, his profile page reads.
Among his most controversial papers: a study that concluded there's no racial bias in shootings by police.

Harvard's actions against Fryer come after the university in May barred prominent former government professor Jorge Dominguez from its campus and stripped him of his emeritus status after an investigation found repeated "unwelcome sexual conduct" targeting multiple students and faculty over four decades.

Texto completo: Federal agents who searched the East Side Manhattan mansion of wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein turned up a "vast trove of lewd photographs" of young-looking girls, including hundreds of meticulously labeled nude pictures locked in a safe, according to federal court documents.
The description, laid out in a memo by prosecutors from the Southern District of New York, was aimed at convincing a federal judge that Epstein, who was arrested July 6 upon return from Paris on his private jet, should not be freed pending trial on charges of sex trafficking.
Agents used crowbars to force open the front door of the seven-story Upper East Side mansion.
The memo said the search turned up not only evidence supporting its sex trafficking allegations against Esptein but also "hundreds – and perhaps thousands – of sexually suggestive photographs of fully – or partially – nude females. " While investigators were still reviewing the material, the memo said one of the girls, according to her attorney, "was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken. "
It noted that other photographs were found in a locked safe that included CDs with handwritten labels including the descriptions "“Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude. ”
In calling for Epstein to remain in jail, the memo noted that he is a registered sex offender after a 2008 conviction in Florida and "is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant, rather he is a continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting deeply serious charges. "
Epstein, 66, has pleaded not guilty to one federal count of sex trafficking and one count of sex trafficking conspiracy for allegedly sexually exploiting minor girls at his homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Florida, and other locations, according to the federal indictment.
In a report on the mansion, valued at more than $55 million, The New York Times noted that its artwork includes, on the second floor, a commissioned mural of a “photorealistic prison scene that included barbed wire, corrections officers and a guard station, with Mr. Epstein portrayed in the middle. ”
The Times quotes R. Couri Hay, a public relations specialist who recently met with Epstein at his home, as saying, “(Epstein) said, ‘That’s me, and I had this painted because there is always the possibility that could be me again. ’”
The home also includes such oddities as a hallway covered with artificial eyeballs originally made for wounded soldiers, a life-size female doll hanging from a chandelier, and a chess board with custom figures, many dressed suggestively and modeled after one of Epstein's staffers, The Times reported.
Federal prosecutors said in the indictment that they were moving to seize the mansion as part of the proceedings against Epstein.

Texto completo: What's on TV
SNOWFALL 10 p.m. on FX. Franklin Saint (Damson Idris), the kingpin-in-training at the center of this 1980s Los Angeles drug tale, returns for a third season under solemn circumstances: one of his creators, the director John Singleton, died in April. Still, Saint's story rolls on. Season three begins in the summer of 1984, with money pouring in as a result of surging crack cocaine use in the city. As Saint becomes steadily more established as a player in the drug trade, he also draws increasingly more attention from a police sergeant (Marcus Henderson), and has to recognize his complicity in the growth of a blossoming epidemic.
TWISTER (1996) 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m. on Syfy. A decade before storm chasing became the subject of an ill-fated Discovery Channel reality series, Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt played tornado hunters -- who are also a couple on the brink of divorce -- in this loud thriller. Jan de Bont, fresh off directing "Speed," kept his foot on the gas as he brought to life the quick-moving, Oklahoma-set screenplay, written by Michael Crichton and Anne-Marie Martin, which follows Paxton and Hunt's characters as they deal with maelstroms of both environmental and emotional varieties. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin called the result "a gale-force movie with the energy to blow audiences right out of the theater," writing that Crichton "delivers his familiar mix of hurtling pace, by-the-numbers character development and exotic science." Tornado-chasing "suddenly takes on a sex appeal not usually associated with horrendous storms," she noted.
BATTLE OF THE 80S SUPERCARS WITH DAVID HASSELHOFF 8 p.m. on History. For a more nostalgic view of the '80s than "Snowfall" will give you, hop over to History and watch David Hasselhoff ogle a bunch of cool cars. The climax of the special is a race in which Hasselhoff goes head-to-head with Erik Estrada and Dirk Benedict.
What's Streaming
HARLOTS Stream on Hulu. Samantha Morton and Lesley Manville play warring madams in this period drama, set in the brothels of 18th-century London. The second season finished with what seemed to be an end, as Lydia Quigley (Manville) was sent to a mental institution and Margaret Wells (Morton) was sent to America. The third season, which begins Wednesday, sees Margaret's eldest daughter, Charlotte (Jessica Brown Findlay) taking on more responsibilities. "'Harlots' has a zippy pep, never dwelling too much in its darker realities but also not trying to ignore them completely," Margaret Lyons wrote on The Times's Watching website. "It's a balancing act that mostly works."
ACROSS 110TH STREET (1972) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. The actor Paul Benjamin, who died at the end of June, played supporting roles in movies like "Do the Right Thing" and "Escape From Alcatraz." He was known less as a leading man, but he stars alongside Anthony Quinn and Yaphet Kotto in this crime drama, as the leader of a Harlem bank robbery that goes very awry.

Judge Rejects Justice Dept. Request To Change Lawyers on Census Case

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in New York on Tuesday rejected the Justice Department's request to switch its legal team midway through a case challenging the Trump administration's effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.
The sharply worded order, by United States District Judge Jesse M. Furman, may further hobble an already struggling battle by the administration to save the citizenship question. Efforts to block it have become a crucial political issue as the next census -- and the redrawing of political boundaries in 2021 that will use fresh census data -- draws near.
On Sunday, the Justice Department said it was replacing the legal team defending the citizenship question. It offered no explanation for the change, which came in the middle of a prolonged clash over whether the administration's arguments for adding the question could be believed.
But on Tuesday, as a new team of lawyers began to notify the court of its appearance in the case, Judge Furman barred the old lawyers from leaving until they met a legal requirement to satisfactorily explain their departure and show that it would not impede the case. He excepted only two lawyers on the team who had already left the department's civil division, which was overseeing the lawsuit.
"Defendants provide no reasons, let alone 'satisfactory reasons,' for the substitution of counsel," he wrote, adding that their written assurance that the switch would not disrupt the case "is not good enough."
If the department wishes to continue with the switch of legal teams, the judge wrote, the lawyers must provide sworn affidavits explaining their departures and remain under the court's jurisdiction should they be required to return.
The American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs led by New York Attorney General Letitia James had asked the judge on Monday to block the Justice Department's reassignment of the case without providing a reason for the withdrawal. On Tuesday the group said it still had questions about the move.
"The Justice Department owes the public and the courts an explanation for its unprecedented substitution of the entire legal team that has been working on this case," said Dale Ho, the A.C.L.U.'s lead attorney on the case. "The Trump administration is acting like it has something to hide, and we won't rest until we know the truth."
The Justice Department declined to comment. Mr. Trump took to Twitter late on Tuesday to express his displeasure with Judge Furman's order.
On its face, Judge Furman's order only enforces a court rule governing changes of legal counsel. Practically, however, it presents the department with a difficult choice: Either reverse course and leave its old legal team in place, or produce sworn explanations that could prove both embarrassing and damaging to the administration's case.
The department's legal campaign had already undergone head-snapping changes in strategy this month. Department lawyers first said they were abandoning the case in the face of a Supreme Court ruling blocking the question, only to reverse course the next day, after President Trump called their statement "fake" and said the case would continue. They then told a federal judge that the administration was exploring a "legally available path" to restoring the question.
But that handed opponents of the citizenship question a legal opening: In a motion in Judge Furman's court last week, they argued that the government had repeatedly said the lawsuit had to be resolved by June 30, when the printing of the 2020 census forms had to begin. The department's announcement that it would continue to press for the question in July belied that explanation, opposition lawyers said.
They also suggested that the administration had set a false deadline for resolving the case to keep opponents from uncovering evidence that the citizenship question had been driven by a desire to help the Republican Party gain power when census figures are used to draw new political boundaries in 2021. The challengers said they would pursue sanctions against the defense for its conduct.
The Justice Department announced the switch in legal teams two days later on Sunday. While the department has not explained the change, multiple people familiar with the case have said that the lawyers resigned from the lawsuit out of ethical concerns and a belief that the suit was unwinnable.
Those people have said that many of the lawyers did not see a path forward on the case, given that any argument they made could appear to contradict statements to district judges and to the Supreme Court that the administration had to have a decision by June 30. Just as important, they faced a conflict of interest in trying to represent a client -- the President of the United States -- who had just publicly branded them liars.
But if those explanations were presented to Judge Furman, they would undermine any future arguments made by the Trump administration as it continues to find a way to put the citizenship question onto the census.
"They are absolutely in a bind," said Neal Katyal, a partner at Hogan Lovells and the former acting solicitor general. "They can't answer the question without gutting what Trump and Barr are trying to do. They can try to avoid being forthcoming, which is increasingly the modus operandi of Trump's Justice Department. But that move will fail in the courts, as today's decision indicates."
The census fight has become an embarrassing issue for the Justice Department.
William Barr, the attorney general, told The New York Times on Monday that he believed the department could find a legal path to adding the citizenship question to the census.
Mr. Barr also said he believed the team that had worked on the census question through the Supreme Court ruling had done exemplary work. He added that he had heard from James Burnham, who had been in charge of the case, that a number of lawyers who had been working on the census issue for a long time "probably prefer not to stay at this new phase in the litigation."
"We decided not to put them in that position," Mr. Barr said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Travel Desk Will Buy Carbon Offsets

Texto completo: The issue of travel and climate change has been on my mind since I became The New York Times's travel editor last year. I started on Travel just as we were putting together the annual "52 Places to Go" list and as we were choosing the new 52 Places Traveler, who gets on a plane (numerous planes, actually) and visits each of those places in the course of the year.
This year, Sebastian Modak has been filing his dispatches from far-flung places, including some, like Puerto Rico and the ice caves of Ontario, chosen in part to highlight the effects of climate change on our world.
Several weeks ago, the Travel desk published an article asking this question: If Seeing the World Helps Ruin It, Should We Stay Home? In it, Andy Newman, a Times reporter, grappled with how much one person's travel decisions contribute to global warming, and the news was not good. According to scientists' calculations, a person's share of the emissions on a one-way, cross-country flight from New York to Los Angeles shrinks the Arctic's summer sea ice cover by three square meters, or 32 square feet.
In his article, Andy wrote that while he wasn't going to stop traveling, he was going to start buying carbon offsets when he flew. The idea is that by purchasing offsets you help fund projects that reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by an amount equivalent to the carbon burned by your activity.
The article generated intense interest among readers, with more than 860 comments on our site and additional discussion on social media.
Some thanked Andy for his article and for tackling the issue. Others criticized his decision to buy carbon offsets, saying that they were too little, too late, or said that focusing on the individual traveler lets carbon-polluting industries and the governments that have not done enough to curb carbon emissions off the hook. Some also took broader aim at the idea of simply writing about travel at all, saying that we were encouraging readers to take part in the destruction of the planet.
Their comments amplified issues we have been talking about here.
But travel also has benefits. It provides economic resources and jobs for people, often in places where there are few other prospects. For travelers themselves, there is the delight and magic of discovery, something we on the Travel desk strive to share with our readers every day. And while there are alternatives to flying, not every place can be reached by climate-friendlier means.
We will continue to cover travel, but from here on, the Travel desk is going to offset airplane travel by staff members on assignment, chiefly our 52 Places Traveler and the reporter Tariro Mzezewa. We will be using the platform Cool Effect, which helps travelers fund carbon-mitigation projects across the globe, like planting trees in Africa and India, putting up wind turbines in Costa Rica and creating cleaner cookstoves for use in China.
Reporters on all of The Times's desks travel for work, but the Travel desk is slightly different. We don't have to fly to the scene of an earthquake or a fire or to where the fighting is taking place in a remote theater of war. We are choosing to travel to bring back stories that can encourage others to take similar journeys. We are acknowledging that by committing to buying offsets for our staff.
It is, I know, a small gesture. But it's a start.
I'm eager to keep this conversation going with our readers. Please share your thoughts in the comments; I'll be reading.

Texto completo: My interview with estimable rock 'n' roll critic, editor and author Alan Light predated by several weeks the temper tantrum Taylor Swift had on social media about who bought her record catalog.
Like many big stars, Swift eschews most media interviews while speaking directly to her fans on social media.
The music writer should not be retired just yet, however, Light told me when we discussed Madonna. Earlier this summer, the icon had a meltdown over a profile in the New York Times Magazine. The piece, written by someone professing to be a fan, was a lengthy piece that may have made too many references to Madonna's, let's call it, maturity. Then again, that couldn't have been much of a surprise. The story was headlined: "Madonna at 60."
This is the second part of my interview with Light, who was in Minneapolis doing interviews of his own when he graciously sat down with me to shoot video. The first installment of our discussion appeared in Saturday's paper.
Q: How many hoops did Prince make you jump through for interviews?
A: You can't count those hoops. That first interview, the Vibe cover in 1994 -- it was at least a year-and-a-half process. Repeated meetings and conversations and I'm not allowed to record, not allowed to take notes. I'm running into the bathroom and scribbling on my cuffs, in case this turns out to be something.
It was when "Most Beautiful Girl in the World" was a hit single, the first experiment outside of Warner Brothers, then he [decided]: "Now I've got something to promote. Now we can call it an interview."
[Before that] I don't know what you would call it. Testing? Flirting? But if he calls and says, "Come hang out at sound check," even if we don't end up doing a story, I'll still take that trip.
Q: What are your five favorite songs?
A: I hate questions like that. Albums I can do. Five favorite albums. More Minnesota: Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited" is my favorite album of all time. "Sign o' the Times" is my favorite Prince album, Beatles "Revolver," Public Enemy "It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back." What No. 5 goes on that list today? Joni Mitchell "Blue."
Q: Do Rolling Stone writers have as much freedom as it appears, based on the fact that you can write any curse word you want?
A: [Hearty laughter.] Well, curse words, yes. [More laughter.] There's freedom for that. When I was at Rolling Stone or when I was editing Spin, when I was editing Vibe, that kind of freedom you've got.
I think that the less than absolute freedoms sometimes [involve] "Are you going to want to write something negative about somebody who is sort of a favorite of the magazine?"
Those are the issues. Relationship issues sometimes are at least conversations that you have.
And I've never had a situation of being [told], from any of those places nor when I was running magazines, "You can't do that." But those you look more closely at [to examine]: "Is this going to have some bigger repercussion than if you can use some language you can't use on network news?"
Q: So maybe you won't be surprised that Madonna was hacked off about a NYT writer producing a piece, after a tremendous degree of access, that didn't read like something Madonna's publicity person would write?
A: Listen, the state of profile writing and of entertainment reporting in general, I think, is in a really, let's call it complicated place because these artists have realized that they don't need to go through the press to reach their fans anymore. They can reach them directly through their social media, all kinds of different mechanisms, and so what is the reason that you're going to go to a third party to be able to deliver that story.
Beyonc hasn't done an interview in how many years? Taylor Swift just has kind of done some little ones after not doing anything for the past number of years because they can go to their fans and say exactly what they want to say, rather than go through someone who is going to interpret that.
I still think there is something that you gain from being put in context and given that sort of analysis and treatment. I think there are things that can help artists from that, but I understand them saying, "Why do I need to risk that?"
C.J. can be reached at cj@startribune.com and seen on Fox 9's "Buzz." E-mailers, please state a subject; "Hello" does not count.

VT DMV officials: N.Y. Times got it 'wrong'

Texto completo: A spokeswoman for the Department of Motor Vehicles denounced the portrayal of Vermont in a New York Times article published over the weekend as allowing federal agents to comb through their databases.
"Basically the New York Times story was wrong," Public Outreach Manager for the Vermont Agency of Transportation Amy Tatko said Monday morning. She noted that the practice of giving federal agents access to their database was discontinued in 2017.
Over the weekend the Washington Post and the New York Times published articles exposing Immigration and Customs Enforcement's use of state license databases. They found that ICE made this request of at least three states, one of the two that complied was Vermont. The New York Times article made no mention that Vermont's collaboration ended two years ago.
"Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have mined state driver's license databases using facial recognition technology, analyzing millions of motorists' photos without their knowledge," wrote Catie Edmondson in the July 7 New York Times article.
Agents investigating specific individuals used Vermont's database at least five times between 2014 and 2017 to find photographic matches to suspects under federal investigation, according to internal DMV documents obtained by the Free Press.
Who were federal agents searching for in the drivers license database? Records provided to the Free Press by the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology show there were just four instances of the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Marshals Service asking to use the system all before Gov. Scott put a halt to the program.
In two of the reported uses, the agents and analysts from the Department of Homeland Security were looking for two white males and a white female, all for financial crimes.
In one instance, the US Marshals searched for a "Hispanic Male," which they alleged had violated supervised release, according to the records.
Why did Vermont stop collaborating? In May of 2017, following activism by the Vermont Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, Gov. Phil Scott suspended the practice.
The DMV software and information has not been used or shared with federal agents since May 2017, according to a statement from the DMV.
Two years ago Attorney General T.J. Donovan said the database violates Vermont law and should be suspended, he said on Monday that he still stands by that.
"I have every expectation that the program remains suspended and if it's not then there's going to be a big issue," he said. "I don't support it and I don't support sharing the info with ICE."
Who was using the data? In records provided to the Free Press by the Vermont ACLU, from 2013 through 2017 there were at least 125 instances of the database being used by law enforcement agencies.
Everyone from local Milton, Vermont, police to the Federal Department of Diplomatic Security were given access to the database, according to the records.
The database was used to look for alleged sex offenders, murderers and other criminals.

Texto completo: T. Michael McInnis, the retired president of the General Elevator Co., who was an accomplished skier, died of cardiovascular disease June 26 at Sinai Hospital. The former Howard County resident was 82.
Born in Scranton, Pa., he was the son of Joseph P. McInnis, a Bethlehem Steel engineering executive, and his wife, Lena Dolmesch. He moved with his family to Maryland after his father was transferred to Sparrows Point. He attended Towson High School and later earned his GED while serving in the Army. He trained as a paratrooper, made numerous jumps and was stationed in Munich during the Cold War.
Family members said that while overseas, he enjoyed attending Oktoberfests.
He later earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in business administration at what is now Loyola University Maryland.
Mr. McInnis sold shoes and was a bill collector before he joined General Elevator and worked in its accounting department. He later became vice president of his department and in 1993 became president of the firm. He retired in 2000.
"He was very good with numbers," said Margaret "Marge" Duncan, his companion, who also worked at General Elevator. "He could read down a column of figures with one hand and tap them into into a calculator without looking at the keys. Most everything in life came easy to him. As president, he was low-key and could handle problems calmly."
Said his daughter, Constance "Connie" Morreale of Phoenix, Ariz.: "My father was a stickler for details who could be quirky. At General Elevator, he was not mechanically inclined. He wouldn't know the difference between a flathead and Phillips screwdriver. He was a man of fixed habits. At six o'clock each night on the dot he sat down and had one Scotch. During the day, he set out seven Raisinettes on the kitchen counter. That was his daily allotment. He used the same plastic cereal bowl for 30 years. We finally gave him a new one."
She said her father also had a schedule for walking Columbia's paths. He walked around Centennial Lake and Lake Elkhorn when weather permitted. He disliked cold, windy weather.
She said that after he retired he joined the Dancel YMCA and went to it five days a week. For three days, he worked out on an exercise bike and did strength training, and the other two days he did The New York Times crossword puzzle while he drank coffee and handed out candy.
"My father taught me many things," his daughter said. "He taught me and my sister to appreciate classical music, drive a manual transmission, manage money wisely, and brave the Wild Mouse roller coaster in Ocean City. He was also generous. He'd take us out to dinner and randomly gives us what he called mad money."
Mr. McInnis took up skiing in his 40s.
"Like all of his enthusiasms, when he got into something, he was very enthusiastic," his daughter said. "If he heard the skiing was good somewhere, he took off. He liked the Canadian Rockies, Lake Tahoe and Brian Head, Utah. After the Winter Olympics were held in Sarajevo, he went there and injured himself. He recovered and got back on the slopes. He skied until he was almost 70."
His daughter said Mr. McInnis had a love-hate relationship with the Orioles. He had other pet peeves.
"He thought calamari was tasteless and was like chewy rubber bands. He was no fan of CNN," his daughter said. "He particularly loved telling the same 10 stories over and over again."
Mr. McInnis liked to weigh precisely 180 pounds. When it dropped, he had a milkshake at Duchess Variety Store in Ellicott City.
"It was not like it was medicine," his daughter said. "It was a great excuse to drink a milkshake."
After residing on Greencrest Road in Northeast Baltimore, Mr. McInnis moved to Columbia in 1972. He later lived in Ellicott City and was most recently a resident of the Charlestown Retirement Community.
Services were private.
In addition to his daughter and his companion, survivors include another daughter, Kathleen McInnis-Martens of Incline Village, Nev., and four grandchildren.

By budgeting you are making a plan for your money

Texto completo: One of the seven money habits I often talk about is simply "Make a Plan for Your Money." It's so basic, but so many people don't do it on a regular basis. Another way of saying this — and hang with me here — is you need to make a budget.
I know what you're thinking. Budgeting is so boring! I get that. But, honestly, budgeting gets a bad rap.
I'm as much a free spirit as anyone, so I understand that the thought of sitting down and talking about bills and expenses might sound a little dull. I also understand how a budget might seem very restrictive. But here's a secret about budgeting: Creating a budget will actually give you freedom with your money. It gives you permission to spend! It's one of the amazing principles about money I discuss in my book, Love Your Life Not Theirs.
When you know where every dollar is going, you're prepared. You know what's coming in and what's going out.
When most people start budgeting, they feel like they got a raise. They suddenly "find" money they didn't realize was there. One great result of this is you'll be able to start spending without guilt. All your money is accounted for, so you don't have to worry whether or not your bank account will cover your purchase.
No matter what you've heard, I promise that making a budget isn't difficult. First, simply list your monthly household income before the month begins.
Next, list all your monthly expenses. This should include all your bills, like rent, utilities, basic clothing needs and food, as well as your groceries, eating out, shopping...everything!
Finally, subtract all your expenses from your income. If you've assigned every dollar a name, you should have zero. This is a simple zero-based budget.
When you're making your budget, I recommend using a free app called EveryDollar. It's the best budgeting app out there. It will help you create a plan for your money, while making it easy stay on top of your budget throughout the month.
Don't get discouraged if you mess up a few times. You might need three or four months to get your budget the way you want it. But once you have a plan in place, you'll be amazed at how much more in control you feel about your money. You'll experience more freedom, less anxiety, and a better all-around understanding of your financial situation.
Here's my challenge to you: If you're not living on a monthly budget, give it a try. I bet you'll see a big difference, and you'll never go back to a budget-less life again!

Marijuana gets increased scrutiny after link to psychosis

Texto completo: As Illinois prepares to legalize marijuana next year, one key aspect of public health that regulators will consider is whether and how to limit the amount of THC -- the chief component of cannabis that determines how high users get.
The new law signed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker last month to legalize sales Jan. 1 states that the Department of Agriculture will oversee cannabis growers, including "establishing limits on potency or serving size."
While the vast majority of adult marijuana users consume it without incident, advocates say, the link between THC potency and psychosis has generated increased concern recently among psychiatrists and researchers. Multiple studies have shown a persistent association between marijuana use and psychosis, including schizophrenia, with symptoms such as paranoia and hallucinations.
In March, a study in the British medical journal Lancet went further, and found that daily cannabis use was associated with increased first episodes of a psychotic disorder. The association was even more pronounced for stronger marijuana, with higher levels of THC.
A 2018 study in the Netherlands also found that when potency went up, more people sought drug treatment, and when potency fell, so did the number of patients.
The data fit many of the tests for causality, researchers say, but doesn't prove that cannabis causes psychosis. Some researchers suspect instead that people predisposed to psychosis may be more likely to use cannabis. But as the Yale University authors of a comprehensive research review put it, "... cannabis may be a component cause in the emergence of psychosis, and this warrants serious consideration from the point of view of public health policy."
In response to such findings, the Illinois State Medical Society is calling for per-serving limits on THC, strong warning labels, and a ban on claims of health benefits from cannabis. The society was involved in getting public health precautions written into marijuana legalization, and members hope to be involved in drawing up further regulations.
Medical Society President Paul Pedersen said he's heard from psychiatrists in the state that there has been a noticeable increase of youths coming into emergency departments with acute psychosis from marijuana in the past few years. He supported THC limits, saying, "It would be better to err on the side of being conservative."
Marijuana potency -- measured by the percentage of THC by weight in the total amount of marijuana consumed -- has risen in recent decades. The average strength of stronger strains of confiscated pot doubled from about 8% in the early 1990s to 16% by 2013, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
Efforts have been made to limit THC in other states. In Florida this spring, lawmakers tried but failed to limit the strength of marijuana flower to 10% THC. In Colorado in 2016, advocates pushed for a referendum to limit THC to 16% but ultimately withdrew the plan. Medical marijuana laws in some states only allow low-THC products.
Industry officials argued that the limits would have eliminated most of their products, and would only push demand to the black market, costing jobs and tax revenue.
The Illinois medical marijuana program, operating since 2015, simply limits the amount of THC in edibles, so that a candy bar contains a maximum of 100 milligrams of THC, and is scored into servings of 10 milligrams each.
Cannabis continues to get stronger since legalization. Colorado reported that the average amount of THC in legal marijuana flower there rose from about 16% in 2014 to 20% in 2017.
The products generating the most concern are concentrates -- in which solvents are used to extract THC into waxlike substances -- which are far stronger, and can exceed 80% THC.
In Massachusetts, which recently legalized cannabis, a group of doctors and scientists recently called for strict THC potency limits and warnings on packages to include "increased risk of serious mental illness including psychosis, paranoia, suicidal thoughts, and depression." The group also advocates tracking marijuana transactions to limit how much someone may buy.
But trying to regulate THC percentage is misguided, in the view of Jeremy Unruh, director of public and regulatory affairs for PharmaCann, a multistate cannabis business based in Chicago.
People who use high-THC concentrates are generally experienced users, he said. Smokers feel the effects within minutes, so if it's stronger pot, they simply smoke less. Most overdoses of cannabis, he believes, are due to new users who eat too much.
In states with legal cannabis, such as Colorado, emergency room visits and hospitalizations linked to marijuana use have shot up, often because people try an edible, then eat too much when it doesn't take immediate effect, leading to an overdose -- as famously documented firsthand by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd.
Many weed-related websites offer advice on how to handle a "freak-out," noting that most users will be fine with time, and generally advising to try to relax in a safe place and wait it out, which may take hours or even all day or night.
It's more important, in Unruh's view, to set limits on each serving of edibles, so that users know how much they're taking and start with small amounts until they know what dose is best for them.
"I think it would be counterproductive to limit (THC) potencies until we really know (the effects)," he said. "I think it's dosing -- that addresses the issue."
Cannabis advocates also point out that despite increased use of the product, the incidence of schizophrenia has remained about the same, at less than 1%.
Paul Armentano, deputy director for the advocacy group NORML, acknowledged in an email that marijuana use carries risk particularly for young people and those with a family history of mental illness, which is why the group supports age restrictions and public education.
Such awareness campaigns have helped steadily decrease use, particularly among adolescents, of tobacco and alcohol, which unlike marijuana, kill thousands of people each year.
And legal cannabis has the advantage of lab testing and potency statements on the label, unlike illegal pot.
Armentano also pointed out that the FDA-approved drug Marinol, used to quell nausea, is 100% synthetic THC, but is used safely, without the risk of fatal overdose that opioids have.
Dr. Shalini Varma, a psychiatrist and addiction counselor in Vernon Hills, said she has seen patients who were heavy marijuana users who suffered psychotic breaks, such as a patient thinking the television is talking to him, or that his eyes are filming other people.
"They can't function," she said. But many of her patients won't admit it's a problem. "I treat lots of different drug problems. More than any other drug, they hold onto this."
As for the regulatory process, a spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture could not say what limits the agency will set, but said the emergency rules will be ready, as required, within 180 days of the law's signing -- a deadline which is just days before legal sales are to begin.

Texto completo: St. Louis Post-Dispatch
This is America, 2019.
The women on the U.S. national soccer team, tough and strong, are these forces playing their style uncompromisingly and incomparably — winners winning. As a team, for the team, for their teammates, for their country.
This is America, 2019.
A response to everything this team does comes with a smidgen of smug judging. Like a know-it-all older sibling, so many onlookers — in our lives and online believe they know precisely how this team of women should act, and they’ll be the judges of whether the team fits within their parameters.
This is America, 2019.
Alex Morgan: Celebrity sports star. She’s a sensation, a previous champion, a national hero. She’s ubiquitous and glamorous but still plays her sport with gruff grit. She honors the legacy of the women who played before her. She knows her history and takes pride in making some, too. She has 3.7 million followers on Twitter and countless followers of younger soccer players, girls and boys, who watch and want to play soccer like Alex does.
This is America, 2019.
Alex Morgan: Offensive feather-ruffler. She scored a gorgeous goal in the World Cup semifinal against England — the go-ahead goal and eventual winner — and in a cunning, confident and so-it-seems controversial manner, made a tea-sipping gesture, pinkie out. Her creative celebration fit the times in which a younger generation of athletes flash flamboyance. They work hard, so they celebrate hard. This was an end-zone touchdown dance or some choreographed silliness done by the walk-ons on the end of a college basketball bench, following a big 3-pointer.
But the negative response to Morgan came in a virtual deluge, much from the other side of the ocean, who claimed she disrespected England.
Again, she pretended to sip a cuppa tea.
This is America, 2019.
The most dominant, elegant, highest-level of sport is played by our native daughters.
There was Becky Sauerbrunn, born and raised in St. Louis, extinguishing England’s offensive attacks (except for, it’s only fair to point out, her leg-clipping in the box that led to a penalty kick). Rose Lavelle, strategically toying with defenders, unleashing moves that take multiple buttons to make on a video game. Crystal Dunn, composed on defense, fearless on the occasional burst on offense. And Alyssa Naeher, hoping to someday have a sentence said about her without the words “Hope Solo,” making her own mark as the U.S. goalie, stopping that penalty shot in the 84th minute.
This is America, 2019.
These same women have to fight for equal pay. They sued the United States Soccer Federation, claiming “purposeful gender discrimination.” As Sauerbrunn said in a statement: “It is wrong for us to be paid and valued less for our work because of our gender.”
This is America, 2019.
Our nation showing so much passion for women’s sports. It’s such an exciting time. The front page of last Sunday’s New York Times sports section featured only stories about female athletes: Serena Williams, Maya Moore and soccer star Megan Rapinoe. Across the country, there’s inner-office talk about the soccer game — even watching the soccer game at the office. There are boys wearing the jerseys of their favorite female players. There are sardine bars hosting watch parties.
This is America, 2019.
We’re totally immersed and into women’s soccer ... until we’re essentially not at all, once again. As summer cools into fall, so many sports fans forget about the players they once adored. There is such a jarring disproportion in popularity between international play and professional play. The women play in a league whose acronym you probably couldn’t guess — and for teams you probably didn’t know exist. They’re still the same stars from your beloved national team, but behind clouds.
This is America, 2019.
Rapinoe, the mesmerizing, polarizing goal-scorer, unabashedly proud of her teammates, her own hard work, her family, her girlfriend, her beliefs and her social-justice causes.
This is America, 2019.
Rapinoe, the captain of the America’s national soccer team, having to explain that she’s “extremely American.”
“I think that I’m particularly and uniquely and very deeply American,” she told reporters in France on Wednesday. “If we want to talk about the ideals that we stand for — the songs and the anthem, what we were founded on — I think I’m extremely American.
“I think, for detractors, I would have them look hard into what I’m saying and the actions that I’m doing. Maybe you don’t agree with every single way that I do it, and that can be discussed. I know that I’m not perfect, but I think that I stand for honesty and for truth and for wanting to have the conversation and for looking at the country honestly and saying, ‘Yes, we are a great country, and there’s many things that are so amazing.’ And I feel very fortunate to be in this country. I’d never be able to do this in a lot of other places. But also that doesn’t mean we can’t get better. And it doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t always strive to be better ... for everyone.”
This is America, 2019.

You also can’t wait until Sunday, when your nation’s women’s soccer team plays for the World Cup.

Texto completo: THERE IS SOME sort of hard-to-define spiritual crisis across the land, which shows up in rising depression rates, rising mental health problems. A survey that the Pew Research Center released late last year captures the mood. Pew asked people to describe the things that bring meaning to their lives. A shocking number of respondents described lives of quiet despair:
“I no longer find much of anything meaningful, fulfilling or satisfying. Whatever used to keep me going has gone. I am currently struggling to find any motivation to keep going."
“It would be nice to live according to my being rather than my blackness. I will never know how a totally worthwhile life will feel because of this."
“Drugs and alcohol are the shining rays of light in my otherwise unbearable existence."
“I don't feel very satisfied with my life. I'm a stay-at-home mom and my life is endless monotony and chaos."
The Pew survey reveals a large group of Americans down the income and economic ladders who are suffering from economic scarcity, social scarcity, and spiritual scarcity all at once. Less educated people were less likely to say that friendship was a source of meaning in their lives. They were less likely to say hobbies were a source of meaning, nor was learning, nor good health, nor stability.
When people overall described the sources of meaning in their lives, they stuck close to home. Nearly 70 percent identified family as a source of meaning, followed by career, making money, and practicing a spirituality or faith. Only 11 percent said learning added meaning to their lives. Only 7 percent said helping others was a meaningful part of their life.
If you ask philosophers how people fill their lives with meaning, they usually point to some version of serving a cause larger than self. William James said that meaning was found in tireless struggle on behalf of some sacred ideal. Susan Wolf says that meaning is found in active engagement in important projects.
But the meaning of meaning seems to have changed. When people in this survey describe meaning, they didn't describe moral causes or serving their community, country, or God. They described moments when they felt loved, satisfied, or good about themselves. They described positive personal emotions. As one respondent put it, “It's easy to forget what's wrong in the world when you are pretending to be a puppy with your daughter."
It's as if people no longer see life as something that should be organized around a specific vocation, a calling that is their own way of doing good.
Everything feels personalized and miniaturized. The upper registers of moral life — fighting for freedom, struggling to end poverty — have been amputated for many. The awfulness of the larger society is a given. The best you can do is find a small haven in a heartless world. One respondent said he found meaning in the tiniest things: “Small-scale nature — individual bugs and plants — are quite pleasing. I like to be able to focus on things that don't care about me or the larger world."
I've just finished a four-month tour for my book “The Second Mountain," talking with thousands of people, and I certainly encountered the disillusioned America described in the Pew survey. But the big thing I encountered was the seismic generation gap. People my age rag on the younger generation for being entitled and emotionally fragile, etc. But this generation is also seething with moral passion and rebelling against the privatization of morality so prevalent in the Boomer and Gen-X generations.
They can be totally insufferable about it. In the upscale colleges on the coasts, Wokeness is a religious revival with its own conception of sin (privilege) and its own version of the Salem Witch Trials (online shaming). But the people in this movement have a sense of vocation, moral call, and a rage at injustice that is a legitimate rejection of what came before.
I recently met a group of high school kids from around the United States and Africa involved in the Bezos Scholars program. In our conversations they didn't define their identity by where they were from, or even by their ethnicity and race. They defined themselves by what project they work on — serving Native Americans, working for clean water. Similarly, high school students generally are more likely to define themselves by their political stances and their vocations, rather than whether they are jocks or drama kids.
I've also found that college students are eager to talk about a moral project entirely absent from the Pew survey: Doing inner work, growing in holiness. Many seem to have rediscovered the sense, buried for a few decades, that one calling in life is to become a better person. Your current self is not good enough. You have to be transformed through right action.
It's often uncomfortable and over the top, but we're lucky to have a rebellion against boomer quietism and moral miniaturization. The young zealots may burn us all in the flames of their auto-da-fe, but it's better than living in a society marked by loneliness and quiet despair.

Texto completo: The comic Jacqueline Novak doesn't like the term "oral sex."
"It's very dental," she said with a note of disdain over lunch near the Cherry Lane Theater, where her solo show "Get on Your Knees," a cerebral stand-up meditation on the sexual act, begins performances on July 10. "It's also like saying, 'You know how there's sex? This is the oral version,"' she said, adding: "I see oral sex as its own thing. To me, oral sex seems more intimate than. ..."
Ms. Novak paused, pondering whether to finish her thought, deciding against it, and moving on, before I returned to the subject with a follow-up question: Do you think oral sex is more intimate than intercourse?
"If you're doing it right," she said, with a screwball snap.
Amused at her own chutzpah, she smiled, shifting to a more dutiful explanation of how working on her new hour informs her view: "I spent a year and a half poeticizing oral sex, so it's hard to not think that."
Presenting an elevated take on lewd subject matter is characteristic of Ms. Novak's charmingly eccentric comedy. She regularly veers between confidence and vulnerability, self-conscious pretension and goofy physicality. In her debut on "The Tonight Show," she improvised a 360-degree twirl in the middle of a stand-up set.
Ms. Novak, who recently moved to Los Angeles after many years as a distinctively funny voice in this city's comedy scene, is difficult to pigeonhole, and her new show can be tricky to market. Parts are too obscene to describe in this newspaper, and yet its ambitions might be too highbrow for certain club comedy fans.
In part to illustrate the challenge, Ms. Novak read me the email her director, the comic John Early, wrote to The New York Times photographer in an attempt to avoid an image that leans too hard on a cheap sex joke.
"My goal for the show if I may be so bold is to introduce Jacqueline to the world as a public intellectual," she read, stopping to scream. Then she looks at me: "Can you die?" Then she stared at my recorder and said: "That was my scream."
In a three-plus hour conversation, Ms. Novak came off just like she does onstage: appealingly candid, maddeningly digressive and painstakingly self-aware. She doesn't merely express a thought so much as comment on herself doing it, anticipating your response. "So much of my show," she tells me, "is kind of me saying, 'Don't think I don't know."'
When asked about the focus on oral sex, she said the idea originated in a college essay. But then she detoured. Walking from backstage to the microphone to do stand-up, she said, is similar to moving from a kiss to moving down a body: Everyone knows the thing you're intending to do, she said, "and there's this question hanging in the air: Will she do it well?"
Being observed like this makes her want to talk about it, and her show is in part an investigation of the male gaze, but also a way of coping with it. "I make peace by narrating your experience of me as it's unfolding." Then she paused: "That's the problem with [oral sex]," she said. "You can't narrate it."
Ms. Novak is not a provocateur, but she delights in attention-getting comparisons, counterintuitive arguments and unexpected turns of phrase. I've seen thousands of comics tell jokes about the penis, but she's the first to call it "the nis," and to argue, with rigor, for its peculiar femininity.
After filling out an exercise in "The Artist's Way" about what she would do if she knew she wouldn't fail, Ms. Novak joined an improv troupe at Georgetown University that also included the now-famous comics John Mulaney and Nick Kroll. (Mike Birbiglia, a member a year before, was an early supporter of hers and is a producer of the Cherry Lane show). Once she moved to New York, she had more trouble than her peers getting traction, struggling to break into clubs.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
About eight years ago, at a low moment, she moved back in with her parents in upstate New York and started writing a book about depression, "How to Weep in Public," published in 2016. Once she returned to the city, she met comedians, like Kate Berlant and Mr. Early, who worked in alternative spaces.
"We got along and had a shared sensibility and they didn't [care] about the clubs," she said. "When I started, it was high pressure, people around me getting into clubs, I'm not hitting these markers. Then I start again, and it's more organic."
Ms. Novak said she wants to appeal to club and alt audiences, but mounting her new show -- which tells a personal story, with an arc -- in a theater represents a growing ambition that she hopes leads to a comedy special.
The new act allows for more room to wander, to play with ideas, to move onstage. "Birbiglia once said to me: Some comedians struggle to find ways to be vulnerable, but the thing that's harder for you is to the let the ham in," she said, citing this as critical advice, a turning point.
"From the jump, Jacquelyn was an extremely good writer," Mr. Birbiglia said by phone. "Some of the funniest jokes I've ever heard were written by her." Asked for an example, he quoted one of her first: "I gave my cat a pair of pants, and it was only then that I realized she wasn't wearing a shirt."
Later that night, after the phone call, Ms. Novak wrote to say that she heard he passed along that joke. "I told him I stand by it," she said, "because it's a joke about dignity."

'Strange ... like it's 2008': AOC hits back at Pelosi, accusing her of ignoring American people

Texto completo: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez snapped at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for criticizing her and other left-wing Democrats, renewing a war of words between a rising liberal star and a veteran congressional leader.
"That public 'whatever' is called public sentiment. And wielding the power to shift it is how we actually achieve meaningful change in this country," the 29-year-old New York congresswoman said Saturday about Pelosi — a fellow Democrat who is 50 years her senior — after the California Democrat said Ocasio-Cortez and her inner circle of liberal freshman Democrats were just "four people."
"I find it strange when members act as though social media isn’t important. They set millions of dollars on fire to run TV ads so people can see their message. I haven’t dialed for dollars *once* this year, & have more time to do my actual job. Yet we’d rather campaign like it’s 2008," Ocasio-Cortez added.

In a New York Times interview published Saturday, Pelosi dismissed the influence of Ocasio-Cortez's "Squad," which includes Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts. “All these people have their public whatever and their Twitter world,” Pelosi said. “But they didn’t have any following. They’re four people and that’s how many votes they got.”
This is the latest flare-up between the two Democrats. In April, Pelosi dismissed Ocasio-Cortez and fellow left-wing members of the party as insignificant to the larger Democratic caucus.
“That’s like five people,” the California Democrat told Lesley Stahl. After Stahl pushed back saying the "progressive" movement in the party was larger, Pelosi said she considers herself a progressive.
“Well, the progressive — I'm a progressive. Yeah,” Pelosi said.
Ocasio-Cortez has pushed Pelosi to support liberal policies like her Green New Deal and the push for impeaching President Trump. She has also been quick to criticize the speaker over gestures of bipartisanship.
In June, Ocasio-Cortez condemned Pelosi for approving a vote on a bipartisan border funding relief bill. "Hell no," she said. "That’s an abdication of power we should refuse to accept. They will keep hurting kids if we do."

Texto completo: Usually I go car-free on vacation. This time, I went car-free to vacation.
My wish was to go to San Diego for a long weekend to see my team, the St. Louis Cardinals, play the Padres. And rather than drive to San Diego, I decided to take the train.
The last time I went to San Diego, in 2015, I drove to Encinitas, parked long-term and took the Coaster train to San Diego for the experience, but also to save on hotel parking. Coaster is Metrolink under a different name.
That was a pleasant 50-minute ride. But it made me want to do something more ambitious.
This time I decided to take Amtrak from L.A. Union Station. And to get to Union Station, I took Metrolink.
In other words, I took the train to the train.
This involved a small amount of planning, as I had to find good Amtrak times with a Metrolink train in proximity. Then I booked a modestly priced Gaslamp Quarter hotel — one that wasn’t quite so modest after nearly 20% in taxes — near a trolley stop.
That Friday morning, I drove a few blocks to the Metrolink station in Claremont. But that was the extent of my driving.
As longtime readers know, I’m a fan of public transit and of Metrolink. I enjoy the mild challenge of working out the connections while doing my bit for the environment. Taking transit makes me feel more urban. Plus, riding provides time to read, always a plus.
I got to Union Station more than an hour before my Amtrak train would leave, but that seemed right as I didn’t know about check-in procedures.
With the Pacific Surfliner, it turns out, all you do is board, the same as Metrolink. So I relaxed in a leather chair in the Union Station waiting room until about 20 minutes before departure.
The train was filling up when I did board, and I had lost the chance for a window seat on the second deck. Rookie mistake. Still, the rows are only two seats, so I had a good view regardless.
And the comfort! Compared to airlines, the coach seats are about five inches wider and have about eight inches more legroom.
Which brings up another point: You board without going through a luggage scanner, emptying your pockets, removing your belt and shoes, or submitting to a patdown or nude photo via the body scanner.
You can leave your tray table down the whole trip and use the restroom whenever you like. Now this is a civilized way to travel.
At the first stop, in Fullerton, the passenger at the window seat next to me disembarked. What a break. I scooted over and had a westside window seat the rest of the trip.
After the industrial and business zones came a few patches of agriculture, with pickers working the fields, and the rustic charm of San Juan Capistrano’s Los Rios Street.
South of there, at Capistrano Beach, the surf was perhaps 100 feet away. People could be seen on that shallow stretch of sand walking or sunbathing with books.
After the San Clemente Pier, the train was farther inland, paralleling the 5 Freeway, until the ocean became visible and near again at Solano Beach down a small bluff.
Three hours after leaving Union Station, the Surfliner arrived at the last stop, San Diego’s Santa Fe Depot.
Built in 1915 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style, the depot has twin domes, lots of arches and a waiting room with wooden benches and a soaring ceiling. It’s not too different from Santa Fe’s 1918 depot in San Bernardino.
From the depot, a $5 daily transit pass got me around, as did hoofing it. I saw the Cardinals-Padres game that first night with a San Diego pal. The Cards lost 3-1.
I’m thankful I skipped the next night, when they lost 12-2. A simple loss can be borne stoically, but a humiliation is too much.
Saturday, my friend picked me up to go bowling. He dropped me off, at my request, at Liberty Public Market, a food hall at Point Loma. I cobbled together lunch from multiple vendors and then wondered how I might find my way back to San Diego proper.
But Google Maps did the trick: A short walk took me to a bus stop, and I made that and two further connections seamlessly, arriving in the Hillcrest neighborhood in 40 minutes.
From there it was one block to my destination, Bluestocking Books, a very good used bookstore. I picked up a collection of Red Smith sports columns, unable to resist the blurb on the back from the New York Times: “Red Smith was to sports what Homer was to war.”
Two blocks away was Record City, an equally good record store, from which I bought a Firesign Theatre boxed set.
Three blocks back and I was soon on a bus that dropped me near my hotel.
Incidentally, I had considered my $71 Amtrak round-trip something of a splurge, especially when Metrolink tickets brought the total to $89. But in San Diego, hotels like mine were charging $45 a night for parking. I was there two nights.
Did I come out a buck ahead?
The next morning, I returned to the Santa Fe Depot and took a seat on one of the worn benches. As I did when I boarded in Los Angeles, I kind of wished I’d dressed in a suit, tie and fedora, and maybe had my shoes polished at a shoeshine stand, all for the vintage effect.
An Amish family was among the waiting passengers. The two men wore beards, hats and slacks, the older man in a vest, and the women were in dresses and bonnets. Now that’s a vintage effect.
Learning from my rookie mistake, I stood in line on the shaded platform to get a window seat. That worked out pretty well.
Except a college-age kid soon took the seat in front of me, and reclined it as far as it would go. By this point, all the other window seats were taken.
Even with his lean, I had plenty of room. I read from “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance” while enjoying free wi-fi, free electricity for my phone and the same scenes as before, only in reverse.
At Union Station, with an hour and 15 minutes before my Metrolink train home, I rolled my baggage down Alameda Street for lunch at Philippe, founded in 1908. It was an old-time way to end an old-time trip.

Texto completo: RIVIERA BEACH — One month and a $600,000 ransom later, government operations have largely returned to normal after a ransomware attack that paralyzed the city computer system and every department on which it depended.
The system went down May 29, after someone in the police department hooked a “phishing” email infected with coding that encrypted Riviera Beach computers that controlled everything from phones to email, water utility pump stations, employee paychecks, traffic citations and possibly — the city would not disclose it — police investigation documents.
The attack and the size of the payment the City Council authorized its insurer to make, drew attention nationwide to Riviera Beach, the latest victim of a plague of such attacks, from state capitals to Florida burgs as small as Palm Springs, Stuart and Lake City.
Riviera Beach, a coastal city of 35,000 struggling to right its reputation after scandals toppled its mayor and four out of five council members, found itself featured again in an unsavory light on CNN, CBS, NPR and newspapers from The New York Times to The Wall Street Journal.
The Palm Beach Post reported that, although the City Council authorized the
purchase of a new computer security system for $798,419 on Feb. 20, the system still had not been installed by May 29, when hackers pierced the city's outdated software.
Over the past week, city officials reported their insurer had made the required payment of 65 bitcoins, the untraceable equivalent of about $600,000, and had received a decryption key. The city was on the hook for its deductible, or $25,000. Initial plans to accelerate purchase of new laptop and desktop computers were tabled, as the council decided instead to update that hardware in stages over the next few years, through its annual budget.
Most functions had returned, as the city's information technology staff used the key to regain access to data that had been beyond their grasp. That came as a comfort to many, as the FBI and cybersecurity experts nationwide said paying ransom did not guarantee results.
The city remained tight-lipped throughout the crisis, with officials explaining that the FBI, Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security were investigating.
Amid the national outcry, the city brought in an outside public relations team, which did not return messages.

Trump's N. Korea reality show is just bad theater

Texto completo: President Donald Trump loves big foreign policy events that draw the nation's attention to – well, President Donald Trump.
He went to London recently for the spectacle of dining with the queen, ignoring the fact that he could have no meaningful discussions with her government, which is in a state of transition. He also savors his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the outrage they draw merely amps up the attention. But nothing is like his approach to North Korea, where he'll apparently do anything, potentially even undermining America's interests, for the coverage it brings.
As the result of a tweet, the foundation of a lot of his on-the-go policymaking, Trump met with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un on Sunday to announce the reopening of nuclear talks.
To Trump, the get-together was a grand spectacle. Not only has he already become the first U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader, he did so this time on North Korean soil, also a first. But he has been down this road before with little result. When Trump first met with Kim, in Singapore, he also drew the world's attention. Then after a second meeting in Vietnam, the talks broke off. Now he's at it again.
There's more here than self-promotion, though. In constantly providing a stage for Kim, Trump is giving him legitimacy and global standing that he most assuredly does not deserve. Making matters worse, Trump is, according to The New York Times, considering recognizing North Korea as a nuclear power and merely asking for it to freeze its arsenal, rather than giving it up. That's a step back from last year, when Kim promised to denuclearize.
Not that it is likely Kim would follow through with either. North Korea has a long history of reneging on pledges to eliminate or freeze its nuclear weapons program. To give Kim so much upfront now, in hopes that he'll reform his ways, is unwise. Other rogue nations will be encouraged to develop their own nuclear arsenals.
Indeed, Iranian leaders, who signed a deal to freeze their nuclear program in 2015, have to see the way their nation is being treated even as Trump coddles North Korea. Making a nuclear deal without weapons in hand has left Iran vulnerable to renewed sanctions from an administration hellbent on blowing up the agreement. On Monday, Iran's foreign minister announced that his country had exceeded the enrichment caps set down by the accord.
Now, instead of one nuclear headache in North Korea, Trump's diplomacy has resuscitated a second, making each more difficult to address.

A Stop at Moe's, Long After It's Got No Moe

Texto completo: Moe Moskowitz, the co-founder of Moe's Books in Berkeley, was known for a lot of things: his omnipresent cigars; his appalling dancing (sometimes to Cab Calloway on the store's turntable); his political activism; and especially the way he held court at the cash register, riffing like Jackie Mason at a Friars Club podium.
The more you know about Moskowitz (1921-1997), who opened the store in 1959, the Beatnik era, with his wife, Barbara, the more you want to know. He was brusque and a bit of a slob. He drove his sports car like a maniac. One of his former employees has written about his "famous flatulence."
He was a natural-born agitator. Born in New York City, he realized he missed certain eats while out West. He's been given credit for bringing real bagels into Berkeley after founding SAWBABA, the Society for the Advancement of Water Bagels in the Bay Area, in 1962.
After he was referred to as a "balding intellectual" in a newspaper article, he founded, in mock outrage, another group: S.F.D.B.I. -- the Society for the Defense of Balding Intellectuals. (Sign me up.) He helped finance albums by Country Joe and the Fish, the Berkeley-based psychedelic band perhaps best known its performance of "I Feel Like I'm Fixin to Die Rag," a Vietnam War protest song, at Woodstock.
I could keep going about Moskowitz. If you want to know more, look for a copy of "Radical Bookselling: A Life of Moe Moskowitz," a short, fond biography by his daughter, Doris Jo Moskowitz. She now runs Moe's.
Under her watch the store has only gotten better. It remains a landmark, one of America's very best bookstores and worth an epic detour to visit. It still feels a bit raffish, in the best sense. Moe's four floors are packed with more than 200,000 new and used books, with copious sections on academic topics like Medieval Studies and philosophy.
New and used books are shelved together (as dream-bookstores always do it), and the store's rare book room is a sprawling cabinet of wonders. The store it will most resemble, for Easterners, is The Strand in Manhattan.
The San Francisco Chronicle once put it this way: "India has the Taj Mahal. Berkeley has Moe's."
Moe's began its life on as a small shop on Shattuck Avenue. In the 1960s, it moved to its current location on Telegraph Avenue, four blocks from the University of California at Berkeley campus.
It arrived there during the midst of roiling antiwar and other demonstrations. Moe's sells a remarkable poster, taken in front of the store, of a protester hurling an object while surrounded by tear gas. The Moe's logo is clearly visible in the background. Moe's was known as a place where protesters could hide out for a bit if the action got too intense.
Dissent was in Moe's blood. When he was younger he was among the picketers arrested in 1945 for calling for the release of from prison of conscientious objectors. His sandwich board read: "Federal Prisons -- American concentration camps."
He had a flair for the dramatic. In 1952, Judith Malina, the co-founder of the Living Theater, cast Moskowitz in the first American production of "Ubu Roi," Alfred Jarry's absurdist play.
"He was not a beautiful man," Doris Moskowitz wrote about him in her book, "but a beautiful human being."
Both generations of Moskowitzs have an eye for talent. The novelist Jonathan Lethem worked at Moe's for several years. Current staffers Owen Hill and Anthony Dean Rizzuto have edited authoritative annotated editions of Raymond Chandler's work. The store has several shelves filled with books by store alumni.
"Moe's is a unique store," Doris Moskowitz told me. "We have employees who in many cases have been with us for a long time. They really care about the place, and we offer them a lot of autonomy. The many decisions we make don't come from above -- there's a collective spirit."
The store, the largest in the Bay Area, has 25 employees and is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. The Moskowitz family owns the building on Telegraph.
"The biggest thing that changed since Moe died is probably that we're a little nicer," Doris Moskowitz told me. "Early on I would get in trouble with the staff for being too upbeat, for saying hello, for asking customers if they wanted a bag. I was told, 'You don't have to ask them, they're adults!' "
Doris Moskowitz sometimes asks herself, she told me, "WWMD?" (What Would Moe Do?) She makes decisions she can imagine him disagreeing with. It's her store now. "I did have a dream," she said, " in which he gave me the fish eye."
She isn't sure that Moe's wild days are entirely behind it. "I've heard stories about people bragging about private moments in the store elevator," she said. "Perhaps these are just rumors. I have no idea, and I'm not sure I want to know."
"Books Territory" is an occasional column on the bookstores we love.

Texto completo: Self-help author Marianne Williamson and former tech executive Andrew Yang have met the benchmarks to get on the next Democratic debate stage.
The two lesser-known candidates are among 14 contenders who have secured spots at the July 30 and 31 debates in Detroit, which will feature 10 candidates each night, according to a New York Times analysis.
Party rules state that to qualify, candidates must have at least 65,000 campaign donors and reach at least 1% support in three recognized polls. The crowded field of 24 candidates has prompted some party insiders to call on the lower-tier candidates to drop out.
Yang and Williamson have struggled to get attention, with Yang claiming that his microphone wasn't even on at times in last month's debate. Williamson complained Wednesday that she was deliberately excluded from a Vogue magazine photo essay on 2020 female Democratic candidates.
The other candidates certain of a debate spot are Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Vice President Joe Biden, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Peter Buttigieg, and former Housing Secretary Julian Castro.Story URL

Texto completo: 2019 ha sido un año nefasto por la cantidad de muertes en accidentes viales en NYC y como medida para prevenir más tragedias la ciudad ratifica una gran expansión de las cámaras de velocidad, en cantidad y ubicación.
La alcaldía anunció que la medida, que busca cumplir los límites de velocidad y mejorar la seguridad en general, ya no se limitará a zonas escolares, sino será extendida a todo tipo de vías concurridas, en casi todos los vecindarios de la ciudad, informó The New York Times.
El plan creará la red más grande de cámaras de velocidad automatizadas de la nación, con más de 2 mil, cubriendo 750 zonas.
“Significará que usted tendrá que conducir a una velocidad segura en Nueva York, donde nuestros conciudadanos caminan, van en bicicleta y usan las calles”, dijo la comisionada de transporte, Polly Trottenberg.
Pero los críticos dicen que se está utilizando la seguridad como una fachada para “vigilar con fines de lucro”. Las cámaras que capturan un vehículo que se desplaza a más de 10 millas por hora (mph) por encima del límite pueden generarle a la ciudad $50 dólares a través de una multa enviada por correo al propietario del vehículo.
“La ciudad de Nueva York sólo se convertirá en una gran trampa de velocidad”, dijo Shelia Dunn, de la Asociación Nacional de Automovilistas (NMA) , un grupo de defensa popular que se opone a las cámaras. “Hacer que todas las calles de Nueva York se conviertan en una zona de velocidad escolar no protegerá realmente a las personas”, afirmó.
La medida es parte del conocido plan “Vision Cero” del alcalde Bill de Blasio para disminuir los accidentes.
Hasta finales de abril, las muertes por accidentes viales ya habían subido 30% con respecto al mismo período el año pasado. Ello promedia un fallecido cada dos días.

Tight Race for Last Slots In Next Debates, and Bar Is Only Getting Higher

Texto completo: With just four weeks to go until the second set of Democratic presidential primary debates, a handful of lower-tier candidates are in danger of missing them. A single percentage point of support in one poll could be the difference between getting invited to Detroit and being left off the debate stage.
A New York Times analysis of donor and polling data shows that as of Wednesday, seven candidates seeking the Democratic nomination are actively fighting for six slots in the coming debate, which again will be split over two nights, July 30 and 31.
So far, 14 candidates have qualified both by getting campaign donations from 65,000 people and by garnering at least 1 percent support in at least three qualifying polls. These candidates, listed below, are guaranteed one of 20 spots on the stage.
Seven additional candidates, six of whom took part in last week's debates, have qualified only by one of two metrics -- meeting the polling threshold -- meaning they are on the bubble and the Democratic National Committee's tiebreakers will come into play.
[Who's running for president? Keep up with the 2020 field with our candidate tracker . ]
At the moment, former Representative John Delaney of Maryland, former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio appear to have an advantage over the other four. Each of them has at some point earned 2 percent support in a qualifying poll, which raises their polling averages. (For the purposes of the tiebreaker, the D.N.C. will average each candidate's best three polls.)
That leaves Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York and Representative Eric Swalwell of California in a virtual deadlock. Mr. Bullock is the only candidate in this group who did not debate last week. All four men appear to have the exact same polling average: 1 percent.
The D.N.C. anticipated that this might happen, and officials said that in the event of a tie, they would rank the candidates based on "the total number of polls in which each candidate received 1 percent or more support." By our count, Mr. de Blasio has eight such polls, Mr. Bennet has six, Mr. Bullock has five and Mr. Swalwell has three.
[What we learned from the first round of Democratic presidential debates.]
That's why the results of polls released in the next couple of weeks will be so important to those candidates. Each will be hoping to increase his polling average, add another 1 percent result to his tally, or both.
Three more candidates -- Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Fla.; Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts; and former Representative Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania -- do not appear to have qualified for the debate via donors or polling. Though there is still time for that to change, those candidates will face an uphill battle for a spot on the stage, even if they manage to qualify.
Mr. Moulton is in particularly bad shape: He has been in the race for more than two months but has not reached 1 percent in a single qualifying poll, according to the Times analysis. Aside from Mr. Sestak, who announced his campaign less than two weeks ago, Mr. Moulton is the only candidate in the 24-person field with this dubious distinction.
[Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren gained ground in a series of post-debate polls.]
The 14 candidates who have locked in a spot on the July debate stage by qualifying through both donors and polling, in alphabetical order, are: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; the former housing secretary Julián Castro; Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Senator Kamala Harris of California; Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington; Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas; Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont; Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; the self-help author Marianne Williamson; and the former tech executive Andrew Yang.
Who could get cut from the third debate?
An even larger group of candidates is expected to be left off the stage for the third debate in September. The D.N.C. raised the qualification thresholds for it significantly.
Candidates will need to have at least 130,000 donors and earn 2 percent support in at least four qualifying polls. And this time they will have to meet both standards to make the cut.
We surveyed the campaigns last month, and while most did not provide data on unique donors, a few did. Based on that information and what has been publicly released by the campaigns, we know that seven candidates have already met the donor requirement.
[Which presidential candidates raised the most money this spring?]
Five of those seven -- Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Harris, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren -- have routinely eclipsed 2 percent support in the polls and will presumably meet the polling requirement with ease. They are all but certain to earn a spot on the stage in September. A sixth, Mr. O'Rourke, also has a track record of achieving 2 percent or higher in the polls, but a pair of post-debate surveys this week had him at 1 percent.
Mr. Yang's campaign announced Monday that he had also exceeded 130,000 donors, making him the seventh candidate to do so. But Mr. Yang's support in the polls has wobbled between 0 and 2 percent, and it is not clear whether he will achieve 2 percent four times in a two-month window.
The D.N.C. has said that only polls publicly released between June 28 and Aug. 28 can be used to help candidates qualify for the September debate. That means all the candidates have started counting again from zero.
Candidates like Mr. Booker and Ms. Klobuchar often poll at 2 percent and above and may very well reach the polling threshold. But they could struggle to get to 130,000 unique donors.
For just about everyone else, both the polling and donor thresholds present a significant challenge. Just this week, Politico reported that Mr. Hickenlooper had only 13,000 donors.
So, it would not be at all surprising if the September debate ends up featuring 10 candidates or fewer.
"The new 130,000-donor debate threshold is designed to cut candidates like me from the running," Mr. Castro wrote in an email to supporters days after the new debate qualification criteria were released. "But let me make one thing perfectly clear: I have never accepted defeat without a fight -- and I have no intention of starting now."
Fourteen candidates are assured a spot in the next round of Democratic debates on July 30-31 in Detroit. For the rest, it's tricky. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)

Two Voice Recorders, Because Politicians Talk

Texto completo: How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Nicholas Fandos, a reporter in Washington who covers Congress, discussed the tech he's using.
What are the most important tech tools for doing your job?
At its simplest, reporting on Congress is about creating a record of what the people's elected representatives say and do when it comes time to make laws, question witnesses and confront crises facing the country. So the most important tools as I chase after senators and representatives are simple voice recorders. I usually have two on me at all times to be safe. One is my iPhone and the other an old-school Olympus Voice Recorder WS-852 in silver. That way, if I need to, I can have the Olympus recording in one hand while I type a quote or even a tweet on my phone in the other.
My fellow congressional reporters and I are also swooning over Otter, which is technically a voice recording app. It transcribes in real time what is being recorded and sends both the audio and the transcript to the cloud. I can then log in on my computer, easily grab a quote out of the transcript and pull it straight into a story.
With 535 members of Congress, two chambers, dozens of hearings a day and a fire hose of possible stories, a lot of energy goes into being in the right place at the right time to get the material I need. I also rely on a few built-in resources to help wade through the mess. For one thing, the House and Senate each operate press galleries that will send reporters vote and hearing schedules, transcripts of leader remarks, and the text of bills under consideration -- a daily godsend.
But in the House, the majority leader's office operates a nifty app called Dome Watch. It has schedules for the day and week, gives live updates on what is happening on the House floor -- including a vote tracker and video feed -- and will send you push notifications when votes are called once or twice a day.
Washington reporters often say the best tech is no tech: A face-to-face conversation with a confidential source is the most secure form of communication. But to play devil's advocate, aren't you just as likely to be followed around as you are to be digitally surveilled?
The beauty of reporting in the Capitol complex is that there is both a high level of built-in security and always plausible deniability. So when, say, I'm able to pull aside a congresswoman or her aide to confirm a secretive detail about an investigation into President Trump, no one really thinks twice. Everyone on Capitol Hill, it sometimes seems, is locked in a hushed conversation.
So I spend a lot of time -- sometimes hours -- roaming the tangled hallways of the Capitol basement or attached office buildings just to get in the right position to run into someone and ask that key question. Luckily no one follows me.
I suspect that may not be as easy for my colleagues who cover institutions less accessible to reporters than Congress. And I, like them, still do make use of encrypted messaging apps, like Signal, to exchange sensitive information.
When you and others reported this year on the Mueller report , which was hundreds of pages long , what tools did you use to comb through it so quickly?
Processing a dense 448-page report in real time -- after almost two years of detailed reporting and exhausting anticipation -- presented a huge logistical challenge. Luckily our team of editors had an idea built around the principle of divide and conquer.
They worked with our in-house developers and designers to build the right platform and work flow that allowed reporters to pull out key excerpts from the report as soon as the Justice Department released it, paste them in a Slack channel, add our commentary and analysis and then race them onto The New York Times's website, where readers could quickly assess the key takeaways. To make things go faster, the editors assigned each reporter a smaller section to comb through and helped produce a version of the report that we could easily search for key figures or terms.
At the end of the day, there is no way around reading a blockbuster narrative report like this one in full for yourself. For that, there's nothing preferable to fat ink-on-paper printouts.
What tools do lawmakers use the most? And which lawmakers are the early adopters of tech?
In Congress, the technology gap can be as gaping at the age gap. Some senior senators can barely operate their smartphones -- or, in the case of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, take pride in exclusively using a flip phone. Others routinely fire up Facebook Live to take questions from constituents back home.
It seems most lawmakers, like most of us, use technology for two simple purposes: to pack more into their 14-hour days and to connect with people they care about, namely their constituents. Most members of the House and Senate, for instance, now have Instagram accounts in addition to Twitter and Facebook accounts, where they can post pictures of themselves meeting with constituents or making fiery speeches. (Senator Angus King of Maine shoots all his own pictures and has quite a knack for it.)
Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Chris Murphy of Connecticut are big Twitter aficionados, typing out their takes on the news in 280 characters and peppering their work in Washington with politically charged quips. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who conducts a lot of business on the phone while on the move throughout the Senate, was one of the first people I ever saw using AirPods.
Less visibly, of course, Big Data is reshaping the ways campaigns are waged and won.
What tech products do you love when you're off the job?
I am a committed Luddite in my personal life. Let me put it to you this way: My current tech obsession is a standard iPad that my girlfriend recently received as a gift. I feel a lot of kinship with older people as I punch away with two fingers at night and flip through articles I didn't have time for during the day.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday promised military tanks along with "Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!" for the Fourth of July in Washington. But District of Columbia officials said "Tanks, but no tanks" and complained that Trump is politicizing what traditionally has been a nonpartisan celebration.
White House and administration officials have tried to calm those concerns by stressing that Trump plans to deliver a patriotic speech at the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday during his "Salute to America" event that is billed as honoring the US armed forces.
But one of Trump's closest White House advisers strayed from that reasoning when asked to preview his remarks.
Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Tuesday the speech would cover "how wonderful this country is, our troops and military, our great democracy and great call to patriotism, the success of this administration in opening up so many jobs for individuals, what we've done for veterans."
Trump tweeted Tuesday: "Big 4th of July in D.C. 'Salute to America.' The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people, among other things, the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!"
But not everyone is on board.
The military appreciates national recognition, but some members worry that they will be seen as political props. This concern has been heightened during Trump's administration by his repeated focus on showcasing the military as the main symbol of US power and influence in the world.
The District of Columbia government previously complained about damage that tanks would do to city streets and reissued its complaint on Monday after The Washington Post reported on Trump's plan to station tanks in the city.
"We have said it before, and we'll say it again: Tanks, but no tanks," the City Council tweeted. The tweet included an image of a Defense Department memo from 2018 that suggested only wheeled vehicles be used to minimize damage to streets from 60-ton tanks.
Thursday's events are also expected to include military flyovers by the Navy's Blue Angels, F-22 fighter jets, and possibly other military aircraft.
The annual fireworks display will be held near the Lincoln Memorial instead of its usual location by the Washington Monument.
A ticket-only area in front of the memorial is being set aside for VIPs, including members of Trump's family, friends, and members of the military, the White House said.
Associated Press
Trump, RNC report raising $105m in second quarter
WASHINGTON — President Trump's reelection campaign and the Republican National Committee on Tuesday said they had raised $105 million in the second quarter of this year, outraising former president Barack Obama in the equivalent period during his reelection campaign in 2012 and signaling that Trump will have vastly more resources than he did in 2016.
The campaign and the RNC said they had a combined $100 million in cash on hand, and that they had raised more money online in the second quarter than in the first half of 2018. Trump and his committees raised $54 million, they said, and the RNC raised $51 million. The staggering figure can be plowed into television and digital advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts and other activities related to the 2020 election.
Campaign officials said they received 725,000 individual donations online, with supporters giving an average of $48. In some cases, they said, people may have given more than once.
An RNC official said the small-dollar enthusiasm for Trump was something unprecedented in Republican politics, and noted that for the first time ever, the RNC attracted a larger share of donations under $200 than the Democratic National Committee.
At the same time, as president, Trump also has command of the party's donor base in a way he never did in 2016. The official said the RNC also saw a large uptick in traditional party donors, which increased to more than one-third of the committee's total fund-raising since last cycle.
The RNC has taken the lead on fund-raising for Trump's reelection, overseeing the digital efforts and major donor events.
The official report on the Trump campaign's finances for the quarter, which will include spending, will be filed with the Federal Election Commission on July 15.
In 2011, during the same period, Obama's reelection campaign raised $47 million, and the Democratic National Committee brought in $38 million, Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager, said at the time. The comparisons are not perfect because a 2014 Supreme Court case and other legal changes allowed candidates and parties to form joint fund-raising committees that can accept single donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Trump says NRA will move to Texas to avoid New York
President Trump predicted the National Rifle Association would soon move to Texas to flee “harassment" by the New York state government, although the organization is not based in the Empire State.
The NRA's headquarters is in Fairfax, Va.
The NRA is loved in Texas, Trump said in a series of tweets Tuesday, the second day in a row he has used Twitter to accuse New York officials of targeting political opponents, causing businesses and organizations to leave the state.
New York Attorney General Letitia James opened an investigation into the gun-rights group's nonprofit status in April. The NRA, which was first chartered in New York in 1871, is suing the state's financial regulator, claiming its investigation into the organization's insurance products is part of a vendetta led by Governor Andrew Cuomo, a frequent critic.
Cuomo “uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes," Trump said in a tweet Monday. “They sue on everything, always in search of a crime."

Texto completo: New Coke is a smashing success? Has our world turned upside down?
Sort of.
The sweeter version that 34 years ago was positioned to send the original Coca-Cola recipe to retirement is on a temporary comeback trail thanks to the third season of "Stranger Things," which is set to debut Thursday.
Season 3 of the Netflix series is set in 1985, the same year that New Coke debuted to much fanfare, crashed due to consumer reluctance and pushed to the back of the grocery shelf by the original recipe. This all happened within a span of a little over two months.
New Coke reportedly will be featured along with Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Will (Noah Schnapp) and the rest of the gang as they traverse another creepy adventure tied to the Upside Down. "It was one of the first ideas in our Season 3 brainstorm," the Duffer Brothers, the show's creators, told The New York Times in an email interview.
"It was the summer of '85, and when you talk about pop culture moments, New Coke was a really big deal. It would have been more bizarre to not include it."
Coca-Cola has also made available a limited edition of 500,000 "Stranger Things"-themed cans. But you'll have no luck finding it at your local grocerystore. The new New Coke can be purchased in a manner that wasn't available back in 1985 through the company's website. Free samples also will be available at special events around the country, according to the website.
Coca-Cola had to dig through its archives to find the New Coke recipe, according to the Times. The company, as well as Netflix, told the publication that no payment was made for the product placement in the show. Netflix, however, said it had reached agreements with 75 brands to promote one of its most popular series.
New Coke was never officially given that name. Instead it was simply called Coke as its new concoction replaced the old, which by 1985 had been losing market shares to diet colas and other soft drinks.
The negative reaction to the original run of New Coke included boycotts, letter-writing campaigns and thousands of calls to Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta.
The company responded by going back to the original recipe, which was rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic. New Coke remained Coke until it was renamed Coke II in 1992, and then discontinued in 2002.
A number of reviewers who ordered the limited edition cans from the Coke website asked the company to bring back New Coke permanently.

State golf fans remember Reed's Ryder Cup pluck

Texto completo: The two Sundays that define Patrick Reed's career were as different as a primal scream and a golf clap.
On Oct. 2, 2016, Reed helped turn Hazeltine National into a mosh pit, waving his arms and cupping his ear while beating Rory McIlroy and leading the United States to its only Ryder Cup victory since 2008.
On April 8, 2018, Reed outplayed McIlroy in the final pairing and parred the last four holes to win the Masters for his first major championship.
At Hazeltine, Reed became Captain America, a player who elevated his game when playing for country and with countrymen.
At Augusta National, he became a more complex story, winning in the city where he spent part of a divisive college career, with his parents in town but not invited to the course.
At Hazeltine, Reed exhorted his teammates and the crowd. At the Masters, he spent the morning at the end of the practice range, speaking only to his caddie as other players socialized. Then he prevailed in front of "patrons" who seemed to favor McIlroy.
This week, Reed returned to Minnesota for the first time since the Ryder Cup to play in the 3M Open. Tuesday, he played the back nine of TPC Twin Cities during a practice round with Rory Sabbatini.
None of the emotions expressed Tuesday were complex. Fans treated Reed as a conquering hero as he signed dozens of autographs and traded fist-bumps with children.
"It's awesome," Reed said. "Feels amazing to be back. Great memories, obviously, from Minnesota and Hazeltine, and trying to feed off the awesome crowds, the awesome people and the awesome experience we had the last time we were up here."
Reed might be the most interesting man in golf. In college, he angered teammates. In 2014, having yet to win a major, he described himself as a "top-five" player in the world.
At Hazeltine, he teamed with Jordan Spieth to spearhead the American victory, and when Ryder Cup captain Jim Furyk broke up the pair in 2018, Reed guessed the decision reflected Spieth's wishes and ripped Spieth and Furyk to the New York Times.
Reed is not a closed-mouthed, cap-tipping clich many golfers pretend to be. He doesn't hide his ambitions or emotions, and doesn't seem to care if he's universally popular.
Which makes him fascinating, especially if you were one of the tens of thousands who watched him spur beer sales at Hazeltine in 2016.
Asked his favorite memory from Hazeltine, Reed said: "Us winning? I mean, it was my first time playing on a Ryder Cup team that won. My first year, I felt like I played really well, but we were overseas and we ended up losing. So even though my record was good over there at Gleneagles [Scotland, in 2014], at the end of the day you want the team to win. It didn't feel that great.
"To win our first Ryder Cup at Hazeltine was amazing, especially being the first one on home soil, and on top of it the way we did it and the way I played when I was playing against Rory. How we were going back and forth with each other but at the same time there's a good friendship between us and we were having a good time doing it.
"So we were showing not just our patriotism for each player but also the camaraderie and respect we have for each other."
Asked his current career goals, Reed spoke of putting himself in contention more often on Sunday afternoons, then said: "Win more golf tournaments. Of course, I want to win more majors. Ultimately, I would like to win the career grand slam."
If he wins this week, Captain America will earn a subtitle: Mr. Minnesota.
"I was very excited to come back here," he said. "Flying into the same airport, it was an awesome feeling to be back. Ever since the beginning of this week, being out here, the fans have been awesome and the people have been great and I look forward to getting started."
Thursday, Reed will play in the first round of the inaugural 3M Open, but he's not starting over. If Tuesday was an indication, Minnesotans remember.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
OPHELIA (2018) Stream on IFC Films. Imagine if Shakespeare's "Hamlet" were told from Ophelia's perspective. This film, directed by Claire McCarthy, follows Ophelia (Daisey Ridley), a Danish orphan who becomes a lady in waiting to Queen Gertrude (Naomi Watts). Soon she and a young Prince Hamlet (George MacKay) fall in love. But Ophelia's devotion is tested as Hamlet's desire to avenge his father's death overtakes him. In her review in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote: "'Ophelia' seeks to revamp the image of its title heroine as a tragic, largely passive casualty, one who is as much a victim of Shakespeare's era as of his peerless imagination. It's an interesting exercise and, for the most part, a passably diverting one."
THE LAST CZARS Stream on Netflix. It's been over a century since the Romanovs ruled Russia, yet the public's fascination with their rise and fall remains strong. This docuseries delves into the family's history and focuses on Nicholas II, the last Russian imperial ruler. The six-part show, which weaves re-enactments, archival footage and interviews into its scripted narrative, explores how Nicholas II's resistance to change led to a revolution and, ultimately, his death and the slaughter of his family in 1918.
PETERLOO Stream on Amazon. It was one of the bloodiest incidents in British history. In August 1819, around 100,000 working-class people gathered for a peaceful meeting in St. Peter's Field in Manchester, England, to protest their disenfranchisement and to campaign for universal suffrage. But the meeting turned violent when volunteer soldiers attacked the demonstrators. Hundreds were injured. The number of people who were killed is disputed. The film, directed by Mike Leigh, stars Rory Kinnear, Maxine Peake and Neil Bell.
PHOENIX (1998) Stream on Hulu. Harry Collins (Ray Liotta) is a cop with a gambling problem. When his debts get out of control, his bookie (Tom Noonan) demands that he pay up. With no money to offer, Collins decides to rob a loan shark (Giancarlo Esposito), enlisting the help of his partner (Anthony LaPaglia) and a pair of crooked cops (Daniel Baldwin and Jeremy Piven). But when the robbery doesn't go as planned, things get even more complicated.
What's on TV
NCIS: THE CASES THEY CAN'T FORGET 9 p.m. on CBS. Samira Watkins was 25 when she vanished in 2009. Five days later, her body washed up in a duffel bag outside the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida. The authorities eventually connected circumstantial evidence to Watkins's boyfriend, Zachary Littleton, who was a Navy police officer. Littleton was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Now, Littleton has agreed to talk publicly for the first time about the case and insists he's innocent. The episode, "Death of a Dream," also features interviews with journalists, members of Watkins's family, lawyers and police officials who were involved in the investigation.

Rapinoe deserves credit, but the trailblazers she's following should get the same

Texto completo: It was August 2016 when Colin Kaepernick, then quarterback of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers, refused to stand for the ritualistic pregame rendition of the national anthem in protest of police lethality against unarmed black men. A month later, Megan Rapinoe did the same before a National Women's Soccer League game.
Kaepernick eventually was run out of football for his audacious protest and left to sue for wages he thought were taken from him as punishment.
Rapinoe continued to support what Kaepernick started, demonstratively and vocally, with the support of her employer, including U.S. Soccer, for whom she is starring on the pitch at the Women's World Cup in France and being lauded off it for her unflinching criticism of the Trump administration.
The Wall Street Journal on Monday championed Rapinoe - who did not play in Tuesday's 2-1 semifinal win against England because of a hamstring injury - as confident and outspoken. The New York Times said Saturday she is the leader of this moment.
We in the media lauded her support for the LGBTQ community, of which she is a part, as well as for her amplifying the call for the women's national team to be paid the same as the men's.
The Atlantic even deemed Rapinoe "her generation's Muhammad Ali." But it was Kaepernick, with whom Rapinoe allied, who like Ali lost his job because of his activism and was left to seek relief in court.
Kaepernick is black; Rapinoe is white. We've even championed her as the first white athlete to have Kaepernick's back. As such, we would be negligent if we did not wrap the monument we appear to be on the verge of erecting to Rapinoe for her fearless speaking of truth to power, or merely continuing what Kaepernick began, in the prophylactic of white privilege.
It certainly could be considered that Rapinoe's surviving, if not thriving, as an impassioned supporter of a stance taken by a black man, who was ostracized and vilified for it, has something more to do with her gender or maybe even her sport. But history suggests otherwise.
For example, despite blossoming into a near-20-points-per-game scorer, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf's NBA career was short-circuited in the 1990s after he stopped celebrating the national anthem, citing its conflict with his Muslim faith.
Most infamously, Ali was stripped of his license to make a living as a professional boxer and convicted by the U.S. government for refusing conscription into the Army as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War.
Not long after, John Carlos and Tommie Smith were run out of the Olympics, and nearly American society, for protesting on the 1968 Summer Games medal stand to bring attention to human rights abuses.
It also has not been unusual for white athletes to be exalted for actions for which black athletes were dismissed at best or excoriated at worst. For example, over the years, starting in the 1990s, a handful of black football and basketball players suggested out loud that college athletics should give them more than room, board and tuition. But it was a white, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Johnny Manziel, whom Time magazine made a cover boy in 2013 to argue it was time college athletes get a paycheck.
Louis Moore, a history professor at Grand Valley State University, offered this observation even about the reintegration of sports in the first half of the last century. He pointed out how white Brooklyn Dodgers executive Branch Rickey was celebrated as much for seeking Jackie Robinson to break baseball's color barrier as Robinson, who endured the brunt of America's racism at the time, mostly by himself. Moore observed the same of Yale's white football players shortly after the Robinson experiment when they voted a black running back, Levi Jackson, as captain.
"The amount of 'help' whites provided black athletes is debatable," Moore wrote in his 2017 book, "We Will Win the Day: The Civil Rights Movement, the Black Athlete and the Quest for Equality," "but we do know that the stories we sometimes tell about integration, or the muscular assimilation of the black athlete, are overshadowed by the need to highlight white allies."
"Black folks have been saying that for decades, centuries," Dartmouth history professor Derrick White said on the Black Athlete podcast with Moore. "We're not getting equal treatment when it comes to any number of areas. But when white people say it, it becomes a larger story, in part because of their position and because of the privilege."
It's kind of like Kim Kardashian giving shine to President Trump on criminal justice reform as if countless black people such as Angela Davis and Marian Wright Edelman haven't been the vanguard of that effort for decades.
The role of white athletes in black athletes' struggles may be lost in our framing during the World Cup of what Rapinoe is daring to do, but she long understood her function.
"It was a little nod to Kaepernick and everything that he's standing for right now," Rapinoe told American Soccer Now in 2016, after she knelt during the national anthem before her NWSL team, the Seattle Reign, drew, 2-2, at Chicago. "I think it's actually pretty disgusting the way he was treated and the way that a lot of the media has covered it and made it about something that it absolutely isn't.
"We need to have a more thoughtful, two-sided conversation about racial issues in this country. It's important to have white people stand in support of people of color on this. We don't need to be the leading voice, of course, but standing in support of them is something that's really powerful."
So maybe that Rapinoe statue would be most representative if it wasn't just her - but her with Kaepernick, the man who inspired her in the first place.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – California Sen. Kamala Harris' rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination defended her after criticisms based on her race circulating on social media, which were amplified when Donald Trump Jr. shared one such post with his more 3.6 million followers on Thursday.
Trump Jr. retweeted a post from Ali Alexander – a conservative commentator whose Twitter profile claims to have "exposed Kamala Harris" – that said "Kamala Harris is *not* an American Black. She is half Indian and half Jamaican. I'm so sick of people robbing American Blacks (like myself) of our history. It's disgusting."
"Is this true? Wow," President Donald Trump's oldest son wrote, before deleting the post that same night, according to The New York Times.
"Don's tweet was simply him asking if it was true that Kamala Harris was half-Indian because it's not something he had ever heard before," Andy Surabian, a spokesman for Trump Jr. told the Times. "And once he saw that folks were misconstruing the intent of his tweet, he quickly deleted it."
Harris, 54, was born in Oakland, Calif. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan came to America from India where she met Donald Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica. Both civil rights activists, they met while pursuing graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Harris said in her memoir, "The Truths We Hold: An American Journey."
Many took note of Trump Jr.'s retweet, including those competing against Harris for the Democratic nomination. Harris' husband, Douglas Emhoff, thanked "the 2020 candidates and everyone else for calling out this crap for what it is."
"Donald Trump Jr. is a racist too. Shocker," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said on Twitter Saturday, along with a link to the Times story about Trump Jr.'s retweet.
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro called the attacks on Harris "disgusting" during an interview with CNN's "State of the Union" on Sunday and called Trump Jr. a "coward" for his tweet.
"He knows what he's doing," Castro said. "He's giving voice to these racist utterances about Senator Harris. We need to dispel them immediately and condemn them, and then not give them any more life, because they're disgusting."
"The attacks against @KamalaHarris are racist and ugly," said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, in a tweet. "We all have an obligation to speak out and say so. And it's within the power and obligation of tech companies to stop these vile lies dead in their tracks."
"This is racism. It was wrong before, and it's wrong now. We won't allow it again," Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said on Twitter.
"There's a long history of black Americans being told they don't belong – and millions are kept down and shut out to this day. @KamalaHarris is an American. Period. And all of us must call out attempts to question her identity for what they are: racist," former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock said the attacks on Harris "represent the worst of us."
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., put it more simply, tweeting that Harris "doesn't have s--- to prove."
Former Vice President Joe Biden compared the budding social media campaign about Harris' background to the "birtherism" conspiracy theory that questioned former President Barack Obama's citizenship and eligibility to serve as president.
Donald Trump, then a reality TV star, was a leading voice of birtherism during the Obama era.
"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It's disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America," Biden said in a tweet.
Biden and Harris had a feisty exchange on the issue of race and racism during the first Democratic debate of the 2020 campaign season.
Harris campaign spokeswoman Lily Adams weighed in on Donald Trump Jr.'s retweet.
"This is the same type of racist attacks his father used to attack Barack Obama. It didn't work then and it won't work now," Adams said in a statement.
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg also compared the attacks to birtherism.
"The presidential competitive field is stronger because Kamala Harris has been powerfully voicing her Black American experience. Her first-generation story embodies the American dream. It's long past time to end these racist, birther-style attacks," Buttigieg said in a tweet.
Similarly, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee called it a "coordinated smear campaign" and said the "Trump family is peddling birtherism again and it's incumbent on all of us to speak out against it."
"It is more than 'birtherism again' to question the race of @KamalaHarris. It's racism," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif.
Alexander said in a statement that it was Harris' claim to African-American identity during the debate that he was denouncing, and denied that he was trying to make any kind of "birtherism" argument, acknowledging that Harris was born in Oakland, California to parents "who were naturalized citizens."
"Me pointing out that Kamala Harris has a mother from India and a father from Jamaica went viral last night because many people assume she descends from Black American Slaves," he said. "She does not. I corrected Kamala Harris last night because she stole debate time under the premise that she is an African-American when she is in fact a biracial Indian-Jamaican who is a first generation American."
Some on social media said the viral spread of Alexander's post appeared to be aided by artificial accounts, commonly referred to as bots. Such accounts were central to the social media element of Russia's "sweeping and systematic" effort to interfere in the 2016 election, according to the special counsel Robert's Mueller's report.
One post by freelance journalist Caroline Orr was cited by several news publications.
"A lot of suspect accounts are pushing the 'Kamala Harris is not Black' narrative tonight. It's everywhere and it has all the signs of being a coordinated/artificial operation," Orr posted after the debate.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., indicated she believed bots played a role in disseminating Alexander's tweets.
"These troll-fueled racist attacks on Senator @KamalaHarris are unacceptable. We are better than this (Russia is not) and stand united against this type of vile behavior," Klobuchar tweeted.
Rep. Seth Mouton, D-Mass., said "these attacks are being promoted by the same kind of bot activity the Russians and others used to hijack our democracy in 2016. Don't fall for it."
But a Twitter spokesperson told The Hill, "Reports of malicious automation and 'bots' are false."
"We've see no coordinated activity around the debates, or this particular content. It is organic users sharing these views, much of which is not in violation of our policies."
Harris is not the only candidate whose identity as an African-American has been questioned by conservatives. After Wednesday night's debate, Fox News host Tucker Carlson referred to Booker, who is black, as one of "the two whitest candidates on stage" in a screed against Booker and O'Rouke's use of Spanish.

Texto completo: Dave Bartholomew, the producer, arranger, composer, trumpet player and bandleader who had a major hand in the shaping of New Orleans rhythm and blues and early rock 'n' roll, died Sunday in New Orleans. He was 100.
His death was confirmed by his son Ron.
An influential figure who worked mainly behind the scenes, Bartholomew was best known for the hits he produced for and wrote with Fats Domino, including "Ain't That a Shame" (originally released under the name "Ain't It a Shame") and "Blue Monday."
Under Bartholomew's direction, Domino placed 65 singles on the Billboard pop chart from 1955 to 1964. Among rock 'n' roll singers, only Elvis Presley had more during that period.
Bartholomew's musical reach extended well beyond his collaborations with Domino. He also produced and arranged signature hits by Lloyd Price ("Lawdy Miss Clawdy"), Shirley and Lee ("Let the Good Times Roll") and Smiley Lewis ("I Hear You Knocking").
"My Ding-a-Ling," Chuck Berry's only No.1 pop single, was an adaptation of "Little Girl Sing Ding-a-Ling," a recording Bartholomew made under his own name in 1952. Elton John, Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Hank Williams Jr. and Cheap Trick, among many others, have recorded material associated with Bartholomew.
"His importance cannot be overstated," Dr. Ira Padnos, a practicing anesthesiologist and the founder of the Ponderosa Stomp, a national touring revue and foundation that recognizes and promotes the work of American roots music pioneers, said in an interview for this obituary in 2010.
"Dave was one of rock 'n' roll's first great producers," Padnos said. "And he created what might have been the first rock 'n' roll record with 'The Fat Man,'" a hit for Domino in 1949. "There was nothing else like it at the time. He put a heavy back-beat behind an old blues tune, and it became rock 'n' roll."
That "big beat," as it came to be known, was supplied by drummer Earl Palmer, one of several unerringly funky musicians whom Bartholomew recruited to work in his band. (Others included saxophonists Lee Allen and Alvin (Red) Tyler.)
Besides appearing on his sessions, this tight ensemble played on Little Richard's volcanic mid-50s hits "Tutti Frutti" and "Long Tall Sally." It also backed Sam Cooke, with a young Allen Toussaint on piano, during his 1960 tour of the United States.
Fusing Mardi Gras parade rhythms, jump blues, big-band jazz and Tin Pan Alley pop, Bartholomew and his band created a Crescent City groove that became as enduring a part of rock 'n' roll vernacular as Bo Diddley's "shave-and-a-haircut" beat and Berry's "ringin' a bell" guitar.
No less remarkable was the fact that Bartholomew, a Black man, achieved such prominence working in the Jim Crow South. "He was operating in a very segregated environment," John Broven, author of "Rhythm & Blues in New Orleans," said in an interview. "You had to be somebody special to rise to the top."
Dave Bartholomew was born Dec. 24, 1918, in Edgard, Louisiana. (Some sources say the year was 1920, but the. family said 1918 is correct.) The son of a jazz trumpet player, he grew up in a musical home and learned to play the tuba before moving on to trumpet.
He earned the nickname Leather Lungs for his ability to hold a note, and by the time he was a teenager he had spent time in a number of the region's most popular bands, including those led by Joe Robicheaux and Papa Celestin. He later worked briefly with Jimmie Lunceford's big band, and with a military band while serving in the Army, where he began writing and arranging music.
After serving in World War II he formed his own group, which appeared in New Orleans night spots like the Club Tijuana and the Dew Drop Inn, before meeting the record mogul Lew Chudd, who signed Bartholomew to his label, Imperial.
Bartholomew was working for the label as a talent scout when he first heard Domino perform, at the Hideaway Club in New Orleans. "The Fat Man," the first single the two men made together, became a national hit and offered early proof of Bartholomew's astute mix of commercial and artistic instincts.
"He was smart enough to know you couldn't get a song named 'Junker Blues' played on the radio," Padnos explained, referring to the drug-themed song on which "The Fat Man" was based, "so he came up with 'The Fat Man' instead. With Fats he wrote stuff that was accessible enough that the kids would buy it."
The genial, steady-rolling arrangements Bartholomew wrote for Domino all but ensured the mainstream appeal of his music. The records Bartholomew released under his own name had more of a Caribbean or Afro-Cuban feel than his collaborations with Domino and the other youth-oriented performers whose sessions he produced. With titles like "Shrimp and Gumbo" and "Carnival Day," these recordings were evocative of local New Orleans culture.
A broad cross section of Bartholomew's music, including his work with renowned blues musicians like T-Bone Walker and Roy Brown, was presented in "The Spirit of New Orleans: The Genius of Dave Bartholomew," a two-CD set released by Capitol Records in 1993.
Bartholomew's name was linked to steadily fewer hit records as the 1960s gave way to the '70s, but he remained active into his 80s. His 1998 studio album, "New Orleans Big Beat" (Landslide), featured "Jazz Fest in New Orleans," which became the unofficial anthem of the city's annual Jazz and Heritage Festival.
He was given a Trustees Award, for lifetime achievement, by the Recording Academy in 2014.
Survivors include his wife, Rhea (Douse) Bartholomew; his daughters, Diane Wilson and Jacqueline Temple; his sons, Dave Jr., Don and Ron; three stepchildren, Alvin LaBeaud, Darrell LaBeaud and Deborah Hubbard; a sister, Thelma Cooper; 25 grandchildren; and many great-grandchildren.
Bartholomew's compositions have been included or the soundtracks of music themed movies like "The Girl Can't Help It" (1956) and "American Graffiti" (1973) A member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he was elected to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991.
That he was inductedin the "nonperformer" category was appropriate but perhaps misleading, Broken said. In addition to being "the one who organized all the musicians and whipped everyone into shape in the studio," he noted, "he was a great musician himself, a red-hot trumpeter."

Entertainment companies sell fiction, but truth matters, too

Texto completo: Earlier this month, Jody Rosen's blockbuster New York Times Magazine story "The Day the Music Burned revealed not only that huge numbers of important recordings had been destroyed in a 2008 conflagration, but that we hadn't known the extent of the loss for more than a decade.
In the weeks since, many artists have faced the dismaying reality of what happened to the original recordings of their work and the extent of their losses. It's a horrible story about the indifference the companies who own significant parts of our cultural heritage show toward these priceless artifacts. And it's an illustration of just how hard it is for journalists and the public to get the truth out of entertainment companies - and why that matters.
As Erik Wemple noted in The Washington Post after Rosen's story was initially published, one of the most alarming revelations in Rosen's article was that back in 2008, a spokesperson for the Universal Music Group was able to convince the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and Billboard magazine that the losses in the fire were insignificant.
The business side of showbiz has never been an easy beat to cover because the people who run movie studios, TV networks, publishing houses and record labels tend to be good at hype. They also have the money and the leverage to make it hard on journalists to pursue unflattering stories.
In the past, though, the press and the public could rely on certain checks. We knew generally what movies cost to make and what they made at the box office. We could pull up the Nielsen ratings for a TV show, see where an album landed on the Billboard charts and read the New York Times bestseller list to know how a book was doing.
Those checks still exist, but they're increasingly inadequate. When the mass media's digital revolution hit, the numbers that define "success and "failure changed. It's no longer enough to compare what a movie or album costs to make vs. how many tickets or copies it sells because "sales are only one tributary feeding into the larger revenue flow.
Netflix, for example, doesn't sell its original films and TV series as individual units; Netflix sells subscriptions. The company's bean counters look at complex - and proprietary - matrices of numbers to determine whether one of their shows is a hit.
Meanwhile, the amount of independently verified data made available to the public has been curtailed over the past decade. Streaming services such as Netflix don't turn over their viewership numbers to auditors such as Nielsen. If Netflix flacks say more subscribers watched one of their original movies in its first weekend than attended the top movie at the box office, we can't really prove them wrong.
The music industry relies more and more on sites such as Spotify and YouTube to disseminate its product, and it's not always obvious how - or if - those clicks translate into dollars. And even when we have some idea of how much money record labels and subscription services are earning in the digital realm, we don't always know how much they're spending to make their products available to stream or download.
Compounding the problem for journalists is that the technology that contains and distributes media is getting harder for a layperson to understand. When a catastrophe such as the Universal fire happens, a spokesperson can offer reassurances about master recordings being backed up off-site on hard drives and digital tapes.
But as anyone who's had to buy multiple cellphones and laptops over the past decade knows, even state-of-the-art tech can decay, malfunction or become incompatible with today's hardware. How do we know that something similar is not happening here?
Without good numbers, and without a good understanding of the technology involved, journalists who write about entertainment - or even just those who care deeply about its past, present and future - often have to trust corporations to be open and transparent with us. But the corporations have very little incentive to do so.
Consumers have been punished for this general policy of obfuscation regularly. How many times have music buffs been told that an album they bought digitally would be available in perpetuity on all platforms, only to see it disappear overnight after a software update?
How many lengthy user agreements have we reflexively clicked "I approve on, unaware that we were giving away our privacy rights?
And, at a moment when organized fans can sometimes give new life to a television show in danger of cancellation or demonstrate that there is a market for pop culture that hasn't previously been widely accessible, the lack of transparency about the entertainment business makes it harder for consumers to advocate for their own interests and those of the artists they love.
The big picture is even more dire. If we've learned anything from the Universal fire story, it's that we can't really trust that the people in charge of our cultural legacy won't drain it of its current value and then let the leftovers burn - without us ever knowing exactly what we've lost. And that the old saying, "Trust, but verify, is poor advice when the latter's impossible.

Texto completo: "Parental leave is taken after a very senior, high-profile male has taken it and it's been perceived they took it without consequence." Jaime Klein founder of Inspire Human Resources in New York
When Nashville data engineer Taylor Murphy and his wife welcomed their now 1-year-old son, Owen, last year, Murphy was offered 12 weeks of paid leave from his Silicon Valley employer GitLab. He took less than two.
Among his reasons: He was six months into his job, he had recently received a promotion, he had just hired two new employees, and he wanted to be available as they started.
When he told his new hires about taking a short leave, he advised them to do it differently — if or when they become parents.
"I said, 'Look, I know I am setting a bad example. I would encourage you to take more time,' " Murphy said. "If we have another child, I do plan on taking more time."
Paid parental leave for fathers is increasing nationally, with 29% of employers offering paid paternity leave in 2018, up from 12% in 2014. But many new fathers are reticent to take advantage of their employers' more generous policies, according to 2017 and 2018 SHRM Employee Benefits reports. Just more than one-third of male employees took all of their paid leave, half the rate of female employees; 40% of male employees used less than half of their available paid leave.
"There is pressure for men not to take paternity leave, even if a company has it written down in policy," said Elizabeth Gedmark of A Better Balance advocacy organization in Nashville. "If it's not something that upper management is encouraging, or if a man perceives that he is going to have any kind of career sacrifices, then often he won't take advantage of it."
For some men, they feel there is a stigma attached to taking a leave, evidenced by a stray comment made by a manager, Gedmark said. Or, if they don't see other men or secondary caregivers, especially managers, taking time off, they may be more reticent to take time away. Sometimes, it is a matter of timing — if they are in the middle of a big project, they might feel like taking time off is not feasible.
"Parental leave is taken after a very senior, high-profile male has taken it and it's been perceived they took it without consequence," said Jaime Klein, founder of Inspire Human Resources in New York. "The first male who is senior that either adopts or has a child has to take the leave. Once they do, the junior males will feel it is not as scary."
'We want you to have this time with your child and your spouse' Access to help from fathers after a child's birth boosted mothers' postpartum health, according to a recent study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, reported on by The New York Times. An Institute for Women's Policy Research 2014 report found leave for fathers can lead to greater involvement with raising children beyond the leave period. It can also lead to greater gender equity at work by alleviating any penalties for women taking time off after a child's birth.
"When men start taking the leave, too, the stigma of taking that leave is removed for everyone, including women," said Christy Tosh Crider, who leads Baker Donelson's health care litigation group in the law firm's Nashville office.
Crider pushed to expand the law firm's parental leave policy in 2015 by adding three weeks of paid leave for secondary caregivers and by expanding paid leave to 16 weeks from 12 weeks for primary caregivers. The firm also added flexibility on when parents can choose to take their leave, allowing them to break it up instead of taking it all at once. Baker Donelson attorneys, primary and non-primary caregivers, are taking advantage, she said.
To make the new policy successful, the firm trained parental leave advisers — men and women — in each of the firm's offices to encourage use of and explain the policy to expectant parents. Crider also offered several sessions on the policy to practice group chairs and managing shareholders, educating them on the importance of encouraging the policy and showing them how client services would not be interrupted.
"Our leaders became big proponents of the policy," Crider said. "Some of them would pick up the phone for a non-primary caregiver who they knew had a spouse expecting and say, 'I expect you to take this leave. We offer it because we want you to have this time with your child and your spouse.' "
The policy change was business driven, as Crider explained to partners wondering how it would affect the firm financially and impact clients. Better policies would lead to greater loyalty and retention, which would improve client services. Lower turnover reduces costs. Offering and encouraging paid leave for secondary caregivers would also help achieve Baker Donelson's goal of making the firm a place where everyone who is motivated can succeed.
Crider said the flexibility aspect has been key to participation. If secondary caregivers choose to work some during the first three weeks of their child's life, they can use that time later — to take a child to a doctor's visit or stay home as their spouse transitions back to work.
Long-term benefits Similarly, Eventbrite offers flexibility on when new parents, both primary and secondary caregivers, access its 18-week paid leave policy. Company-wide, secondary caregivers have used between two and 18 weeks of leave. In Nashville, they have been more likely to use most of the time, but they tend to break it up — either into monthlong stretches or they have chosen to take off one day a week, said Erin Tomlinson, general manager of Eventbrite's Nashville office. Those who have adopted have used the time to travel to go get their children.
"People are very open to the benefit," Tomlinson said. "In the end, when you support your employees and they feel like they truly can have a work-life balance, they will be more productive and more happy and you will have less attrition. The immediate cost might seem high, but you have to look out across the long term."
Jerel Robinson, an Eventbrite senior manager of international sales in Nashville, said he was at first skeptical he would need so much time off, but he decided to embrace the opportunity after speaking with company leaders. He took a month off work when his son, Kyler, was born in October. He woke with him in the night, changed diapers, prepped bottles and picked out dad-themed onesies. He took another month off when he and his wife began training their son to sleep through the night and touring day cares, and he expects to take the remaining weeks in the next few months.
"My dad has been very involved with my life every step of the way. I want to be the same type of dad for my son," Robinson said. "If I wasn't there to take the time off and be there with my family and my wife, I would have missed so much."
A critical time for bonding Jacob Brown, a human resources business partner at Mars Petcare in Franklin, described his six weeks of paid leave as critical to bonding with his now 2-year-old son. He had been apprehensive about becoming a father and described his early efforts as "robotic" or "clinical," more following the correct steps of care. It wasn't until the fourth or fifth week that he felt like he experienced the joys of fatherhood and appreciated the closeness he felt with this new presence in his life.
"There was this weird shift, intrinsically, where I was able to connect with him, find some joy and happiness," he said. "In week six, it was a full 180 from where I was before the birth. Without that time at home to support each other and get to know the child and connect differently, I don't know how long it would have taken me to get there."
Brown said he felt only encouragement from the top down, from women and men, to take the whole leave, and seeing others take full advantage influenced his own decision, he said.
For Mars, the benefits outweigh any business costs associated with six weeks of leave.
"We believe strongly that engaged associates, associates who have the opportunity to have a balance and flexibility within work and life, tend to be associates who are happier," said Dave Bradey, Mars' vice president of people and organizations. "They give more."

Texto completo: Fox News host Tucker Carlson sparked controversy on Sunday while defending President Donald Trump's decision to engage with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, despite international condemnation of Kim as an authoritarian who is guilty of systematic human rights abuses.
During an interview on Fox News, Carlson was asked about potential concerns among voters that Trump might be seen as "pandering" to Kim with his often flattering quotes about the North Korean leader and the "chemistry" that Trump says they share.
Carlson said there "is no defending the North Korean regime," which he described as "monstrous and "the last really Stanilist regime in the world. "
"On the other hand, you've got to be honest about what it means to lead a country. It means killing people," Carlson continued. "Not on the scale the North Koreans do, but a lot of countries commit atrocities, including a number that we are closely allied with. "
Limos, vodka and nukes: How a sanctions' sleuth traces North Korea's illicit transactions
Carlson said that while he "is not a relativist or anything" it is the "nature and life, and certainly the nature of power" to have to choose between "the bad people and the worse people. "
"I do think that's how the president sees it," Carlson said. "He's far less sentimental about this stuff. "
The star of "Tucker Carlson Tonight" said he believed Trump genuinely likes Kim and sees him as a "competent, scrappy guy," though "he's not an admirer of the atrocities he's committed, obviously. "
"It takes a pretty hard man to keep a hold on power in a place like North Korea, so I think Trump respects his toughness"
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is one of two dozen Democrats seeking the 2020 presidential nomination, criticized Trump's praise of Kim Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation. "
"He goes and gets a letter and says, 'I love the guy,' you know, right in the face of the Warmbier's, who lost their son, Otto," she said, referring to a college student who fas fatally injured while in North Korean custody. "So I am concerned just because of the track record here. "
"Talk is good," she said talk alone "doesn't produce anything for national security for America and international security for our allies. "
Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, another Democratic presidential candidate, said Sunday on ABC's "This Week" that Trump is "raising the profile" and "growing the strength of a dictator," while "we haven't gotten anything out of it. "
Carlson mocked those – like former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power – who advocate for making humans rights concerns a central focus of U. S. foreign policy considerations as "silly and stupid. "
"In the end, what matters is what's good for the United States," he said.
Carlson comments were swiftly condemned by many on social media.
"Someone should ask Tucker Carlson whether part of running a nation is forced abortions by the state," tweeted Courthouse News reporter Adam Klasfeld. Klasfeld also posted a tweet linking to a U. N. report on North Korea's methods of forced abortions.
"Tucker Carlson is a keynote speaker at the forthcoming National Conservatism Conference," tweeted Bill Kristol, a conservative critic of Trump. "I don't know they realized they were signing up to be associated with this. "
Tom Nichols, another conservative opposed to Trump, slammed the remarks as evidence that Carlson "has enough money and what he really wants is attention for however much longer his aging, insane demo is going to be alive and watching him. "
Carlson's influence with the president appears to be on the rise. He was seen alongside Trump administration officials during Trump's visit to the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea. And The New York Times reported last week that Carlson helped influence the president in his decision to order military strikes against Iranian targets after the Islamic Republic allegedly shot down an unmanned U. S. drone.
Many noted that national security adviser John Bolton, a hawk who has advocated for military action against Iran, was absent from the trip to the DMZ. Carlson has called Bolton "demented" for his ongoing belief that President George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq was a good thing and called him "a kind of bureaucratic tapeworm. "
"Try as you might, you can’t expel him. He seems to live forever in the bowels of the federal agencies, periodically reemerging to cause pain and suffering – but critically somehow never suffering himself," Carlson said of Bolton.
Carlson is slated to sit down with Trump on Sunday for an interview to air on Fox News on Monday, the Daily Beast reported.

Secrets to long, healthy life in Okinawa provide lessons for business leaders

Texto completo: The Japanese island of Okinawa boasts the highest life expectancy, and the greatest concentration of centenarians (people who live to 100), in the world.
Their culture, rituals, diet and environment have been the subject of extensive study as researches try to crack the code of longer, healthier life.
When questioned why their people are vastly healthier and outlive others around the world, Okinawan residents often credit two words for their vitality and longevity: ikigai and moai.
Ikiagi is essentially one's driving force or purpose of life. It is the through line that connects people's actions to their calling; their reason for living.
Moai refers to one's tribe. The inner circle of friends, family and colleagues that enrich life's experiences. A strong moai provides uplifting support and counsel during the tough times while cheering you on during life's triumphs.
As business leaders, what can we learn from these key Okinawan themes? Ironically, the principles of ikigai and moai are the same elements that determine longevity and vitality in our organizations. They are the fuel that drives sustainable success.
How the words apply to your business Your business' ikigai — or sense of purpose — is what ignites passion, creativity and resilience in your team. Without a strong why, work is merely transactional. As a leader, developing and reinforcing an important ikigai provides a compelling North Star for daily actions and important decisions. The stronger your ikigai, the more your people will push themselves, and in turn your organization, to greatness.
As the war for talent rages on, a highly developed moai may be your best approach to attracting, retaining, and engaging the best of the best. In the same way playing tennis with someone better than you improves your own game, a tight knit culture of mutual respect will boost collective performance. The most effective organizations cultivate their moai to encourage courage, nurture personal growth, and drive collaborative innovation. The best bands, dance troupes, and sports teams craft a deliberate culture in which the supportive nature of the team elevates all participants.
Taking care of human needs As human beings, we crave well-being, vitality and longevity. As leaders, we want the exact same things for our organizations.
So let's follow the lead of those individuals that consistently outperform their peers around the globe. Let's embrace the ancient Okinawan principles of ikigai and moai in order to maximize the health of our companies, careers, and communities.
Here's to your 100 years of success.

Texto completo: For several months, the American Civil Liberties Union has sent me mailers on a litany of issues, including inhuman policies by the Justice Department and President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. But they're all really about abortion rights.
The ACLU seeks contributions that in part go to pay for its legal battles to keep abortion legal. So, instead, I sent the folks at the ACLU a one-sentence letter: "I don't kill babies."
White House hopeful Joe Biden long supported the so-called Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funding to pay for abortions. He has now backed off that position, saying he changed his stance because a health care proposal he's working on for his presidential bid relies on expanding access to federally funding health insurance. If the Hyde Amendment is in place, people wouldn't have access to abortion coverage through his proposal, which has yet to be released.
Biden's position disturbs me. Presidents need courage, and America needs a president with courage.
And I'm afraid the Catholic Church is so deeply distracted by the sexual-abuse crisis that it is failing to protect the unborn.
It would help if the church put aside its opposition to contraceptives. Most theologians would agree that anyone engaging in sexual relationships should use contraceptives.
That brings me to the June 13 New York Times opinion piece by Rep. Pramila Jayapal. A Democrat from Washington, she explained why she decided to have an abortion and what it taught her about reproductive choice.
Her first child, whom she called "a miracle," was born unexpectedly in India at 26.5 weeks, shortly before she and her husband were to return to the United States. The baby weighed only 1 pound, 14 ounces at birth. However, despite the baby's weaknesses and illnesses, the child survived and recently graduated from college. But Jayapal developed postpartum depression, which lasted for years, and later divorced her husband.
Years later, she remarried. She wanted to have more children, but she writes that doctors advised her "that any future pregnancy would be extremely high-risk and could result" in a birth similar to her first child. She and her husband took precautions against getting pregnant, but she, in fact, got pregnant.
What to do? She considered her options, before deciding that she "could not responsibly have the baby." She had an abortion.
Her main point, of course, is that every woman should be allowed to choose.
But after reading Jayapal's op-ed, I went through the morning angry at her for killing a child and also at the Times for giving her all that op-ed space. I thought there was little consideration for human values or religious beliefs.
Then I went to community mass, and simply prayed that she be forgiven.

Texto completo: Legendary multi-billionaire businessman Eli Broad wrote a heartfelt New York Times opinion column this month urging a broad wealth tax to improve income inequality. Worthy goal. The column's subhead says, “Wealthy people like me should commit to reducing the ravages of economic inequality. ” Most wealth lists say I’m only worth about half what Broad is, but I have an idea for him that is twice as good, faster and more direct than any wealth tax.
We all want people to do better — or should. Helping is surely good; but how to do it best? Broad specifically wants a $15 an hour minimum wage, education reform, expanded medical care access and more affordable housing. Two decades ago, he embraced full-time philanthropy to work towards many of those ends. How is that working for you, Broad?
Well now, finally, he recognizes, “no amount of philanthropic commitment will compensate for the deep inequities preventing most Americans — the factory workers and farmers, entrepreneurs and electricians, teachers, nurses and small-business owners — from the basic prosperity we call the American dream. ” So now he wants us both taxed higher via a wealth tax.
You've got money to spare — spend it
Here’s what you should do. Quit all that feel good philanthropy. Forget the taxes. Presumably you have some liquidity or you couldn’t pay extra in taxes or offer philanthropy. Then take that liquidity, all of it, however much of your $6. 7 billion net worth, and go hire as many of those people you want to help as you can. Focus them on doing something people want and will pay for.
Some call that entrepreneurship. I call it a no-brainer. You can call it capitalism, or whatever. Regardless, you put them immediately into doing good for others (or if others don’t think it’s good, they won’t buy your product). You immediately reduce income inequality for those hired (they made less or nothing before, by definition, or they won’t come to work for you). You create your own training programs.
Drain the Financial District: What Democrats must tell Trump: Get infrastructure money from corporations and the rich
You say you can’t figure out what they should do? Well, if a successful businessman like Eli Broad can’t figure how to put people to work to do good, at great incomes, reducing income inequality immediately, how in high holy heck is rocket scientist Uncle Sam gonna do it with neo-revised visions of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society-type programs-to-nowhere? You can do it fast, right now and help solve this problem relative to your wealth’s fair share compared to others.
It is what I am doing.
I, once broke, started a taxable for-profit business in 1979 that I’ve built since 1993 as a veritable taxable non-profit. My firm’s profits get plowed back in routinely, growing jobs, paying people more, reducing more income inequality by putting more people to work. That’s how I got half as rich as you. I’m still at it. No profit; no tax. It’s satisfying when I hear families’ stories.
I think you would be better at this than me. You are business savvy. Consider it this way. Only one of two things can happen. You either succeed, or you fail. It works either way.
Entrepreneurship is a win-win-win
If you succeed you did your full share to reduce income inequality. You made customers happy or they wouldn’t buy your product. Your employees paid their fair share of income tax so Uncle Sam isn’t mad. And, you actually got wealthier so you can do even more of it next year, helping even more people.
If your business fails, you still paid the people you hired. If you think about it, that is almost perfectly equal to a transfer payment — which is certainly what happens when Uncle Sam taxes you. Look at the make-up of federal spending since you’ve done philanthropy; it’s mostly transfer payments anyway. So, your failed enterprise is basically equal to if you were taxed that much. Yet those you hired had jobs, learned new skills, added to their resume — while seeking their next step up.
We wealthy should help. But smart business folks like you should do it faster and better by directly putting people into what Bill Clinton called "high-paying jobs. " Go higher. It’s the economy, stupid. Always was. Fifteen bucks an hour is no destination. You can create your own great destinations without any tax.

SYDNEY, Australia -- Human rights groups call them a violation of international law. The Australian government says they are crucial to regulating the flow of immigration.
But one thing is indisputable about Australia's offshore detention centers on the islands of Manus and Nauru: Despair is soaring among asylum seekers being held there.
Since Australia's national election on May 18, which returned to power a conservative government that has maintained hard-line policies intended to deter asylum seekers, there have been dozens of suicide attempts and acts of self-harm at the refugee centers.
"It's hard to know how many cases are serious cases of people trying to end their lives or a cry for help, but in any case it's a big escalation," said Elaine Pearson, the Australia director for Human Rights Watch, who has made several visits to Manus. "People are very worried they are going to be completely forgotten about."
The Australian government argues that its strict border protection policy, which bars settlement for migrants who try to reach the country by sea, has worked: Fewer boats with asylum seekers on board are trying to reach Australia compared to a decade ago.
Australia's immigration policies received a forceful endorsement on Thursday morning from President Trump, who was scheduled to have dinner that evening with Prime Minister Scott Morrison in Osaka, Japan.
But many of the detainees on Manus and Nauru, cognizant of Australian polls that showed the opposition Labor Party leading before the May election, had hoped a change in immigration policy was on the horizon. When Labor lost, desperation intensified.
Adding to the despair, the United States has rejected resettlement applications for roughly 300 refugees on the two islands, despite a deal reached by the Obama administration to take in more than 1,000 of them.
The situation has grown especially dark on Manus, a remote island in Papua New Guinea where several hundred men from Afghanistan, Iran and other countries are being held.
It was grim when I visited nearly two years ago to write about the situation. Now, it's worse. Every few days, it seems, a new instance emerges of people cutting themselves, setting themselves on fire or trying to harm themselves in some other way.
To better understand the problem, The New York Times worked with human rights groups and asylum seekers on Manus to compile a rough timeline of events since the May 18 election.
This is not a comprehensive list, but rather a selection of significant moments -- including official responses from Papua New Guinea and Australia -- that are adding pressure to an already intense debate.
May 20
Within 48 hours of the election that returned Mr. Scott Morrison to power, the details of six suicide attempts start to emerge.
Four of the men, including a Sudanese man who left a suicide note, ended up in the hospital. The two others were held by the police after they tried to set fire to themselves in their rooms.
"We are really devastated with the election results," Shamindan Kanapathi, 28, a Sri Lankan refugee on Manus, wrote in a text message to refugee advocates at the time. "We are really disappointed."
May 29
The main hospital on Manus, an under-equipped one-story clinic, begins to turn away those arriving with injuries from self-harm.
Suicide attempts also start to emerge in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea, where some asylum seekers have been moved.
The Refugee Action Coalition, an advocacy group, reports that one Iraqi asylum seeker tried to hang himself and was saved when he was cut down by a guard.
In several other cases, the coalition said, refugees swallowed razor blades and needles.
There are 490 asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea. To try to keep them safe, the police step up patrols near their housing.
June 3
Mr. Kanapathi, whose resettlement application was rejected by the United States last year, sends a series of text messages just before midnight:
"Just short while ago an Iranian cut his hand bit deeper and lost too much blood."
"Also one Sudanese man harmed himself tonight."
June 8
Abdul Aziz Muhamat, 25, a refugee from Sudan who has spent six years on Manus, announces on Twitter that Switzerland has granted him asylum.
June 10
Another text from Mr. Kanapathi: "Bloody hell just few minutes ago a highly depressed man set himself in fire. I think it's very serious situation."
June 13
As the suicide attempts continue, the governor of Manus Province, Charlie Benjamin, calls for Australia to finally accept the men they have sent to Manus.
"They don't want to be here, and Australia, you have to take responsibility," he says. "You have to move them."
June 16
Peter Dutton, Australia's home affairs minister, who oversees border protection and detention, says the government is looking at repealing the so-called Medevac law, passed this year, which makes it easier for refugees and asylum seekers on Manus and Nauru to seek medical treatment in Australia.
He says the law could allow criminals to reach Australia. He adds that 531 people from Manus and Nauru have already been settled in the United States, and that a few hundred more are "still in the pipeline."
"I want to reduce the number down to zero on both islands," he says. "But I don't want to bring people here who pose a risk."
June 20
Mr. Dutton warns that a court decision upholding the Medevac law could lead to a surge of boat arrivals. He pledges to keeping pushing for repeal.
Later that afternoon, a man near the main transit center in Manus climbs to the top of an internet tower and threatens to jump. A few hours later, he climbs back down.
June 21
A 31-year-old asylum seeker from India lights himself and his room on fire. Refugees on Manus report that he had sought care at a hospital but did not receive it, leading him to harm himself.
"While the home affairs minister spends his time arguing to repeal the Medevac bill, the situation on Manus spins out of control," says Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition.
June 24
An asylum seeker on Manus posts images of an X-ray showing a man who swallowed a nail clipper.
June 25
Papua New Guinea's new prime minister, James Marape, demands local control of the lucrative contract to run the refugee centers on Manus.
The Australian Financial Review, a business newspaper, had revealed that a little-known security firm, Paladin, was given a contract worth 20.9 million Australian dollars ( $ 14.6 million) a month without a competitive tender. In January, one of the firm's local directors was arrested on charges of fraud and money laundering.
June 26
The governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea agree to extend the Paladin contract.
When a handful of the asylum seekers on Manus count up all the incidents of self-harm and attempted suicide since the election, they tell me the figure approaches 100 -- with many examples kept hidden because people don't want to shame their families.
"No matter what company takes the contract -- a local company or foreign company -- our situation is the same," Mr. Kanapathi said. "Both the Australian and P.N.G. governments are playing with our lives. To them, we are nothing other than commodities that are used to benefit their political careers whilst we are on the ground fighting for our lives."

Texto completo: When Sunday's New York Times Cooking newsletter rolled into readers' inboxes Sunday morning, a photo of a familiar kind of cubed meat jumped out.
That's right.
The Times' urged its readers to cook up speidies over the weekend.
"Two days into the season, and it's past time to open up the summer house of the mind, commence the annual rereading of Colson Whitehead's 'Sag Harbor,' get ready to hit the grill in shorts and flip-flops on the final day of the weekend, make some spiedies (above) even though you didn't think to start marinating them last night," NYT Food Editor Sam Sifton wrote in the newsletter.
Sifton's spiedie recipe can be found in the cooking section of the New York Times' website. It cites Binghamton and defines spiedies as "meat marinated for a long time in what amounts to Italian dressing, then threaded onto skewers, grilled, and slid into a cheap sub roll, sometimes with a drizzle of fresh marinade or hot sauce."
In the newsletter, Sifton suggested to marinade pork or chicken spiedies in an "acid bath of vinegar, lemon juice, oil and herbs."
"And after you've cooked the meat, you can slide it in pieces into a hero roll brushed with garlic butter and dotted with hot sauce and experience a version of nirvana," Sifton wrote.
On the side, Sifton suggested a recipe for Grilled Broccoli With Apricot Puttanesca and a Simple Strawberry Tart for dessert.
It might be a little fanicer than we're used to, but we can't wait to give it a try.

More eyes on heart units

Texto completo: Childrens heart surgery departments across Florida will soon be subject to more oversight.

Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill late Tuesday that will let physician experts visit struggling programs and make recommendations for improvement.

Lawmakers proposed the measure after the Tampa Bay Times reported the mortality rate for pediatric heart surgery patients at Johns Hopkins All Childrens Hospital in St. Petersburg reached nearly 10 percent in 2017. The rate was the highest any Florida hospital had seen in a decade.

The Times also found that hospital leaders had disregarded medical staff members concerns about surgical problems as early as 2015.

All Childrens stopped performing heart surgeries late last year. Six top officials resigned shortly after the Times report was published.

Now we will have the oversight that is necessary to make sure we have the best programs here in Florida, said Sen. Gayle Harrell, a Stuart Republican who championed the bill.

It will be a major change in how we do things, she added.

The problems in All Childrens Heart Institute had been whispered about in heart surgery circles for months before surgeries were stopped.

Last August  after the Times had reported the program was struggling but before it revealed the increased mortality rate  the president of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a letter to the state health care regulator, suggesting that a panel of doctors review the hospitals surgeries. The agencys head declined, saying the law didnt allow it.

At the time, only state inspectors could make site visits. But the Times reported that they missed the heart programs problems last year, even after promising a thorough investigation.

The bill signed into law Tuesday makes significant changes.

It lets a committee called the Pediatric Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel appoint physician experts to visit Floridas 10 childrens heart surgery programs. They will be able to examine surgical results, review death reports, inspect the facilities and interview employees.

Dr. David Nykanen, the chairman of the advisory panel and a pediatric cardiologist at Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children in Orlando, called site visits crucially important, especially when departments are having problems.

He said visits could start within the next six months.

The childrens heart surgery measure passed as part of a larger proposal on health care (HB 843). The original bill on the subject was gutted in the House in late March.

Rep. Mike Beltran, the Lithia Republican who pushed the idea in the House, said he had worked hard to keep it alive. I am very pleased that we were able to address the problems at All Childrens Hospital by enhancing the Pediatric Cardiac Technical Advisory Panel, he said.

DeSantis office did not respond to requests for comment.

Many hospitals have struggled with pediatric heart surgery, a complicated specialty area that can be very lucrative.

In 2015, St. Marys Medical Center in West Palm Beach closed its program amid media reports of a high mortality rate. Earlier this month, North Carolina Childrens Hospital said it would stop performing complex heart procedures. The announcement came after a New York Times investigation revealed that doctors had raised concerns about an increase in deaths.

For All Childrens, the fallout is ongoing.

A recent financial report showed that operating profit for the entire Johns Hopkins Health System fell $31.7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter last year.

System leaders attributed the 70 percent decline mainly to problems in All Childrens Heart Institute.

The hospital has not yet resumed heart surgeries. The results of a review commissioned by the Johns Hopkins Medicine board are expected soon.

Trump accuses Silicon Valley of rigging 2020 election against him

Texto completo: To President Trump, the size of his Twitter fan base is evidence that Silicon Valley is trying to rig the 2020 election against Republicans.
While the real estate mogul-turned-politician's personal following of more than 61 million users is the 12th-highest worldwide, it would be bigger still if the San Francisco-based social media platform weren't inhibiting his performance, he told Fox Business personality Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday.
"I have millions and millions of followers, but I will tell you they make it very hard for people to join me on Twitter; they make it very much harder for me to get out the message," Trump said. "If I announced tomorrow that I was going to become a nice liberal Democrat, I would pick up five times more followers."
iFrame Object
Twitter has repeatedly denied such accusations, noting that workers attempt to keep the platform healthy by removing fake accounts employed to manipulate or harass users. That sometimes leads to smaller follower counts for prominent posters, the company has said, but boosts user confidence.
The president's comments marked the latest round in the conflict between Republicans and Silicon Valley, whose biggest firms have consistently rejected claims of bias against conservatives that were raised when they began flagging and removing phony accounts after the 2016 election. Some had been created by Russian operatives to sway voters in Trump's favor, U.S. intelligence agencies said, and others were designed merely to fuel partisan conflict.
"They talk about Russia because they had some bloggers," the president said during his telephone interview with Bartiromo. "By the way, those bloggers, some of them were going both ways — they were for Clinton and for Trump."
The more pressing concern is that Silicon Valley firms are "trying to rig the election," the president said. "That's what we should be focused on, not the phony witch hunt," he added, referring to an investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Mueller's report, which was released in April and cited numerous contacts between campaign officials and Russians, said there wasn't sufficient evidence to support conspiracy charges. The special counsel declined, however, to absolve Trump of obstruction of justice, citing testimony that he attempted to steer as well as to end the investigation.
Trump, who has dismissed coverage of the investigation that he disliked as fake news, has garnered support from congressional allies in his claims of Silicon Valley bias over the past few years. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, introduced a bill this month that would strip tech platforms of immunity for content posted by users unless they prove they're "politically neutral."
And in a Tuesday hearing called by the Senate subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the Internet, Sen. Ted Cruz — a Texas Republican who fought Trump for the 2016 presidential nomination — cited documents and video from Project Veritas that Google executives were working together to prevent another "Trump situation."
Project Veritas, a conservative group that uses covert information-gathering techniques, has been accused of selectively editing and misrepresenting its findings. Its founder, James O'Keefe, pleaded guilty in 2010 to entering the office of then-U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, under false pretenses.
"These documents raise very serious questions about political bias at the company," Cruz said.
Trump himself has suggested responding by regulating Google and other tech companies with new laws as well as suing them.
"Twitter is just terrible, what they do. I've had so many people come to me, 'Sir, I can't join you on Twitter.' I see what's happening 100%," he said Wednesday. "It's amazing that I won the election."
The president, however, doesn't have to depend on a Congress deadlocked between House Democrats and Senate Republicans to improve his following, branding consultants have told the Washington Examiner.
He might win more followers simply by indulging in fewer tweetstorms, which can quickly suck up all the space on a smartphone screen, following more of the people who follow him, and adopting a less divisive tone.
"One key thing that stands out right away is the follow-back ratio," said Dave Kerpen, the chairman of consultant Likeable Media and the author of Likeable Social Media: How to Delight Your Customers, Create an Irresistible Brand, and Be Generally Amazing on Facebook (And Other Social Networks), a New York Times bestseller.
While Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, has more followers (reportedly the source of some of Trump's angst), the former president himself follows 613,000 people.
Trump follows only 45, which is the "equivalent of people putting their hand out to take your hand and you rejecting them," Kerpen said. "He’s essentially telling people that they’re not good enough, smart enough, or interesting enough for him to bother following them back."
Obama has the world's second-largest Twitter following, 106 million, surpassed only by singer Katy Perry, who has 107 million followers.
As for the president, his tweets have consistently garnered print, radio, and television news coverage. His Twitter posts on Iran, for instance, made the front page of the Wall Street Journal.

Texto completo: Are they people or symbols? And if they're both — which they are — what do we owe to each?
You've seen the photograph by now, and if it doesn't break your heart you might want to ask yourself why. An overhead shot, taken from the top of a bank overlooking the Rio Grande, at two corpses face down in the water.
They are the bodies of Óscar Alberto Martínez Ramírez and his 23-month-old daughter, Valeria. They, along with Valeria's mother, Tania Vanessa Ávalos, were Salvadoran immigrants seeking asylum in the United States. Unable to cross the international bridge, they decided to test the waters separating Matamoros, Mexico, from Brownsville, Texas.
Reports of what happened have varied: According to The New York Times, Valeria was being ferried on her father's back when they were carried away by the waters near the US shore. Ávalos had swum back to shore and watched them drown. According to other media accounts, the father and daughter initially crossed safely, but when he returned to help Ávalos, the frightened girl jumped back into the water after him, and as he tried to rescue her, the two were swept away together.
The photograph was taken by Mexican photojournalist Julia Le Duc, and it instantly lodged in a terrible hall of fame, one that includes a naked Kim Phúc fleeing a napalm strike in Nick Ut's 1972 photo and Nilüfer Demir's shot of a drowned Syrian toddler, Alan Kurdi, on a Turkish beach in 2015. These are not “classic" images. They are evidence of desperation and inhumanity.
Such photographs generate instant controversy in the digital age, when all sides of an argument can be voiced with nuance or at top volume, and often both. The arguments can have to do with how sorry a viewer is supposed to feel for the victims; in this case, anti-immigrant partisans are saying such people as Óscar Ramírez bring calamity upon themselves, while others point to the larger political and policy measures that back families like his into corners.
It's the children, the blameless innocents, that make these images inviolable and irresistible, that turns them into both semiotic weapons and clickbait. “This is the photo that encapsulates the cruelty of the Trump era," wrote Zack Beauchamp in Vox. It is the shorthand immediacy of an image like this that renders it a speechless op-ed column and causes it to be snapped up by news bureaus around the world. No editor in his or her right mind would pass up the chance to use this photo, one so obviously headed for the history books.
But maybe they should think a little harder about it.
In addition to the political storm over Le Duc's photograph, there's also a contentious cultural battle over who “owns" such images, how they're used in the public square, and whether that use honors or dishonors the lives and memory of the people in them.
Plenty of people, in America and around the world, on Facebook and on Twitter, shared the photo from the border, most saying some version of “this has to be seen" and “don't look away." Others quailed, describing the photo but not linking to it. Others made a case that such images trade ghoulishly on our fascination with death, that we're drawn to them because of the taboo they cross and not simply for the sufferings they capture.
And still others noted that many of the death images that transfix whole populations and become pivots of history tend to involve nonwhite victims — that Western news media outlets don't balk at showing us dead foreigners but shy from similar photographs of Americans. We know what the civilian victims of violence in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars look like. We don't want to see the US dead. They look too much like we're supposed to.
Le Duc's photograph occupies a gray area. It illustrates a sociopolitical tragedy — an avoidable one, one that has been caused — with a simplicity that breaks through the background chatter. The details both compel and obscure. Little Valeria's body is tucked inside her father's T-shirt, and her arm is wrapped protectively, beseechingly around his neck. They are face down in the water, a fused unity of failed yearning. We don't see their faces, as we don't see the full face of Alan Kurdi on that Mediterranean beach. If we did, it would be too unbearable, too confrontational. It would force us to contemplate our own complicity and inaction.
This is important. This is how people become signifiers for larger ideas and events. Kim Phúc is now 56 years old, lifelong friends with Nick Ut, her rescuer/memorializer, but she will always be that screaming, terrified child in our heads. The Ramírezes aren't as lucky. They're just icons now. It's how the dead get used.
How do you feel about that use? Is it fair to use the bodies of Óscar Ramírez and his 2-year-old daughter to make America and the world face up to the consequence of US border policy? To discomfit comfortable readers, prompt them finally to ask what they can do and then maybe even do it? Many would say yes. I would say yes. Is it fair to Ramírez's widow, Tania Ávalos? Even she might say yes, after she's done grieving in ways you and I may never have to contend with.
But just as important, I think, is to look them in the eye, not in death but as they were in life. There are photos going around the Internet of father, mother, and daughter alive and happy, disseminated by those who knew them and who want us to know, too — to know that they're not only symbols for the history books but individual human beings who had talents and quirks, who messed up in all the usual small ways and dreamed in all the big ones. That's how you rescue the memory of Óscar and Valeria Ramírez. That's how you make them more than today's media atrocity.
Only when you see them in their specificity do you realize they're just like you.

Trump passed on climate change. What will Dems do?; another viewpoint

Texto completo: At his campaign launch last week, President Trump boasted to supporters that he had saved them from Hillary Clinton and would save them from illegal immigrants. He said nothing about saving the state from climate change.
Yet five months ago the Brookings Institution issued just the latest credible study naming Florida among the states most at risk from climate change. Failure to reverse the effects of global warming would hurt the economies of South Florida, Tampa Bay and Orlando, where Trump spoke. Those economies basically drive the state.
Last week, Trump announced that he would end Obama-era restrictions on coal plant emissions. He wanted them "boom, gone." With that action, Trump again showed that he cares more about a coal-producing state like Pennsylvania - and it's far from the biggest - than he does about Florida. He cares more about protecting dirty, coal-fired power plants than about protecting Florida.
Yet Trump, despite his claims, has not revived a dying industry. The government predicts that domestic coal consumption will decrease this year by 13 percent after hitting a 39-year low last year. Coal exports will drop by 15 percent.
That's because, like Florida Power & Light, more utilities will keep switching to cleaner natural gas. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, will continue to get cheaper.
Since Trump shows no sign of wanting to expand his electorate, he focuses on polls that regularly have shown Democratic voters much more concerned about climate change. Sentiment, however, is shifting.
In the last few months, Republican senators have proposed energy policies to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. Newer polls show that younger voters in both parties worry about the issue. "Denying the basic existence of climate change," GOP pollster Whit Ayres told The New York Times, "is no longer a credible position."
Like Rick Scott, when he was governor, Trump doesn't share that view. Politico reported last week that the Agriculture Department under Trump has failed to publicize studies from its well-regarded researchers showing the impact of climate change on crops. One such study warned that climate change could reduce the nutritional value of rice, which comprises more than half the diet for 600 million people in Asia.
It would be in Republicans' interest to demand policies that address climate change. Studies show that most of the states facing the greatest potential harm voted for Trump. In Florida and other Southeastern states, global warming could decimate crops.
Midwestern farm states also are Trump country. Because of what one meteorologist called "unprecedented" spring flooding, some farmers couldn't plant a crop. Again, climate change explains part of the misery.
Scientists note that warmer water in the Gulf of Mexico put more moisture in the air. Ice is melting at terrifying speed in the Arctic, which had an abnormally warm spring. That phenomenon pushed cold air into the Midwest to meet the moist air. Deluges followed.
Similarly, climate change turned Hurricane Harvey into a rain machine over Houston in 2017. It did the same with Hurricane Florence over the Carolinas last year. A recent report in the journal Nature said climate change could disrupt the wind shear barrier that helps to protect Florida's Atlantic coast from hurricanes.
Trump's response? Most recently, the Trump administration refused to sign a document related to protecting the Arctic unless it contained no reference to climate change. Worse, he has ordered all government reports on climate change to make no projections beyond 2040. Without policy changes, the most catastrophic effects would show themselves in 2050.
Governments such as Miami Beach that shun willful ignorance are preparing. Delray Beach commissioned a study showing that the city must spend nearly $400 million to defend itself against rising seas. This month, the South Florida Water Management District board heard that the agency will need to spend as much as $70 million a year to protect water wells in southern Florida from saltwater intrusion and to protect against flooding.
Wednesday and Thursday night, the Democrats who want to oppose Trump will debate in downtown Miami. It's their chance to show that they actually care about Florida.

Gates: Don't let women's equality take 208 years

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. You read that right. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
On the political front, women are 51% of the U.S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries — including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi — the U.S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization — Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.

ORDINANCE WOULD BAN DISCRIMINATION ON STONEWALL ANNIVERSARY, PITTSBURGH LAWMAKERS SEEK TO PROTECT GENDER IDENTITY AND EXPRESSION

Texto completo: To commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, Pittsburgh City Council introduced legislation Tuesday to strengthen protections for the LGBTQ community.
"In 1969, I was 15 years old, but the story of Stonewall reached me and affected my life," council President Bruce Kraus said, recalling the days of demonstrations sparked by a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City.
"In 1972, I came out and I've had the privilege of living as an openly gay man for the last 47 years. In that time, we have made great strides. Yet, so much remains to be done."
Surrounded by members of Pittsburgh's transgender community and activists representing different generations and faiths, Mr. Kraus and Councilwoman Erika Strassburger announced the legislation to a crowd of roughly 50 at an "intersectional" news conference Tuesday on the portico of the City-County Building.
The proposed ordinance would add gender identity and gender expression to the list of protected classes under the city's anti-discrimination code. The ordinance also would replace gendered language - he or she - with "the individual," "them" and "their" throughout the code.
Pittsburgh's anti-discrimination code, enforced by the city's Commission on Human Relations, protects against discriminatory practices in employment, housing and public accommodations.
"We have heard from residents who call our office, and they have been told things like they need to 'prove their gender,' they need documentation of their gender, or that this wasn't 'the right place for people like them,'" said Megan Stanley, interim director of the commission. "These comments are not OK, and they can quickly lead to discrimination in housing, employment or public accommodations."
Ms. Stanley and others pointed out that the localized protections would exceed state and federal protections.
"It is confounding that there's legislation sitting in Harrisburg right now that would allow people to have the rights given to others, that would basically say that you won't lose your housing, can't be fired for who you are, and yet our state Legislature won't even bring it up for a vote," Mayor Bill Peduto said, referring to a state House bill sponsored by Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Squirrel Hill.
The bill was referred to the State Government Committee, chaired by Rep. Garth Everett, R-Lycoming, whose office confirmed Tuesday that he does not support it.
Receiving the loudest and most sustained applause was Maria Montano, a Service Employees International Union labor activist and a transgender woman. She compared the Trump administration's consideration of narrowly defining sex with genetic testing - as outlined in a memo obtained by The New York Times in 2018 - to a "21st-century bathroom strip search."
"Every day I get up and face a world that is filled with people attempting to dehumanize me," she said.
Council is expected to discuss the legislation next week.

Texto completo: Tiffany Cabán tiene una pequeña ventaja sobre la presidenta del condado de Queens, Melinda Katz , con más del 94% de los votos contados en los resultados preliminares de la elección primaria demócrata, aunque la brecha es de alrededor de 1,000 votos de los 75,000 votos registrados hasta el momento, reporta CSNY.
Con los resultados que muestran una carrera casi de empate, la batalla demócrata por la nominación del fiscal del distrito de Queens está al final el martes, igualando el frenesí de los medios de comunicación que se desarrolló alrededor de la carrera.
A pesar de contar con un total de seis candidatos, la mayor parte de la atención se ha prestado a la batalla entre Katz, que cuenta con un apoyo significativo de sus colegas electos y los principales sindicatos, y Cabán, una defensora pública de 31 años que ha montado una ola de apoyo de votantes progresista, con respaldos de la representante Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez y The New York Times .
También en la carrera están Gregory Lasak , un ex juez, y los abogados Mina Malik, Betty Lugo y José Nieves.
El concejal Rory Lancman se retiró de la elección, pero permanece en la boleta electoral.
Las urnas cerraron a las 9 p.m., y estamos actualizando esta publicación con los últimos resultados no oficiales de la Junta de Elecciones de la Ciudad de Nueva York.
Tiffany Cabán: 39.39%
Melinda Katz: 38.5%
Gregory L. Lasak: 14.41%
Mina Quinto Malik: 3.86%
* Rory I. Lancman: 1.38%

Texto completo: President Donald Trump applied maximum pressure on North Korea, and it is continuing to produce nuclear weapons.
He applied maximum pressure on China, and we may be facing a trade war.
He applied maximum pressure on Venezuela, exacerbating hunger in the streets but leaving the dictatorship in place.
He applied maximum pressure on Palestinians, who responded by refusing to meet administration officials.
Most worrying of all, Trump applied maximum pressure on Iran, and we may now be on the brink of war.
In each of these cases, Trump pursued aggressive tactics without any obvious strategy. The tactics themselves often proved quite successful at inflicting misery, but this simply led several countries to double down on belligerence in ways that endanger the United States - and that is particularly true of Iran.
Trump says he called off military strikes on Thursday - thank goodness! - but he adheres to a failed policy that has put Iran back on a potential track to nuclear weapons. He is improvising, confusing friend and foe alike, even as he plays a perilous game of chicken with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Trump seems to inhabit a fantasy world in which his abandonment of the Obama nuclear deal with Iran, along with sanctions and bellicose tweets, will force Iran to roll up its nuclear program. Instead, Trump's tactics have, quite predictably, led Iran to lash out.
Some Americans speak blithely about "surgical strikes," and I fear that many Americans, including those in the White House, don't get how badly these can go awry.
If we kill 150 Iranians in a set of airstrikes, as Trump says had been anticipated, Iranian proxy forces will retaliate by killing Americans in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and elsewhere around the world. Iran or its proxies might strike at Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure, while also interrupting the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz. We might see Hezbollah strikes on Israel and a new Israel-Lebanon war. The global economy could take a significant hit.
The conflict may start "surgical," but it's unlikely to end that way.
It's essential that we clarify the location of the U.S. drone that Iran shot down and delay any action until that question is resolved. Trump insists that the drone was in international airspace, while Iran says it had intruded over Iranian territory.
The Times quoted a senior administration official as acknowledging that it may in fact have violated Iranian airspace; if so and the administration is caught lying to the world, this will be an enormous self-inflicted blow. Iran's decision to shoot down a drone in its own airspace would be understandable; certainly the United States would shoot down an Iranian drone that intruded over our territory.
The national security adviser, John Bolton, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, reportedly are pushing for military action. Both are longtime hawks, with Bolton urging in 2015 that "to stop Iran's bomb, bomb Iran." Bravo to uniformed officers in the Pentagon for pushing back and warning of the dangers of escalation.
I suggest this principle of foreign policy: Hawks who were completely wrong about Iraq should refrain from jingoism about Iran.
What can be done to reduce the risk of war? Here are four steps for Trump to take:
1. Ensure that U.S. forces fire only in clear self-defense or on presidential orders, to reduce the risk of an accident. In 1988, the USS Vincennes shot down what the crew believed was a threatening Iranian military jet. In fact, the airplane was a civilian Iranian airliner, and all 290 people onboard were killed.
2. Try to organize an international force to protect ship traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. This would present a united front against Iranian provocations and reduce the risk of a limpet mine starting a war.
3. Disentangle the United States from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which have played a pernicious role (along with Israel) in encouraging belligerence toward Iran (the Senate took a landmark step in the right direction a few days ago by voting to block weapons sales to Saudi Arabia). The blundering Saudi efforts to challenge Iran have so far backfired in Qatar, Lebanon and, most tragically, Yemen, so Trump should listen carefully to what the Saudi crown prince says - and then do the opposite.
4. Seek secret talks with Iran to patch back together the nuclear agreement.
These approaches may not succeed, but the stakes are high enough that they are worth trying. War is sometimes necessary; this is not one of those times.
Trump's maximum pressure has been a failure in country after country, and I fear that his cancellation of airstrikes on Thursday may have simply deferred a military clash with Iran. The two countries remain on a collision path, with few face-saving exit ramps, and with hard-liners on each side escalating and empowering those on the other. Look out.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Monday again denied assaulting a columnist for Elle magazine in the dressing room of a high-end clothing store more than 20 years ago, countering her explosive accusation by asserting that he would not have assaulted her because "she's not my type."
Mr. Trump said that E. Jean Carroll, who wrote for years for Elle magazine, was "lying" when she said that he threw her up against a wall and forced himself on her in the mid-1990s, and he insisted that he did not know her.
"I'll say it with great respect," he said in an interview with The Hill, a Capitol Hill news organization. "No. 1, she's not my type. No. 2, it never happened. It never happened, O.K.?"
Earlier Monday, Ms. Carroll spoke about an excerpt from her new book -- "What Do We Need Men For?" -- that was published in New York magazine. She said in an interview on CNN that Mr. Trump threw her up against a wall so hard that "I hit my head really hard: boom." She said that she tried to fight back against Mr. Trump's violent advances in a fitting room of Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan.
In the Hill interview, Mr. Trump said Ms. Carroll was making up the story. "Totally lying. I don't know anything about her," he said. "I know nothing about this woman. I know nothing about her. She is -- it's just a terrible thing that people can make statements like that."
Mr. Trump in the past has rejected other sexual assault accusations by asserting that the women who accused him of taking advantage of them were not attractive enough to engage in such behavior.
"Believe me, she would not be my first choice, that I can tell you," Trump told supporters at a campaign event in 2016 after a woman accused him of putting his hand up her skirt while on an airplane. "You don't know. That would not be my first choice." As the crowd laughed, he said, "Check out her Facebook, you'll understand."
The fitting room episode took place in late 1995 or early 1996, according to Ms. Carroll, who said Monday that Mr. Trump asked her to model lingerie that he was looking to purchase. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to Marla Maples.
"The minute he closed that door, I was banged up against the wall," Ms. Carroll said during an appearance on "New Day" with Alisyn Camerota. "I want women to know that I did not stand there. I did not freeze. I was not paralyzed, which is a reaction I could have had because it was so shocking. No, I fought."
[Our executive editor revisits how The Times initially handled E. Jean Carroll's allegations against President Trump.]
Ms. Carroll said the release in October 2016 of the "Access Hollywood" video in which Mr. Trump boasted of sexual assault to the television host Billy Bush was validation for her. CNN played the 2005 clip during Ms. Carroll's appearance on Monday.
"It knocked me back; I felt relief," Ms. Carroll said. "We have to change this culture of sexual violence."
More than a dozen women have accused Mr. Trump of sexual misconduct that they said took place before he was elected president.
"It's the same," Ms. Carroll said. "He denies it. He turns it around. He attacks and then he threatens. I am sick of it. Think how many women have come forward. Nothing happens."
Ms. Carroll, 75, stopped short of using the word "rape" on Monday to characterize the episode, which she said in the New York magazine excerpt that she disclosed to two friends at the time. One urged her to report it to the police, while a journalist friend warned her to keep quiet because Mr. Trump would "bury you." The New York Times spoke to the two friends, who confirmed that Ms. Carroll had spoken about it with them but said they did not want to be identified.
"I have difficulty with the word," Ms. Carroll, the author of "Ask E. Jean" in Elle, said Monday. "I see it as a fight. He pulled down my tights. It was over very quickly. It was against my will 100 percent."
Ms. Carroll rejected the president's contention that she was motivated by publicity for her book.
"Male authors never get this question," Ms. Carroll said. "It was not about selling a book about Donald Trump."
In a statement on Friday, the president said he had never met Ms. Carroll, but the two were photographed together at a party in 1987 with Ms. Carroll's former husband, John Johnson. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that the image was misleading.
"Standing with my coat on in a line?" Mr. Trump said. "Give me a break -- with my back to the camera? I have no idea who she is."
Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Neil Vigdor from New York.

Texto completo: THE WEST
If you've been blaming natural gas emissions for contributing to climate disruption, well, you need to rethink your attitude and be more gung-ho and patriotic. That's what the Trump administration is doing, bragging that our export of liquefied natural gas to Europe ranks right up there with American troops helping to defeat the Nazis during World War II. Thus the new term "freedom gas" - instead of natural gas - coined by Energy Secretary Rick Perry. In a press release, Steven Weinberg, an assistant Energy Department secretary for fossil energy, waxed poetic in a semi-scientific fashion, praising the government for selling "molecules of U.S. freedom" to the benighted world. Jason Bor-doff, an energy policy expert at Columbia University, called this phrasing "bizarre" and mocked it on Twitter: "Personally, I don't think this goes far enough, and would like to request that its data metric be changed from mcf (million cubic feet) to musf (molecules of US freedom)," reports EcoWatch. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who is running for president on a platform of combating climate change, said that the term "freedom gas" reminded him of Republican attempts to re-label French fries as "freedom fries" during the run-up to our invasion of Iraq. "Freedom is generally good," acknowledged Inslee, "but freedom from glaciers, freedom from clean air, freedom from healthy forests that aren't on fire, and freedom from the world we know and cherish is not what we seek." The New York Times reported that the Trump administration was also altering "the methodology" of government climate reports to paint a happier picture of the consequences of burning fossil fuels.
COLORADO
Landslides caused by heavy rains have closed some roads for weeks at a time in western Colorado, but when a gigantic boulder weighing 4,250 tons smashed onto a state highway near the small town of Dolores, the state highway department faced a daunting problem: How could it possibly remove the behemoth when no bulldozer was big enough to do the job? The solution was to let sleeping boulders lie, diverting the road around either side of what will now be known as
"Memorial Rock," since it fell on Memorial Day weekend. Or maybe not. A Denver Post poll of nearly 900 readers found they want the governor to name it "Rocky McRocker Face," with "Rocky Road" their second choice. "Tourist Trap" came in a distant third.
MONTANA
The osprey nest was precariously perched about 25 feet up on a telephone pole, reports the Missoulian, when something began making it wobble and rattle. Thanks to a live camera feed recorded by Explore.org, you can see the cause of the commotion: An intrepid black bear, whose snout pokes up on the lower left of the screen. Then the raider's whole head pops up near the nest's three eggs, while an agitated osprey continually swoops past, trying to protect its nest. Finally, the bear climbs back down and ambles off. Denver Holt, who set up the camera at his Owl Research Institute near the town of Charlo, Montana, said he'd never before seen a bear try to climb the telephone pole. Live cameras have shown him other amazing sights, though. Once, a great horned owl flew to the osprey nest in the dark, Holt said, and whacked the male osprey, whom Holt calls Charlie, "right off his perch three nights in a row. The attacks are unbelievable. You wonder how he survives." Holt's cameras also revealed that great gray owls are more active at night, and that they sometimes fight with great horned owls: "The cameras expose some really cool behavioral stuff."
COLORADO
After working for 37 years for the Bureau of Land Management in several Western states, Jim Cagney is now retired and sounding off. His deft columns for the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel are always a treat, because when it comes to the outback, he knows what he's talking about. Recently, one of his targets included the newspaper itself, after a headline in its lifestyle section cheered the "glory of going off-road." That "glory," wrote Cagney, might better be described as destructive driving behavior. Cagney also slammed a TV commercial that was widely shown this spring, in which a vehicle rips up a wet cow pasture. "Who likes to chase calves with their car?" Cagney asks. "How could a video that disgusting generate car sales?" People should think before they start their engines, Cagney advises: Motorized travel on lawful routes through backcountry public lands is OK, but "off-road travel is heinous."
IDAHO
Is it cruel to fool a fish? In a way, that's what catch-and-release anglers do when they hook a fish, hold it up to admire and maybe photograph it, then remove the hook before letting the fish swim away. But some conservationists say that catch-and-release stresses fish and impedes their chances of survival by exposing them to air, perhaps several times during the season. According to six studies by the University of Idaho and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, however, the fish don't seem all that bothered by being handled. Once a fish is hooked, reeling it in takes little time, and the fish isn't held out of the water for more than several seconds, reports the Lewis-ton Tribune. How the fish feel about the practice of catch-and-eat was not studied.

Texto completo: The heavy hit of a bowling ball on a wooden lane and the sharp cracks of crashing pins create a blue-collar melody that millions enjoy nightly. The United States' most popular participatory sport has brought about hours of wholesome family time, but until the tide began to turn in New York City, it had an unseemly reputation, according to new research.
" ... Bowling was 'almost a dirty word' in the 1930s, affiliated with 'beer guzzlers, low types, and shabby quarters,'" journalist and Columbia University professor Nick Hirshon writes in  "A Forgotten Pioneer in Sports Television: Phillies Jackpot Bowling (1959-1960)," published earlier this month in the journal American Journalism. 
"Back in the '30s, '40s, and '50s, bowling had an unsavory reputation. It was something people did in the back of a bar. It was something that kids skipped school to do," he said in an interview.
From the early 1900s, action bowlers - those who played for money - were influenced by New York's mafia families and people looking for easy money. The scenes were often in the back alley of pubs and would be filled with cigarette smoke, dirt, grit, guns and knives with mostly men playing for money and their lives, according to author and "Bowlers Journal International" editor Gianmarc Manzione, originally of Bay Ridge.
"Even as bowling became an indoor sport with Knickerbocker Alley in New York in the mid-19th century, it was still a gambling activity," the now Tampa, Florida, resident said. 
Some of the most popular indoor sites were based in Queens in places 89-year-old bowling hall of famer Jack Clemente remembers well.
He recalled a time when he watched action bowling hustler Iggy Russo fake a heart attack during the 10th frame of a game to avoid losing a bet, a tale memorialized in The New York Times.
"When he was bowling, the mafia told him they were going to kill him. They said if you wanna live, you're gonna dump the game and they showed him their gun," he said. Then, he remembers, Russo swung his arm back to throw the ball and suddenly collapsed, holding his chest. "People call the ambulance and he gets away. And then he gets about 10 blocks out and he tells them, 'let me out here, I'm alright'."
Russo's melee with the mafia is just one of many stories that deterred families from going to bowling alleys until "Phillies Jackpot Bowling" came on the air, according to Hirshon's research. From 1959 to 1960, average Joe bowlers from around the country competed on the show to get the most strikes and win a jackpot. 
When the show came to New York from New Jersey in 1959, it dropped the "Phillies" from the title and set up shop at Hollywood Bowling Lanes in Rego Park. It later moved to Woodhaven Lanes in Glendale.
"Shows like that helped provide an aspirational model to those who were trying to make a living doing the thing they loved," said Manzione. "I think New York, for a lot of reasons, was an inevitable setting for something like that." 
Bowling had already been growing in popularity for a few years, but according to Hirshon, the show was what really ignited bowling's mainstream fandom.
"I think Woodhaven Lanes in particular brought a sort of prestige," Hirshon said. "When people just see a bowling alley like that - 60 lanes, brand new - it just had a certain aura about it that previous bowling alleys in the back of a little bar weren't going to bring." 
Hirshon believes it was the famous hosts, including Yankees broadcaster Mel Allen, as well as the large payouts that helped pave the way as well. One of the largest jackpots on the show  -  of $33,000 - went to 47-year-old teacher, Frank Clause, from Pennsylvania, who earned his claim to fame at Woodhaven Lanes.
Clemente was on the show as well, but his winnings weren't quite so steep.
"I didn't do well at all. Twice I lost to the same guy," he chuckled over the phone. "But what can I say, luck or whatever it was, I just didn't have it."
"Jackpot Bowling" eventually landed in the gutter. After 11 months in New York, the show moved to Los Angeles, where it was canceled after 26 weeks.
But New York's impact on the sport has lasted for decades, taking it from being a dirty game in the alleys of Queens to one that everyone in the five bor

Drake, 'Omertà'
Drake featuring Rick Ross, 'Money in the Grave'

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In between the Toronto Raptors winning their first N.B.A. championship and Drake posting thirst traps on his Instagram to announce that he's been in "album mode" came this pair of songs, dubbed "The Best in the World Pack." Whether that's a reference to his beloved basketball team or to himself doesn't matter: a championship for one is a championship for all. "Money in the Grave" is Drake at his moody, petulant peak -- a morbid anthem for a hot summer. But the real sneers are on "Omertà," which is one long-stretch verse, no chorus. Drake more or less free associates his boasts here, even leaning into a signature Biggie Smalls flow to emphasize his comfort. In the wake of his hometown's triumph, he's feeling as blustery as ever: "I wish that I was playing in a sport where we were getting rings/I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything." JON CARAMANICA
Ashley O, 'On a Roll'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
This up-with-life synth-pop remaking of Nine Inch Nails' "Head Like a Hole" ("I'm on a roll/Riding so high/Achieving my goals") is sung by Miley Cyrus in her role as Ashley O, the pop megastar suffering under managerial cruelty in an episode of the new season of "Black Mirror." The real-life "Black Mirror" is that it's the most effective Miley song of the past five or so years. CARAMANICA
Spoon, 'No Bullets Spent'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The new song on Spoon's hits collection, due in July, is "No Bullets Spent," which circles back toward the lean, guitar-driven indie rock of the Texas band's first albums. The song arrives in a psychedelic vocal-harmony haze but soon solidifies into a hard-nosed sketch of a desperate situation. Over little more than than syncopated guitars and a drumbeat, Britt Daniel sings about a 22-year-old saddled with a mortgage and the ominous return of a "master" at the door, wishing for some miraculous "escape from the mess." It won't be pretty: "What we need now's an accident/No one to blame and no bullets spent." JON PARELES
Philip Bailey, 'We're a Winner'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Many of today's jazz innovators have as much in common with the funk and soul musicians of the 1970s and '80s as they do with the generation of jazz improvisers that directly preceded them. Philip Bailey -- the vocalist, percussionist and central member of Earth, Wind & Fire -- became aware of this when he first heard the keyboardist Robert Glasper a few years ago. Glasper wound up producing many of the tracks on Bailey's new album, "Love Will Find a Way," and on this cover of Curtis Mayfield's "We're a Winner," the keyboardist's longtime collaborator Bilal joins in, fortifying Bailey's familiar falsetto with some lissome backing vocals ("Movin' on up!"). Underneath, Glasper traces out a sparkling reharmonization of the song's original chord pattern over a big, fathomless bed of bass from Derrick Hodge. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO
Black Midi, 'Ducter'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Choose your jitters. During its nearly seven minutes, "Ducter" alternates between an insistent, minimal guitar vamp -- with drums sputtering and erupting behind it -- and a seething grunge guitar buildup that starts out slow and soon boils over. A sporadic vocal, in guises from calm voice-over to croon to scream, insists, "It could not break me." PARELES
Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello, 'Señorita'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
A heavy sigh to this soft-boiled Enron of Latin-pop-but-not-quite song-of-the-summer bait. CARAMANICA
Baby Rose, 'Mortal'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
There's a deep, primal quaver in Baby Rose's voice that makes it arresting from its first note. In "Mortal," she testifies to an overwhelming longing -- one that threatens to drown her -- in an eerie track that compounds both her need and her disorientation. Guitar chords outline a slow waltz; a backup choir joins her and sometimes wanders away from her; heard through headphones, phantom voices arise from behind and above. The song ends with her just as unmoored as she was when it began. PARELES
NLE Choppa featuring Blueface, 'Shotta Flow Remix'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
The beat for "Shotta Flow" -- which has catapulted the young Memphis rapper NLE Choppa out of obscurity and into the maw of label bidding wars -- is an inebriated tinkle of a thing, part pounding and part meandering. For the last six months, it's stood out as one of the year's rowdiest and most infectious hip-hop songs, thanks to the way NLE Choppa bounces on top the beat (and bounces his way through a variety of dance moves in the video). The song's official remix features Blueface, another of this year's viral lightning bolts, though in this context he's an elder. In the video, directed by Cole Bennett, the two yuk-yuk it up at a backyard barbecue, careering between menacing threats and goofy dances, tough guys who are also kids on a lark. CARAMANICA
Emel Mathlouthi, 'Rescuer'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
"Rescuer" previews "Everywhere We Looked Was Burning," the first album in English by Emel Mathlouthi, a Tunisian singer who emerged during the Arab Spring. As she sings about a mysterious experience, the sustained, modal melody and stretches of drone harmony hint at North African and Arab underpinnings, while its electric and electronic instruments pulse and hover in virtual space, maintaining the enigma. PARELES
Nature Work, 'Porch Time'
The alto saxophonist Greg Ward and the bass clarinetist Jason Stein are two of Chicago's most entrancing woodwind players, each as brightly articulate as he is evasive and contrarian. They often find themselves on the same gigs, typically in other people's bands, but they recently decided to start Nature Work, a collective quartet of their own, with the indomitable Eric Revis on bass and the bushwhacking drummer Jim Black. On Stein's "Porch Time," from the band's self-titled debut, a whispery convocation builds into nervous, reeling flurry; eventually the group establishes a freckly rhythm, horns dipping and dashing over a slanted bass pattern. Finally, Stein and Ward take turns blowing sparks over top. RUSSONELLO
Spaza, 'Sunlight, Glycerine, 2 Loose Draws'
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Devotees of Shabaka Hutchings will already be aware that there's a fleet of young South African musicians who have taken a renewed interest in the spiritual-jazz sound of the 1970s, and are turning its tools into something fresh and deep. The new sextet Spaza includes two members of Shabaka and the Ancestors (the British saxophonist's collaboration with Mzansi musicians), plus other young vocalists and instrumentalists based in Johannesburg or Soweto. On "Sunlight, Glycerine, 2 Loose Draws," voices, electronics, acoustic instruments and percussion make a humid, sultry stew. Their cyclical patterns may call to mind the steady tread of an evening walk in the woods, the comforts of nature and the danger of darkness closing in around you. RUSSONELLO

Personality is Trump's biggest obstacle in 2020

Texto completo: "What's your pitch to the swing voter on the fence?" ABC's George Stephanopoulos asked President Donald Trump in an interview that aired Sunday.
Questions of this sort are gifts to politicians, but interviewers ask them for a couple of reasons. One, they're civic-minded. Politicians deserve the opportunity to make their cases straightforwardly - and voters deserve to hear them. Second, they save time. If you give your subject a free shot to get the talking points out of the way, you can move on to the more interesting stuff.
Mr. Trump's initial answer started off following the standard script. He got four words off that must have had his political advisers cheering, "Safety, security, great economy."
Ideally, this is where Mr. Trump should have stopped talking.
But the president kept going, boasting that he won 52 percent of the women's vote in 2016. He didn't; that was the white women's vote; he got 41 percent of women overall, according to exit polls. Then, Mr. Trump talked about how the economy would help him with minorities.
"So," Mr. Stephanopoulos asked, "that's the pitch?"
Mr. Trump briefly got back on message. "No, I have no pitch," he said. "You know what I have? The economy is phenomenal. We've rebuilt our military. We're taking care of our vets. We're doing the best job that anybody's done probably as a first-term president. ..."
This was another good place to stop. But he was only getting warmed up: "I have a phony witch hunt, which is just a phony pile of stuff. Mueller comes out. There's no collusion. And essentially a ruling that no obstruction. ..."
And then Mr. Trump was off to the races, fighting with Mr. Stephanopoulos about what the Mueller report did or didn't say.
And that's the problem for Mr. Trump. When you talk to people who think Mr. Trump will be re-elected, they point to conventional rules about how a good economy makes voters want to stay the course. That's superficially plausible, but it leaves out the single most important fact of the political landscape: Mr. Trump's personality.
A good economy doesn't necessarily speak for itself. Normal presidents stay on message to deny the press the ability to talk about more interesting stuff. The only talking point Mr. Trump can be counted on to stick to is himself. Hence, his claim to Mr. Stephanopoulos that no one has been treated worse than him.
Mr. Trump doesn't want the election to be about the economy, he wants it - and everything else - to be about him. His exchange with Mr. Stephanopoulos was an analogue of every Trump rally. He runs through the talking points about the economy or conservative judges as quickly as possible so he can get to the really important topic: Donald Trump.
The problem for Mr. Trump is that if the central question of the election is him, he will lose because he is not popular.
The Trump campaign's internal polling, which was leaked last week, showed him trailing Joe Biden in several must-win states by wide margins. Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, said the polls were irrelevant because it was "ancient" data from last March, taken before he was "exonerated" by the Mueller report. But Mr. Trump's post-Mueller-report approval ratings haven't improved. Trump's sub-50 percent approval rating has had the least variation of any president since World War II. Most people have made up their minds about him, and most of them don't like him.
The campaign responded by saying it had fresh data showing solid support from "informed voters." Mr. Parscale told ABC News that since March, "we have seen huge swings in the president's favor across the 17 states we have polled, based on the policies now espoused by the Democrats."
The key words there are "informed voters." According to the New York Times, the polls Mr. Parscale described were "informed ballot" polls that described Democrats in negative ways before asking about support for Mr. Trump.
The common wisdom among pollsters is that if you're citing informed-ballot polls, you're losing. But even taken at face value, the meaning of these polls is that some voters could be persuaded to vote for Mr. Trump if they could be convinced they were voting on issues rather than Mr. Trump. For that to work, Mr. Trump would have to stop acting like Mr. Trump and make the message about something other than him. That's a tall order.

China’s Great Firewall and the end of globalization

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: The Great Firewall of China—Beijing’s AI-powered website blocker, used to shut down Western media penetration—is spelling an end to the era of globalization. While digital tech encompasses the world, the East and the West have hardened into two separate spheres. There is no looking back.
Through the Great Firewall, China’s leadership has turned off nearly every major English-language news outlet, from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal on down. The Washington Post and the Guardian, two of the last survivors, were zeroed our in time for the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Social media has not been spared. All the big US platforms and services, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, are access denied; group chat applications like WhatsApp are firmly out of reach.
Companies including Google have struggled, sometimes secretly, to figure out how to get back into the Chinese market, even if it means working on much cozier or even riskier terms with the country’s military than Americans—and their own workers—are ready to tolerate. The dream of one globally integrated world, networks and ultimately controlled by the masters of the internet, dies hard.
But it has died. Nowhere is the digital divide between East and West sharper than it is where Hong Kong stops and the rest of China begins. Rebellion against a draconian extradition law that would see Hong Kong residents spirited away to the mainland for punishment made national Western headlines, with huge crowds spilling into the streets—and voluntarily shutting down their own online activity to frustrate or defeat Chinese monitoring.
That’s a long way from the days of the Arab Spring, when autocratic regimes put their internets on lockdown to stop protests from mobilizing into more serious political opposition. Today, governments have learned how to reassert sovereignty over their digital domains—not just how to pull the plug.
But for China the two are hardly mutually exclusive. The goal is no Western media, just as Western religion, which is seen to breed rampant heresy, instability, and factionalism, is being all but expunged from the country. China’s digital plan is to remoralize its billion-plus population before venality and vice wrecks civil society.
That’s frighteningly Orwellian to the West. In China, by contrast, the Orwellian imagination is unwelcome: both the fear of servility and the fear of mastery at the heart of 1984. Technological times have changed since Orwell’s day—digital rule is about the triumph of machine memory, not of Big Brother’s compulsory fantasies—but in the West, the dystopian vision endures. In China, no such millennia-old tradition of the slavery-and-mastery morality play exists.
It’s not that the Chinese can have no appreciation for freedom, of course; it’s that their experience with digital will simply not shape them and be shaped by them in the same way as we in the West will ours.
That alone marks a harsh lesson for Western elites. Those clinging bitterly to certitudes that more modernization, more money, or more engagement will eventually bring down the autocratic regime in favor of Western-style democracy are indulging in a fantasy every bit as dangerous as 2 + 2 = 5.
In technology, leading Westerners are beside themselves to see Chinese researchers and companies being squeezed out from American positions. But China has so penetrated strategic American tech and science that it would be negligent at best not to do so.
In academia, leading Westerners fear that the loss of lucrative Chinese students and access to brilliant Chinese graduate students will gobble America’s development of next-generation tools and patents. But the West has grown too lazy and comfortable leaning on outside talent while home-grown students become over-credentialed and under-employable ingrates with a resentful sense of entitlement and little game plan for the future.
And in entertainment media, leading Westerners have grown similarly dependent on “international”—read Chinese—audiences to prop up box office numbers, make movies marketable and produceable, and sustain the illusion that Hollywood and its power brokers hold real cultural authority in America and beyond. But the reality of a contracting and consolidating industry with little to say about life besides formulaic and narrow-cast cultural politics is inescapable.
The message China has sent the West’s elite, in other words, is painfully simple: you need us more than we need you. And the West agrees. It is Western elites, not Chinese ones, who are still hung up on the utopian dream of creating one harmonious and standardized world. China’s bid for international power hinges on its domestic priorities of preventing chaos, civil strife, and the collapse of its sovereignty; if Beijing thought it could lock its power in and fully establish state morality through the populace without a hugely risky intercontinental economic and infrastructure program, it likely would have gone in that direction. It didn’t.
And the West? It harbors three leading assets over the Chinese: its media apparatus, its military capability, and its financial power. Of these, the first has effectively been neutralized in China. The third is holding steady, but the second is showing cracks in its mystique. If China can use technology to make its absolute sovereign control over its culture and morality complete, it will consider itself to have the upper hand.
And if the West continues to fragment into weak and Balkanized camps dominated by bureaucratic revolutionaries at odds with their country’s histories and cultures, and ultimately their own countrymen, the Chinese will be right.

Texto completo: A second member of Washington's congressional delegation is calling for an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
Rep Adam Smith, D-Bellevue, said Friday that the events of the past several weeks have changed his stance and he now believes it's time to begin an inquiry.
"Congressman Smith believes we must move forward with an impeachment inquiry," Shana Chandler, Smith's chief of staff, said. "President Trump has continued his efforts to obstruct justice and undermine Congress as a coequal branch of government and proceeding with an impeachment inquiry - the first step in a lengthy and difficult process - is the best way to demand accountability from this administration."
Smith joins Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, as the lone members of Washington's delegation to call for the beginning of impeachment proceedings.
Washington's seven other Democratic members of Congress have all had harsh words for Trump and his administration's refusal to cooperate with House investigations, but have stopped short of calling for the start of the impeachment process.
There are now more than 70 House Democrats who have called for an impeachment inquiry, according to a New York Times tracker, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has declined to go along.
"I don't think you should have an inquiry unless you're ready to impeach," Pelosi told reporters this week. "I feel no pressure from my members to do anything. And I have no pressure on them to do anything."

Don't let women's equality take 208 years

Texto completo: If you want to keep a secret from the general public, a blog post about accelerating gender parity in globalization is probably a good place to hide it. Even a nerd like me recognizes that it can be hard to turn a new analysis of gender data into clickbait.
I'm going to try anyway, though, because in a blog post this week, the World Economic Forum released a new projection that demands our attention.
Based on data from its widely-respected Global Gender Gap Index, WEF estimates that it will take the United States another 208 years to reach gender equality. At the current pace of change, gender equality won't arrive in the U.S. until the year 2227.
Underneath triumphant headlines about women running for office in record numbers, changing the face of Congress and breaking glass ceilings are trend lines that tell a much more somber story about the pace of progress for women in our country.
Although women now earn college and graduate degrees at higher rates than men, they remain concentrated in certain majors and, early in their careers, they are often channeled into less lucrative jobs. Men are 70% more likely to be executives than women their same age. In 2018, there were more Fortune 500 CEOs named James than there were women.
On the political front, women are 51% of the U.S. population, but hold only 24% of seats in Congress. And unlike 59 other countries — including India, Israel, Liberia, Slovakia, Mali, and Malawi — the U.S. has yet to have a female head of state.
WEF's projection also reflects the grim reality that the U.S. is the only industrialized nation where maternal mortality rates are actually getting worse. The risks are especially high for African American women, who are three to four times more likely to die during or after delivery than white women.
While 208 is a damning, daunting number, it is not destiny. The projection is based on the assumption that the rate of change will remain constant. If we can accelerate the pace of progress, that number will start to go down. And therein lies our call to action.
I know from experience that a startling statistic can be an animating force. About 25 years ago, Bill and I learned from a New York Times article that in developing countries, hundreds of thousands of children were dying of diarrhea each year. Bill and I had already decided that we wanted to give the majority of the wealth from Microsoft away, but until that article, we weren't sure how. That data point gave us direction and ultimately led us to start our foundation.
As it turned out, we were far from alone in wanting to do something about the unconscionable number of children dying preventable deaths. Our foundation was quickly connected to a wide range of partners eager to play a role in driving progress. Together, we created a new organization — Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance — which has spurred a 40% decrease in the number of children in low-and-middle-income nations who die before their fifth birthday.
Once again, we find ourselves facing an urgent challenge that calls for new investment and collaboration. Shrinking the number 208 is going to require many people across many sectors. But I believe progress is possible, and as a philanthropist, I'm particularly interested in the role that philanthropy can play in accelerating it.
While comprehensive data on U.S. philanthropy is hard to find, there's evidence that gender equality in the U.S. has been chronically underfunded. Preliminary, unpublished research based on foundation data from Candid suggests that for every $1 spent on gender equality by private donors, there is $9.27 spent on higher education, and $4.85 spent on the arts. What's more, 90% of the money that is going toward women's issues is going toward women's reproductive health specifically. If we want to make gender equality a priority, we need to be spending more — and spreading those resources more broadly.
In addition to writing checks, philanthropists can play a critical role in driving progress by creating new platforms to bring people together. As we saw with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, it's essential to have a mechanism for getting a diverse range of stakeholders around the same table.
When it comes to the fight for gender equality, one of the most important assets we have is the huge array of people who are already activated — from the thousands of organizations that have been working on these issues for years to the more than 4 million women who joined women's marches across 600 cities. That's why I think there's a lot of potential in new efforts to channel existing energies and expertise more effectively into one broad-based assault on systemic inequality. My company, Pivotal Ventures, recently invested in two of these efforts — Time's Up and The Collaborative Fund for Women's Safety and Dignity. Both are creating new partnerships to tackle harassment, discrimination and inequality at scale.
The gender gaps in our country are real, and they aren't going away on their own — at least, not any time in the next 200 years. If we want to see them close in our lifetimes, we will need to come together to insist in one voice that equality can't wait. Over two decades ago, a statistic in a newspaper called me to action. I hope the statistic WEF published this week does the same for others. If we commit to being part of the solution, the number 208 is ours to reject.

Sanctions for now, but a strike possible

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Saturday he will impose additional sanctions on Iran to keep its leaders from developing nuclear weapons but added that a U.S. military strike is still on the table.
 A day after the president at the last minute abruptly scrapped a retaliatory strike on Iran after it shot down an unmanned U.S. drone, Trump said he would spend Saturday and Sunday at Camp David having meetings and conversations about Iran and its ambitions to become a nuclear power.
"We're moving forward with additional sanctions on Iran," Trump told reporters before he boarded the Marine One helicopter on the White House South Lawn. He didn't elaborate, but added that they would be in addition to "about as strong as sanctions grouping as you can possibly have on any country."
Asked if a military strike is still a possibility, Trump said, "We have a tremendously powerful military force in that area. It's always on the table until we get this solved."
 But Trump also offered the same deal to Iran's leaders as he has to North Korea's Kim Jung Un: Abandon the nuclear weapons programs and the United States will help boost their faltering economy.
"If Iran wants to become a wealthy nation again, become a prosperous nation - we'll call it, 'Let's make Iran great again,'" Trump said. "But they're never going to do it if they think in five or six years they're going to have a nuclear weapon."
Trump said he had received praise for deciding to scrub the attack on Iran because the estimated 150 Iranian deaths it might have caused would not be "proportionate" to the destruction of the drone.
Although he said Friday he pulled back 10 minutes before the planes were to launch -- only after he'd gotten the casualty estimates -- on Saturday he acknowledged he had estimates earlier in the day but had asked to know the potential death toll "as accurately as possible" before making the final decision.
"Everybody was saying I'm a warmonger. And now they say I'm a dove," he said. "And I think I'm neither, if you want to know the truth. I'm a man with common sense."
Trump also defended the planned immigration raids to round up noncitizens with court deportation orders as a step to reduce migration to the U.S. border The raids had been scheduled to start Sunday but Trump announced Saturday afternoon that he was postponing them at the request of the Democrats.
"These are people that came into the country illegally. They've been served, they've gone through a process, a process of the courts, and they have to be removed from the country," he said. "It's having a very big effect on the border."
And Trump denied allegations by New York writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused him in a book excerpt published Friday in New York magazine of sexually assaulting her more than two decades ago in a dressing room of an upscale Manhattan department store.
Carroll said she told two friends at the time, likely in 1995 or 1996, and the magazine published a photo of her shaking Trump's hand. She is the th woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct or assault.
"It's a totally false accusation. I have absolutely no idea who she is," Trump said.
"There's some picture where we're shaking hands, it looks like at event I have my coat on. I have my wife standing next to me," he said. "But I have no idea who she is."
The New York Times reported Saturday Trump chose not to go forward with the military strike because Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson told him that hawks among his advisers didn't have his interest at heart and if he got into a war with Iran he would lose the election.
Pressed on reports that the final estimate came from the White House counsel, Trump agreed that the Pentagon sent it through the White House. "But it was given to me by a general," he said.
Trump also acknowledged that he listened to the advice of a range of people, including his national security adviser John Bolton, though he didn't mention Carlson.
"I have John Bolton, who I would definitely say is a hawk, and I have other people that are on the other side of the equation," Trump said. "And ultimately, I make the decisi

Texto completo: Question: Can you tell me the approximate value of old newspapers and magazines? I have the full copy of the New York Times newspaper from April 15, 1865, with the headline "Awful Event, President Lincoln Shot by an Assassin," as well as a newspaper of Kennedy's assassination. I also have old Playboy magazines from the 1950s-'70s.
Answer: Old newspapers covering major events, like the assassinations of Lincoln and Kennedy, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby, the sinking of the Titanic, the San Francisco earthquake and other major catastrophes, sell for the highest prices.
The front page of the April 15, 1865, New York Times sold at auction for $450 last year. A copy of the same issue, with eight pages, sold for $1,200 three years ago. Most Playboy magazines sell for only a couple of dollars. A collection of 30 magazines sold for $76. But beware, many copies have been made of the famous newspapers. Old newspapers yellow and fall apart unless properly stored.
Q: I am trying to find out what my silver tray is worth. It is oval and has a rope twist rim. There is a mark on the bottom with a three-leaf stem, a crown and a standing lion over two more lions and a star. The mark also has old-English-looking letters: EBM & S.
A: The letters on your tray are actually EGW & S, which stand for E.G. Webster & Son of New York City and Brooklyn. The Elizur G. Webster firm started in New York City in 1860. In 1864, Webster partnered with William Dupree and the firm became Webster & Dupree.
After a few changes in partnerships with William Dupree and Webster's brother Adelbert Webster, E.G. partnered with his son Fred H. Webster in 1886, and the firm became E.G. Webster & Son. E.G. died in 1900. His son continued the business until 1928, when it was sold to International Silver Co. In 1981, it was sold to Oneida. Your tray is silver plate and the pattern is No. 210. The mark dates it from 1886 to 1928.
Medium-size silver-plated serving trays in good condition are worth $35 to $50.
Q: I have an antique buffet that I bought 30 years ago at an antiques shop in Florida. It has two long drawers and two cupboards with interior shelves. There is a paper label that says "Fulton Street at Hoyt, Abraham & Straus, Brooklyn" and "No. 445-1" is burned into the wood. I'd like to know more about the buffet and its value.
A: Abraham & Straus started in 1865 as Wechsler & Straus. The name became Abraham & Straus in 1893 after the Straus family bought out Weschler. It became part of Federated Department Stores in 1900. The name Abraham and Straus continued to be used until 1995.
The number is probably the model number. Your buffet was made in the first half of the 20th century. Many reproductions of earlier styles of furniture were made before 1960. A buffet would sell for about $750-$1,000 depending on style and condition.
Q: Is there any value to an old box of phonograph needles? I have an unopened tin that contains 200 needles. It says "Columbia medium tone needles" on the lid. It says "Brilliant" above that and "Use each needle once only" below. It's yellow with brown and white and has music notes on either side of the writing.
A: Tin phonograph needle cases appeal to people who collect phonographs, music memorabilia or advertising items. The tins are very small, about 2 inches across, and often have attractive graphic designs lithographed on the top and sides. Your tin is from the 1920s and sells online for about $15. The unused needles are also wanted by those who play their old records.
Tip: To get rid of smoke smell, try boiling an onion for an hour or two. Make sure there is enough water so it stays covered while boiling.

Texto completo: Solo unos días antes de que se fijara la fecha para que Adolfo González, residente de Salinas, realizara su examen de acreditación para titularse como maestro, y después de décadas de trabajo en el campo, Adolfo sostuvo en sus manos la resolución del condado de Monterey que proclama el 11 de junio como el "Día de Adolfo González".
Esto sucedió tras la muy publicitada graduación de González, a sus 58 años de edad, de la California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB).
"Como he dicho, hice esto por mi familia, por mi comunidad y también por mí", dijo. "Pero nunca imaginé que pudiera inspirar a tantas personas".
El mes pasado, se graduó anticipadamente con honores de la carrera de Lengua y Cultura Españolas, y The Salinas Californian publicó la historia sobre su logro.
Poco después, la historia de González cautivó al público en todo Estados Unidos y América Latina a través de los noticieros y las redes sociales.
¡Despierta América!, el programa matutino de Univisión para hispanohablantes en los EE. UU., lo entrevistó en directo por televisión. También habló con la Agencia EFE, la agencia noticiosa internacional más importante en español y la cuarta a nivel mundial. Además, los periódicos New York Times y Los Angeles Times presentaron en sus boletines informativos sobre California, la historia original de The Californian sobre González.
También KTLA, el segundo mercado medios digitales más importante en Estados Unidos según los índices de Nielsen, realizó reportajes sobre González. Esta estación de noticias tiene la mayor audiencia en Los Ángeles.
Su licenciatura fue la culminación de una búsqueda de décadas por continuar su educación, la cual inició cuando se mudó de su comunidad rural en México, hablando solo zapoteco, al internado, una escuela para jóvenes indígenas en la ciudad, para aprender español.
Más tarde, González se mudó al Valle de Salinas para cosechar apio y vivió durante años sin estatus legal. Pero mientras tanto, puso énfasis en la educación de su esposa y sus dos hijas.
Finalmente aprendería inglés y adquiriría la ciudadanía. Empezó tomando clases en una escuela para adultos, para después asistir a una escuela universitaria comunitaria y a la CSUMB, donde se graduó el 24 de mayo.
Los supervisores del condado de Monterey celebraron su trabajo este martes con un día en reconocimiento de González, un honor que rara vez se otorga a residentes.
"Su historia no podía haber llegado en mejor momento", dijo el supervisor Luis Alejo, quien representa a la mayoría de Salinas, ciudad donde vive González. "Estamos viviendo en una época en la que prevalecen los ataques contra los inmigrantes. Pero son estas historias las que nos recuerdan como estadounidenses lo que significa alcanzar el sueño americano".
Su hija Marie, cargando en brazos a su hija Katelyn de 3 meses de edad, dijo durante la ceremonia que sus familiares de México y Los Angeles, que cuenta con una gran población de origen zapoteco, se comunicaron para volver a estar en contacto después de años de separación.
Incluso antiguos compañeros de clase que abandonaron los estudios quieren hablar con su padre y con Marie, quien se graduó de la CSUMB un año antes que su padre. Le dicen que quieren volver a los estudios después de escuchar la historia de su familia.
"Como siempre dice mi papá, esto se ha salido de control... demasiado", expresó. "Nunca pensamos que recibiría un reconocimiento así. Siempre pensamos que solo a la familia le daría gusto y emoción. Pero parece que toda la comunidad está emocionada y se siente motivada por su logro."
González asistió inicialmente a la Salinas Adult School, a donde regresó a dar clases como voluntario. Dan Burns, superintendente del Distrito Escolar Unificado de Salinas, dijo que la historia de González se destaca en los 101 años de historia de la escuela, durante los cuales más de 20,000 adultos han asistido a clases.
Susan Landesman, especialista de programa en la escuela para adultos, conoció a González por primera vez hace más de un año, cuando él quería impartir clases ahí como parte de un requisito académico de la CSUMB.
Ella está orgullosa de la flexibilidad de la escuela y de la enseñanza gratuita, la cual permite que los adultos trabajen paso a paso en su educación, como lo hizo González.
Junto con su esposa María, sus hijas Blanca y Marie, y sus nietos Katelyn y Mateo, González se dio un tiempo el 11 de junio para agradecer a todos lo que le ayudaron en el camino. Incluso Carmen, su madre de 91 años de edad, quien vive en su pequeño pueblo zapoteco de San Andrés Yaa en México, lo ha apoyado a través de llamadas telefónicas diarias durante años.
"Estoy aquí, está bien", dijo González, "pero junto a mí, detrás de mí, hay muchas personas que han trabajado arduamente para que alcanzara mi éxito. Como dije, quisiera compartir este reconocimiento con ellos".
Kayla, la nieta mayor de González, aprendió de él a jugar ajedrez y con frecuencia estudiaba junto a su abuelo, pero no pudo asistir a la ceremonia porque estaba en clase ese día, preparándose para graduarse de sexto grado en la Monte Bella Elementary School de Salinas.
"Ella se siente orgullosa y con una profunda responsabilidad de lograr sus metas académicas", dijo Marie sobre su hija de 11 años. "Dice que quiere que su abuelo se sienta orgulloso".

TRUMP AND IRAN SEEM HEADED TOWARD A COLLISION COURSE BOTH SIDES HAVE BEHAVED RECKLESSLY AND GIVEN THEMSELVES NO FACE-SAVING ESCAPES

Texto completo: Another Middle East war is the last thing we need. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="24703">
Iran shot down an American drone on Thursday, in the latest sign that President Donald Trump and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, may be on a collision course. Both say they don't want a war but each feeds off the other, and both have behaved recklessly in ways that increase the risk of conflict.
Then yesterday, it was revealed the U.S. was ready to attack some targets in Iran in retaliation, but that Mr. Trump canceled the operation, saying it was "disproportionate."
So, whatever the outcome of this immediate crisis, we're facing very real risks of a cycle of escalation, without good face-saving exit ramps for either Mr. Trump or Ayatollah Khamenei. This could get scarier.
If the escalation continues, Iranian proxies could strike Americans in Iraq, Syria and other countries, and there is also a risk of Hezbollah firing rockets at Israel to trigger a new Israel-Lebanon war. Oil flows could be interrupted, and the global economy affected. This could get very messy.
American hard-liners have had a dangerous obsession with Iran for years, egged on by Saudi Arabia and Israel. In 2002, in the run-up to the Iraq war, Newsweek quoted a British official as saying: "Everyone wants to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran."
Mr. Trump and his aides are right that Iran is repressive, destabilizing and untrustworthy, and it shouldn't be trusted with nuclear weapons. (Of course, the same is true of Saudi Arabia under Mr. Trump's buddy, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.)
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="24711">
In 2015, President Barack Obama achieved a nuclear deal that verifiably kept Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for 15 years or more. It was an imperfect compromise, but it made Iran less worrying for years to come.
Then along came Mr. Trump, blowing up the nuclear deal and starting a campaign of "maximum pressure" on Iran's economy.
Quite predictably, Iran responded in two ways.
First, Iran warned that it would violate terms of the nuclear deal. Alarmed and flailing about, Washington this week had the gall to call on Iran to adhere to the nuclear pact that Mr. Trump has abrogated.
Second, Iran was probably behind attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. It's not impossible that Iran is being framed, but even knowledgeable Democrats believe the Trump administration is correct about Iran's responsibility.
Both the nuclear production and the attacks on tankers underscore the way Mr. Trump's retreat from diplomacy has made the world more perilous. But they both are measured provocations: If you want to damage a tanker, you put the limpet mine below the water line rather than above it, and Iran's violations of the Iran pact won't put it close to a bomb soon.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="24719">
Mr. Trump described the damage to the tankers as "very minor," and he seems to recognize the danger of escalation. But he has sent an additional 2,500 U.S. troops to the region, and there have been calls for striking Iran. If the U.S. does, then of course Iran will respond.
Brett McGurk, a national security expert and former presidential envoy, warned that given the failure of the administration's Iran policy so far, "Trump may soon be boxed in: Either back down or resort to military tools."
It's troubling that the administration is also conflating Shiite Iran with the Sunni Taliban. Members of Congress fear that this is meant to give Mr. Trump legal cover to attack Iran under the 2001 authorization for the use of military force against al-Qaida and its offshoots.
Reflecting the administration's propensity to inhabit a fantasyland, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has offered a ridiculous 12-point plan that essentially called for Iran to roll over and surrender.
I was in Paris last weekend for the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, and it's sad to see how distrustful our allies have become toward America. Instead of forcing Iran into submission, Washington's incompetent bullying of Europe and Asia to join Iran sanctions has managed to antagonize our oldest friends, push Iran back toward a nuclear path and increase the risk of war.
There are few good options now, but an international force to protect tankers might help, along with secret diplomacy to see if the nuclear deal can be patched up in a way that both sides can accept. I doubt it, but it's worth trying.
I've been to Iran, reported from Iran and been detained in Iran; I have no illusions about it. The American hard-liners are quite right that the regime is unpopular because of its corruption, incompetence and repression. But Iran also has a deep nationalist streak, and Mr. Trump already seems to be strengthening hard-liners in Tehran. In 2002, six months before the Iraq war, I reported from Baghdad that President George W. Bush and his aides were deluding themselves to think that Iraqis would welcome an invasion; Iraqis hated Saddam Hussein but hated even more the idea of Yankee imperialists attacking their nation. Iran is similar but more formidable.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="24727">
Negotiations are frustrating, imperfect and uncertain, and they may seem less satisfying than dropping bombs. But America has suffered huge self-inflicted wounds because of its invasion of Iraq 16 years ago.
Haven't we learned lessons? Maybe "real men" should forget about going to Tehran and try multilateral diplomacy.

THE LESSONS OF CHERNOBYL A COUNTRY'S SURVIVAL IN A CRISIS DEPENDS ON THE CREDIBILITY OF ITS GOVERNMENT

Texto completo: I binge-watched HBO's "Chernobyl" this week. It made me think of Donald Trump. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="256">
No, my Trump Derangement Syndrome has not spiked to 12,000 Roentgen on the ideological dosimeter. And no, I don't think of the Trump administration as an open-air nuclear-reactor fire. To watch "Chernobyl" (and read nonfictionalized accounts of the tragedy) is to be reminded that such similes should be used sparingly.
But there's one striking parallel. "Chernobyl" isn't just an account of an environmental catastrophe or the personal heroics that prevented it from becoming even worse. It illustrates what happens to societies corrupted by the institutionalization of lies and the concomitant destruction of trust.
That's the real story of the real Chernobyl, where for once the basic truths of the natural world - of chemistry and particle physics - overwhelmed the enforced truths of Soviet orthodoxy and propaganda.
In scene after scene, party officials decree that the seriousness of the accident isn't so bad. Or that the extent of the fallout isn't so wide. Or that the reach of the blame isn't so deep. They lie to the West. They lie to their people. They lie up the chain of command and down it. Why? Because they can.
"Do you think the right question will get you the truth?" Anatoly Dyatlov (played by Paul Ritter), the engineer who oversaw the safety test that led to the disaster and later became the regime's designated fall guy, says to a scientist trying to find out what happened the night of the accident. "There is no truth. Ask the bosses whatever you want and you will get the lie. And I will get the bullet."
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="262">
In fact, Dyatlov got 10 years (and served three). But the line captures the essence of a system in which every official lie is a noble one and truth is whatever happens to serve the party at a particular moment in time. And it works - until it doesn't.
"Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth," Valery Legasov (Jared Harris), the hero of the drama, says just before committing suicide. "Sooner or later that debt is paid."
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="265">
At last count - June 7 - The Washington Post had listed 10,796 false or misleading claims by Mr. Trump over 869 days. Sometimes The Post can be too fastidious, citing differences of opinion as evidence of falsehood, so let's cut the tally by half. That still comes to 5,398 false or misleading claims, which comes to 6.2 a day, or about once every three waking hours.
I asked Middlebury College's Allison Stanger, author of the exceptionally sharp forthcoming book, "Whistleblowers: Honesty in America from Washington to Trump," about the cumulative effect of this blizzard. She quoted Hannah Arendt's famous observation: "If everybody always lies to you, the consequence is not that you believe the lies, but rather that nobody believes anything any longer."
The result is that people lose the capacity to think for themselves, to make judgments, to find a rational basis for taking any sort of stand on principle. They become sheep.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="269">
On Tuesday, The New York Times' Jeremy Peters published a profile of the conservative radio host Michael Savage, an early and fervent Trump supporter who occasionally voices his disappointment with the president, always from a right-wing perspective. Many of his 7.5 million listeners don't take it too well. As Mr. Savage puts it, to "too many people" Mr. Trump is more than a human being, "he's a demigod."
Those people - the ones who brook no criticism of Mr. Trump, ever, on any subject - are the sheep.
That's not anything like a majority of the country. But it is further poisoning a society in which the idea of truth was already being Balkanized (our truth), personalized (my truth), problematized (whose truth), and trivialized (your truth) - all before Mr. Trump came along and defined truth as whatever he can get away with.
The most telling thing about The Post's count of Mr. Trump's untruths is how un-shocking it becomes as the number grows larger. Like money, lies are subject to an inflationary rule: The more there are in official circulation, the less each one matters.
All this is unfolding without the assistance of the K.G.B. or some other instrument of a repressive state to enforce a line and dissolve the distinction between fact and fiction. But the effect is no less damaging. A president who will say anything speaks to a base that will believe anything. Meanwhile, the rest of the country doesn't believe a word.
What happens when we have our own Chernobyl, or another 9/11, or something worse, and the credibility of government becomes essential to the survival of the state? What happens when the word of the president actually matters?
Watching "Chernobyl," I was left with this disquieting thought: At least the Soviet Union had Mikhail Gorbachev, with his instinctive decency and honesty, at the top during that crisis.

Texto completo: The White House announced Friday that President Trump intends to nominate Army Secretary Mark T. Esper to serve as his secretary of defense as the Pentagon faces a leadership vacuum amid a mounting confrontation with Iran.
The decision comes as lawmakers increasingly pressure the president to bring stable civilian leadership to the Pentagon, where it has been absent since Jim Mattis abruptly resigned as defense secretary late last year.
The need for a confirmed defense secretary became more pronounced Thursday, as Trump considered a military strike on Iran in retaliation for the downing of a U.S. reconnaissance drone but ultimately backed down over what he said was his concern about Iranian casualties.
Esper, after studying in the same U.S. Military Academy class as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, began a long career as an Army infantryman that included serving in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. He later became a Washington insider, honing his defense policy skills as an adviser to Republican lawmakers, a top civilian Pentagon official, a top official at a conservative think tank, a lobbyist for defense contractor Raytheon and most recently the top civilian overseeing the U.S. Army.
His deep understanding of Washington's inner workings marks a stark contrast to the background of acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan, who joined the Pentagon after decades of working in the private sector at Boeing and entered government without a military background or the long-standing relationships typical of high-level Defense Department officials.
News of Trump's intent to nominate Esper was first reported by the New York Times. The White House also announced Friday evening that Trump will nominate Army undersecretary Ryan McCarthy to replace Esper. Trump will also nominate David Norquist, the Defense Department's chief financial officer, to be the agency's deputy secretary.
Trump intended to nominate Shanahan to run the Pentagon, but the former Boeing executive withdrew from consideration this week as reports surfaced about his contentious divorce, including an incident in 2011 when his son attacked his ex-wife with a baseball bat. Shanahan's last day is Sunday.
After Shanahan bowed out, Trump tweeted that Esper would be the new acting defense secretary.
He also said Tuesday that he would "most likely" nominate Esper.
Esper, 55, served in the 101st Airborne Division during the Gulf War and later commanded an airborne rifle company in Europe, receiving the Legion of Merit and a Bronze Star, according to his official Army biography. He gained policy experience working for Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including as national security adviser to then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and as policy director for the House Armed Services Committee.
He left government and served as chief of staff at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, and then in the defense industry, first as the chief operating officer of the Aerospace Industries Association and later as vice president of government relations for the defense contractor Raytheon. He also held positions as executive vice president for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Global Intellectual Property Center and as its vice president for Europe and Eurasian affairs.

Texto completo: What can be said with certainty about the explosions that rocked two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman on Thursday is that attacks on civilian targets are reprehensible.
Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a likely culprit, and a video taken by a United States Navy surveillance plane demands an explanation. It shows what American officials say was a Revolutionary Guards patrol boat pulling up alongside the Kokuka Courageous, one of the damaged tankers, several hours after the initial explosion, and removing a mine. Iranian officials denied involvement, and the Japanese owner of the Kokuka Courageous said Friday that the tanker was struck by a flying projectile, not a mine.
So there are unanswered questions about what happened, not just on Thursday but also last month when American officials blamed Iran for similar attacks against four tankers on the same waterway, which links to the Persian Gulf and carries almost one-third of the world's petroleum.
The incident is the latest evidence that the United States and Iran are on a collision course, at a moment in which hard-liners on both sides have little interest in any diplomatic off-ramp.
After withdrawing from the 2015 agreement that restrained Iran's nuclear program in fanciful pursuit of a "better deal," President Trump embarked on a campaign of "maximum pressure" against Tehran. The United States has imposed sanctions, and more are planned, with a goal of shutting off Iran's oil exports, the country's main source of revenue.
Administration officials say this strategy is working because Iranian financing for its proxy forces like Hezbollah in Lebanon has been reduced. But Iranian leaders were never going to just capitulate to American demands, and they continue working to thwart American objectives in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere across the region.
Iran is also edging toward exceeding the limits imposed by the nuclear deal... And it may well be that the Revolutionary Guards Corps, which wields important military and economic clout in Iran and has often been at odds with the country's more pragmatic political leadership, intends to safeguard its own interests by threatening the oil transport on which the world's economy depends.
The Trump administration's lack of a coherent strategy for dealing with Iran has resulted in a series of conflicting messages, all of which contribute to a growing sense of foreboding and unpredictability.
While the president has said he wants to extricate America from foreign wars, he also ordered a carrier group into the Persian Gulf last month, and he has sometimes raised the possibility of military action.
Mr. Trump continues to rely for advice on leading hawks, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who on Thursday went beyond the tanker incidents to accuse Iran of several other attacks without offering proof.
Once American and allied intelligence agencies thoroughly investigate the tanker attacks, the data should be presented to the United Nations Security Council. It may be necessary for the United States and its partners to reflag and escort oil tankers in the Persian Gulf, as happened in 1987 and 1988, during the Iran-Iraq war.
Dialogue between the Trump administration and Iranian government would be wise, though Iran may prove unwilling to talk unless sanctions are eased and the United States rejoins the nuclear deal.
Meanwhile, attacks against civilian shipping in one of the world's most vital international waterways have to stop. Every new provocation will make it harder to avoid a new regional cataclysm.

Here’s a free tip for Democrats wanting more media attention

Texto completo: Democrats running for president seem confounded as to why they’re not getting any airtime as all 98 of them compete for the party’s nomination. But they may have figured out the secret this week. They’re going to have to differentiate themselves and that means, yes, fighting each other. Viciously, if need be.
They might have gotten a clue this week when Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., resurfaced on cable news after weeks in obscurity. We were only reminded of who he is because he pointedly attacked Joe Biden for heralding his working relationship with segregationist senators as an example of “civility.”
That should be a clue for Democrats as to how this works, but as recently as Monday, they were still bemoaning their inability to divert attention from President Trump or their competitors to themselves.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez complained to the Washington Post that Trump “has managed to control the media cycle on a daily basis in ways that have made it difficult to communicate our message.”
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that candidates complaining about scant coverage of their campaigns “reflect frustration with the new, celebrity-driven political era that Mr. Trump’s rise helped usher in.” The Times said that “established governors, senators, other elected officials and their staff frequently whine about the media attention being paid to less experienced politicians like Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose presence on cable television helped him exponentially expand his list of donors and propelled his rise in the polls.”
First, the notion that Trump in 2016 received excessive attention from the national media, which in turn gave him an unfair advantage in the crowded Republican primary field, is only held by people ignorant of how the news business works.
It’s called “earned media” for a reason. In a campaign, no less a primary campaign with two dozen candidates, you have to do something to earn people’s attention.
Here’s a free tip for them all: The No. 1 way to do that on a national level is by creating conflict. Trump did that every single day during the GOP primary, taking on each of his party rivals one by one. It’s not enough, though, to call someone a name. There has to be a point, which in news terms is called impact.
Trump famously stuck Jeb Bush with the “low energy” label, and it worked because it made it clear to GOP voters that Bush wasn’t prepared to fight for a nomination that he must have already felt was his.
In late 2015, when polls showed Ben Carson edging out Trump in Iowa, Trump took a chainsaw to the former neurosurgeon’s most precious asset — his life story — which until then had gone without scrutiny. Trump accused Carson of making up much of his gauzy autobiography and, using Carson’s own book, started referring to Carson’s “pathological temper.”
The Democrat who is prepared to do what Trump did is the one who will get the media attention to elevate his or her campaign and its message (assuming it has one). But if every Democrat is going to pretend that this isn’t a competition, and if they’re only going to say things like, “The most important thing is beating Donald Trump,” then they might as well stop complaining about being ignored.

Trump reportedly cancels attack on Iran as US planes were in the air

Texto completo: BACK FROM THE BRINK: Last night all signs pointed to an imminent U.S. military response to Iran’s shootdown of an unmanned American spy plane Thursday morning. While President Trump was cagey with reporters yesterday, suggesting that perhaps “somebody who was loose and stupid” had given the orders, he also hinted something would be happening soon.
“We'll be able to report back and you'll understand exactly what happened, but it was a very foolish move, that I can tell you,” Trump said. “This is a new wrinkle, this is a new fly in the ointment, what happened, shooting down the drone,” he said. “And this country will not stand for it, that I can tell you.”
PLANES IN THE AIR: The New York Times reported last night that after a day of consultation with his national security team and members of Congress, Trump authorized strikes against radars and missile battery targets in Iran, only to abort the mission before any bombs were dropped or missiles launched.
“The operation was underway in its early stages when it was called off,” the Times quotes a senior administration official saying. “Planes were in the air and ships were in position, but no missiles had been fired when word came to stand down, the official said.”
More from the Times report: “It was not clear whether Mr. Trump simply changed his mind on the strikes or whether the administration altered course because of logistics or strategy. It was also not clear whether the attacks might still go forward. Asked about the plans for a strike and the decision to hold back, the White House declined to comment, as did Pentagon officials. No government officials asked The New York Times to withhold the article.”
WHERE WAS THE DRONE?: A key point of dispute is whether at any point the $130-million Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone veered into Iranian airspace as it flew over the Strait of Hormuz. The Pentagon was adamant that it did not.
“This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset that had not violated Iranian airspace at any time during its mission,” said Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, commander of U.S. Air Forces Central Command, who read a statement to Pentagon reporters from his headquarters in Qatar. “Iranian reports that this aircraft was shot down over Iran are categorically false.”
Iran claims the spy drone came within 9 miles of its coast, but Guastella said it was 20 miles offshore when it was shot by an Iranaian surface-to-air missile. “The aircraft was over the Strait of Hormuz and fell into international waters.” A video posted by the Pentagon shows the smoke trail as the aircraft plunges into the sea.
Later the Pentagon released a graphic that it said depicted the exact flight path of the drone, showing it never flew over Iranian territorial waters.
IRAN STICKING TO ITS STORY: On Twitter, Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, posted his country’s depiction of the flight path, along coordinates that he said showed the plane was targeted in Iranian airspace.
“At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace. It was targeted at 04:05 at the coordinates (25°59'43"N 57°02'25"E) near Kouh-e Mobarak,” Zarif tweeted. “We've retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down.”

UNEASE IN CONGRESS: After briefings at the White House yesterday, members of Congress expressed worry that, in the words of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., the United States might “bumble” into a war with Iran that could quickly spin out of control.
“We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. “This is a dangerous situation,” she said. “We're dealing with a country that is a bad actor in the region. We have no illusions about Iran.”
It wasn’t just Democrats who were urging restraint. Even some of the president's most loyal supporters in Congress were warning against punishing retaliation that could trigger a broader conflict.
“Some response may be appropriate, but full engagement definitely is not going to get support,” Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., one of Trump’s closest allies on Capitol Hill, told the Washington Examiner.
Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., a senior member of the Foreign Relations panel, resisted the idea of any military response at all. “I think Iran needs to know that there are people that are ready to do military action, but I don’t think this justifies it,” said Yoho. “That just is the beginning of escalation. I would wait until they did something more egregious but let them know. ... Don’t do any more things like this to the United States because it’s going to lead to something you’re really not going to like.”
The strongest advocate of military force was Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “I would encourage forceful action to stop this behavior before it leads to a wider conflict. Doing nothing has its own consequence. If you do nothing, the Iranians see us as weak,” Graham said. “Here's what Iran needs to get ready for: severe pain inside their country.”
SAUDI ARMS SALE: The Senate voted yesterday to block President Trump’s Saudi arms deal, but the vote totals did not reach the two-thirds threshold needed to override the veto promised by the president.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited the threat from Iran when he notified Congress last month that Trump would exercise emergency powers to expedite the $8 billion arms package to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
The White House argues the missile attacks on Saudi Arabia from Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen and the tensions in the region make the arms deal more urgent than ever.
“To reject these sales at this time and under these circumstances is to reward recent Iranian aggression and to encourage further Iranian escalation,” said Jim Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, adding that blocking the sale would simply “encourage miscalculation on the part of Iranians, which will be disastrous.”
ESPER’S LEGAL QUANDARY: When Patrick Shanahan announced this week he was stepping down as acting defense secretary, President Trump promptly named Army Secretary Mark Esper to the post and said he would “most likely” make Esper his nominee for the permanent job. “That's what I'm thinking about doing, most likely, pretty soon,” he told reporters Monday.
But veteran Associated Press Pentagon reporter Lolita Baldor points out it’s not that simple, writing that “because of limitations laid out in court decisions and legislation governing how top level vacancies are filled, [Esper] will only be allowed to serve for about six weeks in that temporary capacity.”
“Normally, senior leaders can be ‘acting’ for 210 days, but because Shanahan was never nominated the clock on Esper started ticking on January 1, when previous Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned. That would force Esper out of the acting role by July 30,” Baldor writes. “If he is nominated, he’ll have to step down and move to another job until the Senate votes on his confirmation. And anyone chosen to fill in temporarily — even for a short time while the confirmation process goes on — will have limited authorities and won’t have all of the decision-making power that a defense secretary needs when his nation is at war in several countries and conducting major military operations in dozens of others.”
ESPER’S FIRST CHALLENGE: Esper was among the advisers who huddled with Trump at the White House yesterday as the president mulled the response to the Iran situation. And the Pentagon has announced that with Shanahan departing at midnight Sunday, Esper will represent the United States at next week’s meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
While Esper has two years of Pentagon experience under his belt, his job as Army secretary is very different from the responsibilities of defense secretary. The Army secretary is the civilian in charge of training and equipping the force so it’s ready when called upon by the commander in chief. Service secretaries play little role in policy and military strategy and are not in the chain of command. Working for Trump and implementing and defending his policies will involve a steep learning curve.
BOMBSHELL IN SEAL TRIAL: Surprise testimony in the trial of Special Warfare Chief Eddie Gallagher has thrown into question the charges that he killed a captured Islamic State fighter in Iraq in 2017.
Fellow Navy SEAL Corey Scott, who has been granted immunity, testified that he, not Gallagher, was responsible for the death of the man.
Scott said while Gallagher stabbed the fighter in the neck, the wound did not kill him. A trained combat medic, Scott said he put his thumb over a breathing tube that had been inserted into the ISIS fighter's mouth until the fighter asphyxiated.
Gallagher’s attorneys are expected to ask for a motion of acquittal based on the testimony, but prosecutors have no intention of dropping murder charges, a spokesman for the military said Thursday.
WHAT DID THE PRESIDENT KNOW?: When a U.S. aircraft is downed by hostile fire in a world hot spot, normally the president is notified immediately.
But when President Trump called into Sean Hannity’s Fox News Channel show from the White House Wednesday night, he seemed uninformed or unconcerned about the downing earlier in the evening of a sophisticated, unmanned spy plane by an Iranian surface-to-air missile.
“Don't worry about a thing. Everything is under control,” Trump said in response to a question from Hannity about how Trump planned to keep Iran from acquiring weapons.
“Would you say they never get nukes? They never get nuclear weapons?” Hannity asked.
“I would say, if I were you, don't worry about a thing,” Trump replied.
U.S. Central Command said the U.S. Navy RQ-4A Global Hawk unmanned surveillance plane was shot down at approximately 11:35 p.m. GMT Wednesday, which was 7:35 p.m. EDT, or an hour and a half before the 9 p.m. start of Hannity's show.
Trump either didn’t know about the incident or chose to keep the information to himself.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — The downing of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran was a "very big mistake," President Donald Trump said in a tweet Thursday. But as some Republicans pressed for new steps against the country, Trump played down the incident, noting that the aircraft was not carrying any Americans.
The attack on the Navy RQ-4 drone heightened fears that the U.S. and Iran are on a course toward a military conflict as each side blamed the other. The New York Times reported Thursday night that Trump approved a retaliatory strike to take place this morning but abruptly pulled back, according to senior administration officials.
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said in a statement that it targeted the drone inside Iranian airspace over the southern province of Hormozgan, next to the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
But U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, denied that the aircraft had entered Iranian airspace, characterizing the incident as an "unprovoked attack" over one of the world’s most important commercial waterways.
Trump suggested that the attack on the RQ-4 Global Hawk, which has the wingspan of a commercial airliner, may have been carried out without the knowledge of Iranian leaders.
"I’m not just talking about the country made a mistake. I’m talking about somebody under the command of that country made a mistake," Trump said at the White House alongside visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. "I find it hard to believe it was intentional" on the part of Iran’s top officials, the president said.
Trump was noncommittal about a U.S. counterattack. "Let’s see what happens," he said. "This is a new fly in the ointment — what happened, shooting down the drone — and this country will not stand for it."
The White House invited a bipartisan group of top congressional leaders to a meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss the situation. Among those invited were Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and the chairmen and ranking minority party members of the House and Senate intelligence and armed services committees.
"We had a good briefing," McConnell said, adding that he could confirm that an unmanned aerial vehicle "was fired on from Iranian soil and it was in international waters. And beyond that I think the administration is engaged in what I would call measured responses."
Schumer said he cautioned that "these conflicts have a way of escalating."
"The president may not intend to go to war here, but we’re worried that he and the administration may bumble into a war," he said. "One of the best ways to avoid bumbling into war, a war that nobody wants, is to have a robust open debate and for Congress to have a real say. We learned that lesson in the run-up to Iraq" in 2003.
After the White House meeting, Pelosi held a closed-door session with Democratic lawmakers to brief them on the developments. "We know that the high-tension wires are up there, and we must do everything we can not to escalate the situation, but also to make sure that our personnel in the region are safe," she said.
Thursday’s strike capped a number of recent incidents, including attacks on oil tankers, that American officials have depicted as part of an Iranian effort to hurt the United States and its allies in the region. The attack on the drone comes as the United States continues its "maximum pressure" campaign against a country the Trump administration has identified as its main adversary in the Middle East.
Tehran has responded with defiance to the initiative, which was launched after Trump withdrew the United States from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and has included designating the Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist group and taking steps to cut off Iranian oil sales.
On Thursday, the European Union said officials from Germany, Britain, France, Russia, China and Iran would meet next week to discuss strategies to salvage the nuclear pact despite renewed U.S. sanctions and Tehran’s threat to exceed limits on its uranium stockpiles.
The Revolutionary Guard’s top commander, Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, called the downing of the drone "a clear message to America."
"Our borders are Iran’s red line, and we will react strongly against any aggression," Salami said in remarks carried by Iranian state television. "Iran is not seeking war with any country, but we are fully prepared to defend Iran."
Nearly a quarter of the world’s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects Middle East energy producers to markets around the globe.
Lt. Gen. Joseph Guastella, head of U.S. air forces in the Middle East, told reporters at the Pentagon that the Global Hawk was flying at high altitude in the vicinity of recent tanker attacks and was not at any time closer than 21 miles to the nearest point on Iran’s coast.
Guastella said the aircraft did not leave international airspace and was brought down by an IRGC surface-to-air missile fired from an area close to Goruk, Iran. "This dangerous and escalatory attack was irresponsible and occurred in the vicinity of established air corridors between Dubai, UAE, and Muscat, Oman, possibly endangering innocent civilians," he said. Guastella did not take questions.
The Global Hawk incident occurs the week after two tankers, a Japanese and a Norwegian, were attacked in the area of the Gulf of Oman. The Trump administration has blamed Iran for both incidents, at least one of which is said to have been carried out by use of a limpet mine similar to devices previously displayed at Iranian military parades.

Texto completo: "According to an analysis by the New York Times using Harvard Law School's Environmental Regulation Rollback Tracker, which is keeping a running tally of the regulatory dismantling program, the Trump administration has so far initiated the reversal of 67 environmental laws."
The National Geographic, 5/3/19, published an extensive , detailed "A running list of how President Trump is changing environmental policy." Trump evidently denies environmental policies have any effect on the environment, the rising seas, and floods. (Michael Greshko, Laura Parker, Barian Clark Howard, Daniel Stone, Alejandra Borunda)
EcoWatch reports that "Louisiana Faces Faster Levels of Sea-Level Rise Than Any Other Land on Earth," 1/4/17. This prediction was given by the Louisiana Costal Protection and Restoration Authority. They state "Between 1832 and 2010 coast lost more than 1,800 square miles of land. From 2004 through 2098 alone more than 300 square miles of marsh lands were lost."
"A report by Climate Central and Zillow says that more than 386,000 existing homes in U.S. coastal areas are likely to be at risk of permanent inundation from sea level rise." (The Street Staff, "These U.S. Cities Are the Most at Risk From Rising Seas," 1/22/19)
Nigel Chiwaya reports in Mach, 1/10/18, "Along the East Coast, rainy days, high tides and sea rise make floods a part of life." Chawaya states "From 1900 to 2017, sea levels rose about a foot and a half along the Chesapeake Bay," and "all say it will get worse."
I am appalled that we have voted a president over our great country that has no appreciation for the environment and will allow the oceans to continue to rise without any controls on the environment. Trump needs to be out of office.

Texto completo: What's Streaming
MR. IGLESIAS Stream on Netflix. "You're always right! You're worse than my ex!" Gabriel Iglesias's high school teacher character says that during the first episode of this new series -- and he's talking to one of his students. Iglesias, the comedian and actor whose most recent comedy special, "One Show Fits All," debuted on Netflix earlier this year, stars in the lighthearted comedy show. He plays a teacher who takes students under his wing and helps them survive in a high school with a malevolent assistant principal (Oscar Nunez). The actress and comic Sherri Shepherd plays the school's principal.
TOY STORY (1995) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The release this weekend of "Toy Story 4" is bound to further antiquate this original entry, which was introduced to a large number of families by way of VHS tape. But there's a reason this movie turned Pixar into a filmmaking juggernaut. When it hit theaters the mid-90s, Janet Maslin, in her review for The New York Times, called it "a parent-tickling delight." And its expressive, animated toy stars -- the bendy cowboy sheriff Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) and the shiny spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) -- were unlike anything people had seen before. "Woody did this thing with his eyes," Pixar's chief creative officer, Pete Docter, recalled in a recent interview with The New York Times, "which was nothing I'd ever seen in hand-drawn animation. The subtlety of these little eye-darts that were very indicative of an inner life, these thoughts racing through Woody's head. Everybody's hair stood up. You know, oh my gosh, this is a new discovery."
What's on TV
WILDLIFE (2018) 5:45 p.m. on Showtime. Set in a stylishly imagined Great Falls, Mont., in the 1960s, this directorial debut from Paul Dano revolves around a family: Jeanette (Carey Mulligan), Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), and their teenage son, Joe (Ed Oxenbould). After Jerry loses his job, he decides for reasons left partly unknown to take a job as a firefighter in the nearby mountains. This requires him to be gone for a chunk of time. His absence becomes the story's backdrop, as Joe and Jeanette deal the change in their own ways. "The entire cast does exceptional work (Oxenbould is an exciting find), but the movie is anchored by Mulligan, who gives the best performance of any I've seen in film this year," Glenn Kenny wrote in his review in The Times last year. "Dano's direction is meticulous in every respect," he added, "which enables him to keep the characters at a remove that is both cleareyed and compassionate."
THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE: SPONGE OUT OF WATER (2015) 7:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. Save for the touring production of the "SpongeBob Musical," this hybrid animated and live-action SpongeBob SquarePants tale is the closest you'll get to seeing the famous sponge-person in the flesh.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
What is it like to have been a Marine in Afghanistan and returned there as a journalist? That's a question I get asked a lot.
I never really have an answer.
The 20-year-old and 22-year-old versions of myself who deployed to Helmand Province in 2008 and 2009 as an enlisted Marine infantryman were just that, different versions. A decade later, what's left of them are two old journals and an entry left behind from my first deployment that I recall quite often.
"I think it's the end of Day 20 out here," I wrote in early May 2008. "It's hard to explain this place, and I feel it's going to take the rest of my life to figure out what happened here."
It has been 11 years since I wrote that passage, and it's still just as true. Granted I figured out what happened in Helmand Province in 2008. It was the first chapter in a misguided counterinsurgency strategy built atop the constellation of outposts that the American military eventually handed to the Afghans in 2014. We watched them collapse under the Taliban in the months that followed.
But this month I walked out the back of a helicopter after it landed at a dusty American Special Forces outpost in eastern Nangarhar Province. The war hadn't ended, just those earlier chapters from my 20s.
The gravel felt familiar. The drone of the generators sounded familiar. The discarded burning trash on the small base's periphery smelled like the place I once called home for nearly two years.
I was back in some estranged corner of "my war" to report on the American military's war against the Islamic State affiliate in the country. At this small base, called Mission Support Site Jones, a Special Forces team and a consortium of other soldiers were trying to keep the extremists relegated to the mountains along the Pakistani border.
It was a strange thing, coming back to a place that seemed stuck in time, ripped from an earlier version of my life. But they had Wi-Fi -- we certainly didn't have that in 2008.
At dusk, I kept expecting to bump into friends from my platoon: Jorge, Ryan and Matt shuffling back from the PVC pipes half buried in the ground that doubled as urinals; their outlines distinctly recognizable after so many days in the field.
But my friends are long gone. Jorge is a police officer outside Houston. Ryan works construction in Northern California. And Matt is dead. In their place were three random soldiers -- 20-somethings who eyed me with suspicion. Just as we used to do when a reporter showed up in Helmand with unclear intentions from an outlet we had never heard of or cared to follow: Reuters? BBC? What does NPR stand for?
Early the next morning I climbed up into one of the watchtowers on the southern corner of the base. The sentry had just started his six-hour shift. He didn't say much and I stared at the mountains in the distance.
A decade ago that would have been me. Easing back on a chair of makeshift sandbags and deciding what I wanted to think about for the next half-dozen hours or so. Sifting through a shelf of memories, my brain then mostly filled with remnants of high school and the 10 days of leave before we deployed.
"You were probably told to avoid talking to me," I said to the soldier leaning on the tower's machine gun.
It was a rhetorical assertion, but my nostalgia had been replaced with the slow realization that I was currently employed by The New York Times and not the United States Marine Corps.
The soldier acknowledged the question and said little else, other than that his platoon sergeant had very much reinforced that point before my arrival.
"It's like every war movie you've ever seen but it doesn't end in 120 minutes," I wrote in 2008. "It's on loop."

Texto completo: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign was forced into a defensive posture this week after he invoked his work with Southern segregationist senators to make a point about bygone comity in Congress. The backlash has posed an early and important stress test on Mr. Biden's hold on a constituency that has helped elevate him to his front-runner perch in the polls: African-Americans.
Mr. Biden's nostalgic recollections of working with senators with whom he vehemently disagreed -- "at least there was some civility," Mr. Biden recalled -- stirred immediate condemnation from his rivals on Wednesday, including the two black candidates in the 2020 race. Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker both questioned Mr. Biden's grasp on the painful history of segregation, and Mr. Booker called on him to apologize.
The former vice president struck back. "Apologize for what," he said outside a fund-raiser on Wednesday night, in turn calling for Mr. Booker to apologize.
The episode was the most frontal confrontation yet of the presidential primary for Mr. Biden. It came one week out from the first debate and ahead of this weekend's high-profile gathering of candidates in South Carolina, a state where black voters make up a large segment of the Democratic electorate. Most of the 2020 field -- including Mr. Biden, Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris -- will attend an annual fish fry on Friday hosted by the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, Representative James E. Clyburn, and then the South Carolina Democratic Party's convention over the weekend.
[Read about how Joe Biden reached out to Cory Booker in a conciliatory phone call.]
"The vice president has a deep well of support here and it's real," said Stephen Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, S.C., who is black. "It is real," he added. "But it is not permanent. The other candidates are here and they're working hard."
But Mr. Biden and the segregationist senators were not always in disagreement. Letters provided to The New York Times by the University of Mississippi show that Mr. Biden wrote one of the men, Senator James O. Eastland of Mississippi, in 1977 to make the case for a bill limiting the transportation of students to nearby school districts to counteract segregation, a practice known as busing.
In a subsequent letter, Mr. Biden wrote, "I want you to know that I very much appreciate your help during this week's Committee meeting in attempting to bring my anti-busing legislation to a vote."
The flap over Mr. Biden's working relationship with segregationists amounted to the second self-started controversy this month for Mr. Biden. Two weeks ago he defended and then reversed his long-held position that federal funds should not go to support abortions.
The twin episodes involving race and abortion -- two of the most controversial issues in American politics -- raised questions about whether Mr. Biden is sufficiently sensitive to the trip wires of a modern Democratic Party whose ideological shape bears little resemblance to the one to which he first was elected as a senator more than four decades ago.
For Mr. Biden, the risk is that it affects his standing with black voters, who are seen as crucial to his pathway to the presidency. Polls have regularly shown Mr. Biden performing strongest among African-American voters -- popularity established following his two terms as vice president alongside the country's first black president, Barack Obama. The question is how durable that support is.
An Economist/YouGov poll earlier this month showed Mr. Biden as the overwhelming choice of black voters, with 50 percent support. In the same poll he was second among white Democrats, narrowly trailing Senator Elizabeth Warren.

Another recent poll from the Black Economic Alliance showed that Mr. Biden had, by far, the largest share of black Democrats who said they would be "enthusiastic" about his candidacy, even compared with Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker.
But Cornell Belcher, a former pollster for Mr. Obama, warned that Mr. Biden's current "support is wider than it is thick" in the black community and endangered by episodes like this week's back-and-forth, which showed a "disconnect from the community."
"There's not a lot of long-term substance behind it. He has to build roots in it of his own," Mr. Belcher said of Mr. Biden.
Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, whose group commissioned a poll in May showing Mr. Biden leading among black voters of all ages, said that Mr. Biden's connection to Mr. Obama had led to his current popularity. (Mr. Biden had 45 percent support over all in that survey with an overwhelming 66 percent support among black voters 65 and over.)
Ms. Shropshire added that "the potential for him to lose support as black voters learn about his record, and positions he has taken in the past, is very real." She ticked through Mr. Biden's stance on busing, the 1994 crime bill and his handling of Anita Hill's appearance before Congress a quarter-century ago.
The reaction to Mr. Biden's comments Tuesday at a New York fund-raiser, where he cited his ability to work with Mr. Eastland and another segregationist senator, Herman E. Talmadge of Georgia -- "he never called me 'boy', he always called me 'son,"' Mr. Biden said of Mr. Eastland -- appeared more personal than policy-driven.
[18 Questions. 21 Democrats. Here's What They Said.]
"As a black man in America, I know the deeply harmful and hurtful usage of the word 'boy' and how it was used to dehumanize and degrade," Mr. Booker said on CNN Wednesday night, adding, "Vice President Biden shouldn't need this lesson."
As for Mr. Biden's call that he should apologize, Mr. Booker said: "He knows better. And at a time when Donald Trump never apologizes for anything, he's better than this."
Senator Bernie Sanders voiced support for Mr. Booker, as did Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the influential freshman from New York, who wrote on Twitter that "it's important to realize that we can't risk depressed turnout in 2020."
The whole incident also served to highlight that Mr. Biden, 76, has been around Washington long enough to have served with open Democratic segregationists.
Mr. Biden's advisers argued that his story of working with segregationists was both not new and taken out of context. Symone Sanders, one of Mr. Biden's top African-American advisers, wrote on Twitter that critics accusing Mr. Biden of praising a segregationist were "disingenuous."
"I think we are spending a lot of time on two sentences and ignoring more than two decades of very real service advancing and advocating the cause of civil rights in our country," said Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat who is close to Mr. Biden.
Representative Cedric Richmond, a national co-chairman of Mr. Biden's campaign and former leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, brushed aside calls for an apology from Mr. Biden on this and other matters in his record. "With a 40-plus-year track record, how long do you want him to live in the past?" Mr. Richmond asked.
Mr. Richmond pointed out that many Democrats "worked with Donald Trump just last year to pass criminal justice reform, and Donald Trump has the same type of issues."
"We work with people we don't like all the time to get things accomplished," he said.
Mr. Biden has made his get-along-with-everyone pitch a part of his argument that he would be the strongest general election candidate against Mr. Trump, promising that he could uniquely restore some of the nation's lost civility of recent years.
In selling his electability, Mr. Biden has focused in particular on his ability to win back working-class white voters who defected to Mr. Trump in Midwestern swing states in 2016. Pointedly, Mr. Biden's first event as a presidential candidate and his formal kickoff speech were both in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Belcher said the short-term risk for Mr. Biden is sapping support from black voters in the primary. But the bigger, longer-term risk for Democrats is that Mr. Biden becomes the nominee and black and younger voters would stay home in the general election.
"It's fair for some Democrats to step back and wonder is Joe Biden Hillary Clinton 2.0," Mr. Belcher said, "and wonder if we're going to run into the same problem in that he's going to struggle the same way Hilary did with younger voters of color."

Texto completo: Joy Harjo started writing as a college student in New Mexico in the early 1970s, during what she described as "the beginning of a multicultural literary movement."
At gatherings around the Southwest, she began meeting poets, including Native American ones. Hearing them perform made her realize that poetry was available to everyone, including her. "It became a way to speak about especially Native women's experiences at a time of great social change," she said.
Since then Harjo, 68, has written eight books of poetry, a memoir and two books for young audiences. Now the Library of Congress has named her America's new poet laureate. She will take over for Tracy K. Smith, who has held the position for two years, and joins the ranks of such acclaimed writers as Rita Dove, Louise Glück, Billy Collins and Juan Felipe Herrera. Harjo, a member of the Muscogee Creek Nation, is the 23rd poet and first Native person to be selected for the role.
"I'm still in a little bit of shock," said Harjo, who now lives in Oklahoma, where she was born. "This kind of award honors the place of Native people in this country, the place of Native people's poetry."
[ Read "Fall Song" by Joy Harjo. ]
Rob Casper, who heads the Poetry and Literature Center at the Library of Congress, which houses the laureate, praised the "great humanity" of Harjo's poetry. "She can have a kind of great sweeping vision and still speak so directly as one human being to another in a way that I can't help but feel completely moved by and believe in," he said.
In a statement, Carla Hayden, the librarian of Congress, said Harjo's work "powerfully connects us to the earth and the spiritual world with direct, inventive lyricism that helps us reimagine who we are."
Harjo grew up on Native land in Tulsa, the eldest of four children. "I was told that I was the shyest kid at Indian school, and I liked painting, because I didn't have to speak," she said. She did not grow up around many books, but she did hear many stories, primarily about her ancestors, including tribal chiefs who were among her father's people. She grew up seeing her grandmother's artwork in their home.
In her 2012 memoir, "Crazy Brave," Harjo recounts a difficult childhood that included substance abuse, an abusive stepfather and the challenge of becoming a teenage mother, but when asked about it now, she merely said: "We are flawed human beings, and yet there was love. I made it through. We all did."
She attended a performing-arts high school, then studied painting at the University of New Mexico. She later attended the Iowa Writers' Workshop and has since published volumes of poetry that explore the connection between spirituality, nature and womanhood, with a focus on Native American history and experience.
"My poems are about confronting the kind of society that would diminish Native people, disappear us from the story of this country," she said.
She has won the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, and her newest collection, "An American Sunrise," will be published by W.W. Norton in August.
Harjo hasn't decided exactly what she will do during her time as poet laureate -- appointees usually choose a focus or project to carry out during their tenure -- but said she hoped "to remind people that poetry belongs to everyone" and that it can draw from a range of human and natural experiences, "sunrise, sunset, eating, enjoying company, births, death, all of it."
She is also a musician who has released four albums and said she wanted to highlight the intersectional nature of poetry with music and dance, as well as to speak to the present social and political divides.
"Just as when I started writing poetry, we're at a very crucial time in American history and in planetary history," Harjo said. "Poetry is a way to bridge, to make bridges from one country to another, one person to another, one time to another."

New lawsuit says NRA’s second-in-command also behind attempted coup against Wayne LaPierre

Texto completo: A new lawsuit from the National Rifle Association alleges that Chris Cox, the group’s second-in-command, was part of former NRA President Oliver North’s effort to oust chief executive Wayne LaPierre.
The lawsuit, filed late Wednesday night, alleges that text messages and emails found that “another errant NRA fiduciary, Chris Cox — once thought by some to be a likely successor for Mr. LaPierre — participated” in what the gun-advocacy group described as a conspiracy.
Cox, 49, has worked with the NRA since 1995 and has led its lobbying efforts since 2002. He is a prominent figure within the association and the revelations will doubtless send a shock through the more than 5 million members of the group, according to the New York Times.
Cox, whose Twitter banner features a picture of him and the 69-year-old LaPierre on stage next to President Trump, denied the accusations in a Thursday statement.
“The allegations against me are offensive and patently false. For over 24 years I have been a loyal and effective leader in this organization,” Cox said. “My efforts have always been focused on serving the members of the National Rifle Association, and I will continue to focus all of my energy on carrying out our core mission of defending the Second Amendment.”
LaPierre, who has served as CEO since 1991, accused North of threatening to blackmail him in April. North threatened, through public relations firm Ackerman McQueen, to release damning information on LaPierre unless he stepped aside, LaPierre said. North soon left his role as president of the organization after the attempted coup was revealed.

Three reasons Trump-Russia hasn’t turned into Watergate

Texto completo: Why haven’t efforts to impeach President Trump gained Watergate-style momentum? The lack of energy has created a sense of bafflement and disappointment among some of the president’s most determined adversaries. But there are some simple reasons for it. Here are three: 1. The facts are different. In Watergate, the underlying crime was a break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters, perpetrated by burglars paid by President Nixon’s re-election campaign. The scandal proceeded from there. In Trump-Russia, the underlying crime was the hacking of the DNC’s and John Podesta’s emails — a crime committed by Russians in Russia. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who indicted a number of Russians and Russian entities for their actions, spent two years trying to find conspiracy or coordination between the Russians and the Trump campaign. He failed.
That single fact has shaped every other aspect of the Trump-Russia affair. In Watergate, the cover-up flowed from Nixon’s desire to conceal his campaign’s involvement in the break-in and other political dark acts. It formed the bulk of the obstruction of justice case against Nixon, which in turn served as the basis for articles of impeachment.
2. The press is different. Just as the facts of Trump-Russia are quite unlike Watergate, so the media environment of 2019 is quite unlike what existed in 1974. Back then, there were three 30-minute broadcast network newscasts: CBS, NBC and ABC. There were two big newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post, and TV network executives sat down each day, within a few blocks of each other in Manhattan, to produce newscasts that basically illustrated the papers’ latest stories. There was no internet, no cable news, no podcasts, no social media and no talk radio. Nixon, even if he had had strong defenses, faced a solid wall of media opposition.
Today, the situation is much, much different — and infinitely better. There is far more diversity of opinion in the media writ large, and, importantly, popular access to primary sources. That troubles some media figures who miss the old days of news monopoly.
"During the Watergate era ... there were three networks," Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote recently. "Back then, what was said on those three networks ... was largely believed. Much more than now, there was a shared set of facts."
But it was a limited set of facts — just the ones selected by those network producers in Manhattan. Today’s media diversity, in terms of the Trump-Russia affair, means more facts see the light. And people inclined to support the president, or just be skeptical of the government’s investigative targeting of the Trump campaign, have a way to make their case beyond what anyone had 40-plus years ago.
3. Congress is different. Differences in the facts of the cases and differences in the media’s ability to report those facts have had a profound effect on lawmakers. They’re better informed, if they want to be, and can make a better defense of the president of their party. And having a significant number of constituents supporting the president makes representatives more likely to support him, too. (Unlike today, in 1974 opposition party Democrats controlled all of Congress, with 243 seats in the House and 56 in the Senate.) So this is a new world. It is perhaps not surprising to hear Democrats wish they could somehow turn today’s Trump-Russia affair into yesterday’s Watergate. If they could just hold televised hearings, they say, that could capture the nation’s attention and give Trump-Russia a Watergate-like urgency. Americans would turn against the president by the millions.
Others believe they just need time. It took Watergate years to grow big enough to oust Nixon, they say. But look at the numbers. The break-in was in June 1972, and Nixon resigned in August 1974 — a period of two years and two months. In Trump-Russia, the FBI began its investigation nearly three years ago, in July 2016. The Senate began investigating in January 2017. And Mueller took office in May 2017. It’s been a long time.
Trump-Russia could go longer still, and it would not change the basic facts of the case. It is simply a different case in a different world. Try as they might, the president’s opponents can’t make it 1974 again.

Texto completo: Del Taco will begin serving meat-free Beyond Burritos on Thursday, June 20, two months after the successful launch of its Beyond Tacos.
The new burritos expand Del Taco’s partnership with Beyond Meat, a Los Angeles-based company out to revolutionize meat substitutes with plant-based products that look and taste like beef.
The two new menu items are:
Beyond 8 Layer Burrito: Made with seasoned plant-based crumbles, slow-cooked beans, guacamole, diced tomatoes, lettuce, cheddar cheese, sauce and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla.
Epic Beyond Cali Burrito: Beyond Meat plant-based crumbles wrapped with crinkle-cut french fries, sour cream, guacamole and handmade pico de gallo in a flour tortilla.
The two Beyond Tacos on the menu are among Del Taco’s most successful launches. It has sold about 2 million of them since they were added to the menu in mid-April, according to a news release from the Lake Forest-based chain.
Plant-based protein is a hot trend in fast food and fast casual restaurants. Beyond Meat and its main competitor, Impossible Foods, have an expanding list of partners serving their products in burgers, Mexican foods and pizzas. The New York Times reported this week that Red Robin and White Castle are struggling to keep up with demand for Impossible Burgers.
Peas are a key ingredient in the Beyond Burger, while the Impossible Burger is made with soy, but both products are engineered to grill and even bleed like real beef.
Burger King began testing an Impossible Whopper in St. Louis on April 1 and three weeks later announced it would roll out the burger to the entire chain. Bay Area restaurants began serving it last week.

Texto completo: Sen. Marco Rubio criticized a New York Times reporter for saying it was "very strange" for the Florida senator to be enjoying President Trump's reelection announcement.
"In an unprecedented move a Republican Senator attended a rally in his home state in support of the re-election of a Republican President," Rubio said Tuesday on Twitter. "As opposed to smiling & chuckling at a rally for a radical liberal candidate for President who will undo policies to confront China,reduce regulations & taxes,defend liberty in Venezuela & protect the unborn?"TweetTweet"BTW, this is the same reporter who in 2015 after 3 weeks of meticulous investigative journalism uncovered that my wife had traffic tickets,I had a fishing boat & my home has big windows. And in 2016 he broke the story that I had some boots with higher heel," Rubio added.TweetMichael Barbaro, a reporter for the New York Times, said he thought it was odd that Rubio, who had been critical of Trump during the 2016 election, was now enjoying being at the president's rally.
"Very strange, for those of who covered 2016 campaign, to see Sen Marco Rubio smiling and chuckling in this audience," Barbaro said Tuesday on Twitter.TweetDuring the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Trump and Rubio engaged in personal attacks including Rubio saying Trump had a spray tan and small hands.
Barbaro, the host of the podcast "The Daily," divorced his husband last year and is now dating the podcast's producer Lisa Tobin.

Rep. Swalwell promises to fire Jared Kushner

Texto completo: Rep. Eric Swalwell said that, if elected, he will fire President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner on his first day to help with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"Israel is a country that needs to work with the Palestinian people to find a two-state solution," Swalwell told the New York Times.
"I support putting the U.S. back into the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. I support increasing aid to the Palestinian people, and I’m going to fire Jared Kushner on day one, because he has no business being on the job of seeking a two-state solution or finding peace in the Middle East. It requires serious scholars and a serious leader committed to making it happen," he said.
Swalwell, whose campaign is largely centered on gun control, also said he does not want to see any more Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Among his many responsibilities, Kushner was tapped by Trump to solve the decades-long problem between Israel and its neighbors.
Kushner visited Israel in May to set the stage for a rollout of his peace plan at an economic workshop in Bahrain later this month. Representatives of Palestine, China, and Russia, however, are not attending the event.
Regarding the ability of the Palestinians to govern themselves, Kushner said, "The hope is, is that over time, they can become capable of governing."

Texto completo: This presidency is national mistake
As a long time subscriber and occasional contributor, I wholeheartedly agree with your editorial, "Our endorsement for president in 2020: Not Donald Trump." And the timing was perfect. What I might have added is a stronger call-out to Republicans to have a respectable candidate "primary" the president.
Now that you have kicked the hornets' nest, expect an avalanche of mocking insults, to be labeled a "Trump hater," referred to as a fake news outlet, have your patriotism questioned, be accused of treason, be named as an enemy of the people and receive calls to be locked up. And that is the price you pay for speaking truth to Trump.
Prior to the 2016 election I had made the prediction the no one in their right mind would vote for Trump. On the morning after the election there were 62 million people proving me wrong. But, after two-and-a-half years of the Trump Administration I have come to believe I was more right than wrong. Tuesday's editorial list many of the reasons why history should view this presidency as America's biggest and costliest mistake in a generation.
Bill LaneOrlando
Trump has to go
I appreciate your non-endorsement of Trump in 2020 for all the reasons you listed plus a few more. He could not pass a credit check to get a job as a bank teller, let alone work for the FBI, CIA or Secret Service. He tweets foreign policy. He announced "mass arrests" of immigrants just yesterday. Any time you hear the term "mass arrests," watch out. Now, after leaving the Iran nuclear deal and threatening to stop all their oil exports, he is cueing up a military response to an "unprovoked" attack on oil tankers. With him in office, I am embarrassed to be an American. He has to go. Impeach, indict, arrest and imprison.
Phil DunkleOrlando
People care about Trump's policies
The Sentinel chooses to focus on a list by the New York Times (caught engaging in lies and leaks recently) instead of the accomplishments, achievements and restoration of this nation under President Trump.
The Sentinel chooses to assign responsibility for the chaos on President Trump instead of the rabid hard-core leftist Democrats and their projection, even clownish behavior at the State of the Union addresses?
All in all - you have your numbers, actors and wires crossed.
Thankfully, President Trump doesn't need the endorsement of this newspaper to win this election - his record and actions will do that.
The American people care about policies - particularly national security, solvency, sovereignty, stability, sanity and not parties, social, political theories and ideologies. That will win the election for President Trump.
Georgia SmithTallahassee
Leaving Trump behind
On Monday, when we learned that Trump was coming to Orlando, we cut our six-day visit to Disney World short by one day and "got out of Dodge." The first thing we read over our morning coffee was that the Sentinel endorsed "any" Democrat over Trump. The first thought we had was for "the stable genius'" beloved "poorly educated" base who would be in a profound state of shock. But for our country - indeed, for our world - I, a former Republican until July 2018, wish to thank you for your integrity and good sense. Let's hope my former party comes to its senses too and that our next president will make America sane again.
Bob CanningPetaluma, Calif.
Same old Trump hate from Sentinel
OK, I admit you got me. I looked at the front page (June 18) and saw the INSIDE summary. Under EDITORIAL: "After 2 1/2 years, we've seen enough of the chaos, the division, the schoolyard insults, the self-aggrandizement, the corruption, and especially the lies."
I said to myself, "Hurrah, they are finally going to write about Obama and Clinton." I quickly turned to the editorial page to find it was just more Hate Trump. Another disappointing Sentinel edition.
Richard HardmanOrlando
Non-endorsement reflects high values
The article that was in the paper today about not endorsing Donald Trump for president made my day. We are so happy the paper we read every day has higher values for a president that far exceed Donald Trump. Wish everybody did. Thank you.
Carl GiampapaClermont
Thank you from silent majority
Thank you. It is time for the silent majority to stand up and save America. I am proud of America. I am not a bigot. Truth, honesty, and integrity are values that are important to me. I am not a bully. As a child, I was raised to try to do the right thing and I taught my children the same. There are times that I struggle to accept those that are different than me but my goal is to achieve acceptance not indifference. History will look back unfavorably at the Trump era. It will point fingers at Mitch McConnell for his destruction of the Republican Party. Damage control will take years.
Thank you, Sentinel, for standing up for the rest of us.
Dann HerrinBelleview
Trump's record speaks for itself
Wow, we always knew the Slantinel was a biased useless excuse for a newspaper, now you've taken the baton and beaten even MSNBC with it while you run away with the race. A year and a half out and you're telling us who you're not endorsing in the election? Really? You shouldn't be commenting on it at all this far out, even though we all know you think it, shut up about it and wait till there's a Democrat nominee and a few debates under our proverbial belts. You may not like the guy, most of us don't, but even you can't ignore what's happening with the economy during his term in office. Just look outside your building, where there are cranes in every direction. We've had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years;lowest unemployment for minorities in history. Trade agreements renegotiated; 500,000 manufacturing jobs added. The accomplishments are pages deep, all that in just two-and-a-half years.
Does he lie? Of course, but tell me what politician, including every modern-day president doesn't, he's just not as subtle about it. He says what he's going to do and delivers, despite being the most hated person in this country with every major news organization bombarding us daily with negativity towards him - yes, especially the Orlando Sentinel - he's gotten more done in two-and-a-half years than Obama, the media darling, did in his entire eight-year tenure.
So here's my retort to you, as a registered independent, he's got my vote for 2020, unless of course the Democrats can put out a candidate who's impressive enough to gain my vote, but we won't know that for another year. Anyone with half a brain in their head after reading this non-endorsement will vote for him just out of spite over your obvious bias. Ridiculous!
David Gabbai Winter Park
High hopes for Trump dashed
Very well done article outlining so many reasons why Trump should not be elected for another term. I did not vote for him in 2016, but still hoped he might bring inspiring new direction within our nation's government and build on his base. He did the opposite, and the division within our country is palpable. I am tired of his daily tweets and tirades. We need to move on.

Trump Won't Retreat on His Central Park Five Comments

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
President Trump said on Tuesday that he would not apologize for his harsh comments in 1989 about the Central Park Five, the five black and Latino men who as teenagers were wrongly convicted of the brutal rape of a jogger in New York City.
Mr. Trump was asked about newspaper advertisements he bought back then calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty after the attack. (The ads never explicitly called for the death penalty for the five defendants.)
"You have people on both sides of that," he said at the White House. "They admitted their guilt."
"If you look at Linda Fairstein and if you look at some of the prosecutors, they think that the city never should have settled that case -- so we'll leave it at that," he added, referring to the former prosecutor who was running the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit at the time.
Mr. Trump's remarks about the Central Park Five were strikingly similar to comments he made in reaction to the deadly violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. A woman was killed after a driver slammed his vehicle into counterprotesters. At the time, the president said, "There was blame on both sides."
In 1989, Mr. Trump placed full-page advertisements in four New York City newspapers, including The New York Times, calling for the state to adopt the death penalty for killers. He made clear that he was voicing this opinion because of the rape and assault of Trisha Meili, a woman who had been jogging in Central Park.
"I want to hate these murderers and I always will," Mr. Trump wrote in the May 1989 ad. "I am not looking to psychoanalyze or understand them, I am looking to punish them."
He wrote in all caps: "Bring back the death penalty and bring back our police!"
At the time, Mr. Trump was an up-and-coming real estate developer, but the advertisements attracted widespread attention.
The five teenagers were wrongfully convicted and sentenced to prison for gang-raping and nearly killing Ms. Meili.
They said the police had coerced them into confessing to a crime they did not commit. Their convictions were vacated in 2002, and the city paid $ 41 million in 2014 to settle their civil rights lawsuit.
Barry Scheck, a founder of the nonprofit Innocence Project who was part of a team of lawyers who worked with prosecutors to reinvestigate the Central Park Five case, called Mr. Trump's response disturbing.
"It's shocking and deeply troubling that after all of these years, he would not have recognized that by calling for the reinstitution of the death penalty, it contributed to an atmosphere that deprived these men of a fair trial," Mr. Scheck said.
The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., said in a statement on Tuesday that the men "were wrongfully convicted and what happened to them was an injustice."
A Netflix mini-series, "When They See Us," which premiered this month, renewed focus on the case and generated public outrage.
Much of that outrage targeted Ms. Fairstein, the former prosecutor. She has resigned from a number of prominent boards, including that of Vassar College, her alma mater.
The lead prosecutor on the 1989 case, Elizabeth Lederer, resigned this month as a lecturer at Columbia Law School.
The Netflix series is a dramatized account based on the experiences of the men -- Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray and Yusef Salaam -- who spent years in prison before being cleared of the charges.
The district attorney's office determined that the attack on Ms. Meili was an assault committed by a man named Matias Reyes, who surfaced in 2002 and confessed to the crime, an admission confirmed by DNA evidence.
He had been accused of raping, maiming and murdering on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Ms. Meili was the second woman he raped and beat in the park that week.
The five boys were elsewhere in the park at the time, an investigation by the district attorney's office found in 2002.

Texto completo: I love a long hold.
If you come to my yoga class, you will either love holding postures longer than you expected, or curse me out afterward, in the kindest way possible. It’s OK, I can take it. It happens all the time.
We’ll get into a reverse warrior and hold it. And hold it. And then hold it some more. And then a half moon pose. And we’ll hold that, too, for maybe five full rounds of breath, which averages to about 30 seconds. It might not sound like a long time, but trust me when I tell you that balancing all of your weight on one leg, while tipped on your side, will make your body talk to you.
Patanjali, the Indian sage said to be the author of the Yoga Sutra, the go-to source for yoga, wrote in sutra (which can be translated to mean rule) 1.2: Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind.
I find this to be 100% true. It’s what attracted me to the practice of yoga in the first place all those years ago, when I gingerly unrolled my mat in the crowded exercise room at the gym, feeling like a flight risk, ready to flee if anybody looked at me funny.
From across the gym, that Sunday morning yoga class looked like an oasis of escape in the aftermath of a breakup. Though I wasn’t particularly broken up, it still occupied my thoughts. My intuition said, “Go to that class.” And I listened. It was one of the best choices I’ve ever made. Maybe for the first time ever, my looping, negative, anxious thoughts ceased to exist for 60 minutes. What a godsend.
How could I think about anything when I was trying to contort my body into these unusual shapes and hold them? I couldn’t. That’s the beauty of yoga. You can get out of your own dang mind for awhile. We all can benefit from regularly escaping the crazy train of our thoughts, even if only for an hour.
Nowadays, I find that similar relief while holding a posture, breathing and exploring the stillness. I still practice fast-moving vinyasa flow yoga classes, where you move into and out of postures at lightning speed and often don’t hold them long enough to attain your alignment, let alone any exploration of self. You’re in, you’re out and you’re onto the next thing. And therein lies the problem. In, out and on to the next. Isn’t that a metaphor for our lives in general?
We rush from here to there to everywhere and don’t stop for even a minute to take a few deep breaths and soak it all up. We don’t like to be still and quiet. I wrote about this recently regarding our phones and the way they’ve become an appendage. We turn to them when an empty moment looms like the Loch Ness Monster. Goodness forbid we should simply sit and do nothing and be quiet. That’s what I’m asking students to do when they hold a posture. It’s good practice for your life off the yoga mat. And I think the rewards are worth it.
A lot of people come to yoga for the physical benefits, such as improved strength and flexibility. Thirty seconds in downward facing dog with one leg extended behind to the sky will do that to you. But I almost want you to explore your mental state in that 30-second hold even more: What’s beneath your endless thoughts, what Buddhists call the “monkey mind?” What are the stories your mind spins? Can you let go of them before they carry you down the river and drop you off at I’m Furious and I Don’t Even Know Why Town? You know what I mean — when you start having a conversation with somebody in your head that turns into a full-blown argument. All of a sudden you’re completely livid, and nothing has actually happened. Or is that only me?
Underneath all of that is where you can begin to find the unflappable you, the you you strive to be, but the you who inevitably gets knocked out of sorts daily, sometimes hourly, by the stuff of life. It reminds me of an Eckhart Tolle quote I recently saw. He’s the spiritual author of New York Times best-sellers “The Power of Now” and “A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life’s Purpose.”
“You do not become good by trying to be good,” he said, “but by finding the goodness that is already within you and allowing that goodness to emerge.”
I can only tap into this briefly, sometimes in meditation or yoga postures, such as corpse pose at the end of class, or by sitting in nature, before all the drama and ego come crashing back in. But it’s there waiting, every second of every day. And better to tap in for a millisecond than to let it go untouched for a lifetime.

States move to combat widespread use of fraudulent emotional support animals

Texto completo: Some critics are arguing that encountering a domesticated alligator walking down the street or moving next door to someone with a pet duck indicate that "emotional support" animals are getting a little out of hand.
This year has sparked controversy nationwide regarding emotional support animals and the qualifications to acquire them.
The New York Times dove into this debate, as the concept has become more and more popular over the years alongside discussions of mental health.
More than 24 state legislatures have passed laws to combat service animal "fraud," referencing those who either lie about needing emotional support from an animal or about their animal being a certified emotional support animal.
Of these legislatures, Utah has made this fraud a misdemeanor, Oklahoma granted restaurants and stores the right to reject support animals, and Virginia outlaws websites that grant E.S.A. verification letters simply by paying a fee and nothing else.
This apparent outbreak of needing emotional support animals has caused some issues in public areas — including airplane passengers being bit by emotional support dogs.
United Airlines closed a loophole in January for passengers attempting to finesse their animals onto their flights, saying in a statement that the policy will "further ensure the well-being of our employees and customers while accommodating passengers with disabilities." Someone previously tried to board a United flight at the Newark International Airport in New Jersey with an "emotional support peacock."
Emotional support animals seem to be as highly protected as service animals under the Fair Housing Act, which states, "Persons with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation for any assistance animal, including an emotional support animal."
This includes establishments with a "no pet policy."
"A true service animal is a highly-trained dog," said Tammie Townley, a state representative in Oklahoma. "When someone comes in with an emotional support animal, they are saying, 'It's my service animal.' No — it's something you bought a vest for."
"It's really hard to draw a bright line," said Todd Weiler, a state senator in Utah. "To a large extent, everybody could benefit from having a pet. When is it an emotional support animal and when it is a pet?"
"My basic stance is that mental illness is tough," said Matthew Deitz, litigation director of the Disability Independence Group. "Anything that makes somebody feel better, why not? As long as you don't hurt anybody else, what's the big deal?"

Texto completo: Varios inmigrantes indocumentados que fueron despedidos de los clubes de golf del presidente Donald Trump en Nueva Jersey y Nueva York le tienen una sorpresa nada agradable al mandatari durante su mitin en Florida, donde lanzará su campaña de reelección presidencia.
El abogado Aníbal Romero , quien representa a los inmigrantes, dijo que los inmigrantes harán una conferencia de prensa para defender la reforma migratoria el mismo día y en la misma ciudad en que el presidente Trump estará lanzando su campaña de reelección.
“Estos empleados que trabajan para Donald Trump representan a cientos de personas que han trabajado para él como inmigrantes indocumentados, y muestra cómo la Administración puede fácilmente vilipendiar y demonizar a los inmigrantes y, sin embargo, no tiene problemas para contratarlos”, expresó Romero.
Margarita Cruz y Adela García , examas de llaves en el Trump National Golf Club Westchester, así como Wiston Blandon, un ex lavaplatos en ese mismo club asistirán a la conferencia de prensa en Orlando.
Tamibén estarán presentes Sandra Díaz y Victorina Morales, examas de llaves en el club de Trump en Bedminster, Nueva Jersey.
El caso de estos inmigrantes conmocionó al país, al revelarse que el Organización Trump contrataba a extranjeros sin permisos de trabajo, mientras las políticas del presidente iban en sentido contrario.
La historia fue contada en diciembre de 2018 por Díaz y Morales a The New York Times , donde detallaron su experiencia en el club de Nueva Jersey.

A fighter or a peacemaker? Amy Klobuchar is trying to be both.

Resumen: The Minnesota senator has passed more bills than any 2020 rival, and has won over moderates and conservatives. That may not be what Democrats want.

Texto completo: In a Democratic primary field filled with partisan warriors, Sen. Amy Klobuchar is sometimes cast as too moderate, too “Minnesota nice” to fire up the Democratic base and win back the White House. 
“Some people will find her boring,” says Steve Schier, a political science professor at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota. “But Trump may have made boring attractive.”
Within the Democratic Party, there’s unanimity about the urgency of replacing President Donald Trump. But there’s an internal debate about how best to do that, a debate that could be described as fighters versus peacemakers – the Bernies versus the Betos. The fighters are passionate, even angry, about systemic economic and racial injustices that they say President Trump did not cause but has accelerated. The peacemakers are more concerned with partisan polarization and the coarsening of national discourse, which they believe is undermining America’s strengths and ability to surmount the challenges it faces.
Enter Senator Klobuchar, who is in some ways trying to be both: positioning herself as a fighter who can bring America together – with neither angry speeches nor kumbaya sessions, but with conviction and heart.
“[She] is clearly ready to fight and be critical of the president,” says Neil Levesque, director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, which hosted Senator Klobuchar for a Politics & Eggs event last week. “But a lot of what she said is ‘We’ve got to bring everyone together.’”
The senator and her supporters argue that you don’t need to be an ideological crusader to beat President Trump. She has one of the strongest records of any Democrat when it comes to winning over moderate and conservative voters; in 2018, she won 42 Minnesota counties that went for President Trump two years prior. And as she talks about civility and needing to bridge America’s divides, she also emphasizes that she’s got a backbone of steel – fittingly for the granddaughter of an iron ore miner in northern Minnesota. 
On Tuesday, she released a plan outlining more than 100 “concrete steps” she would take during her first 100 days in the White House – everything from rejoining the Paris climate agreement to allowing prescription drugs to be imported from Canada to updating Department of Justice guidelines on enforcing antitrust laws.
“If you’re a progressive, you’d better make progress. You can’t just talk about it; you actually have to get things done,” Senator Klobuchar said to reporters after her Politics & Eggs appearance.
Ranked the most effective Democratic senator in the 2017-19 Congress, she has passed more bills than any other lawmaker running for president – including nearly five times as many as fellow senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
She is currently lagging well behind both of them in the latest Iowa poll, however, with only 4% support in the state that will kick off the Democratic nomination process next February. Heading into the first Democratic debates next week, her national poll numbers average around 1%.
“The odds don’t favor her,” says Professor Schier. “When you have 24 candidates, the probability of anyone who is not already well known nationally [winning the nomination] is pretty low.”
Still, as a Minnesota Vikings fan, she knows things don’t always end up the way they start. And maybe, for once, that could work in a Minnesotan’s favor.
The right kind of fighter? Senator Klobuchar kicked off her presidential campaign outdoors on a 14-degree day in the middle of a Minneapolis snowstorm. No hat, no gloves. Because she wanted people to know she has grit.
But that image of toughness got the wrong kind of burnishing thanks to a series of stories about her track record as a demanding boss, including a New York Times piece about how Senator Klobuchar – exasperated with an aide who forgot to get her utensils to eat a takeout salad on the plane – ate her salad with a comb and then told the staffer to clean it. The story was based on four former staffers’ accounts, none of whom spoke on the record.
“I know I can be tough; I know I can push people too hard, and I also know I can do better – and I will,” Senator Klobuchar told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in a statement.
Former staffer Zach Rodvold likened working for her to Navy SEAL training. “It’s not intended to be fun. It’s hard,” he told the Star Tribune. “But what you get from it is you become very, very good at what you do.”
It is perhaps ironic that a candidate criticized in the press for being too tough as a boss is conversely being portrayed as not enough of a fighter to go to bat for progressive issues, or to take on President Trump.
But Democratic voters are looking for a particular kind of tough, and New Hampshire resident Marie Duggan for one isn’t sure Senator Klobuchar fits the bill. Back in March, she told the Monitor she could see the Minnesota senator breaking up banks – in contrast to former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke, whom she had come to see at Keene State College, where she teaches economics. But after hearing Senator Klobuchar in person later this spring, she was less impressed.
“Amy is obviously a fighter by temperament, but she’s not going to show that to us,” says Professor Duggan, who is still paying off her student debt 18 years after finishing her Ph.D. and feels an urgency about fixing a broken economic system. “For me, a person that’s drowning in the current situation – she didn’t say that she would do anything about it.”
‘So New Hampshire!’ For a candidate who’s been criticized as both bland and overbearing, Senator Klobuchar is surprisingly dynamic and warm on the campaign trail.
“She loves people; she loves talking to people. More importantly, what I’ve observed is she really listens to people,” says Karen Cornelius, one of the senator’s closest friends in law school who is now working as an unpaid special adviser to the campaign in New Hampshire.
She describes a lesser-known side of the senator as a student at the University of Chicago, where she was the smartest member of their four-woman study group but also loved going out and dancing to Prince and Tina Turner. “She’s not what would be described as a nerd at all,” Ms. Cornelius says. “She was a rock star.”
Whereas other candidates on the trail here often begin with their personal story – Mr. O’Rourke launched right into talking about his hometown of El Paso and his views on the southern border crisis before a crowd of people who live within a bike ride of Canada – Senator Klobuchar starts with the people of New Hampshire.
She calls out more than half a dozen attendees, lauds the work of the state’s two female senators, and extols an 11-year-old who asked for her autograph in church on Easter Sunday and then showed up the next day at a town hall meeting in Peterborough, N.H., where he raised his hand during the Q&A. “I’d like to know if you think if Bob Mueller testifies,” she recalls the boy asking, “should he go before the House or Senate first, and should he be at the intelligence committee or the judiciary?”
“ So New Hampshire !” she tells the crowd.
Not one for soaring rhetoric, Senator Klobuchar instead drills down on issues that New Hampshire voters care about – like the opioid crisis and access to broadband internet.
Iceland, she says, is wired for broadband. “I’ve been there – because that’s a vacation for people from Minnesota,” she jokes.
She pokes fun at President Trump – we have to use humor back at him, she tells the crowd – but also makes serious policy proposals on everything from immigration and infrastructure to mental health. But the tone remains bright throughout, without the Sturm und Drang that characterizes some of her rivals’ stump speeches. She talks about governing from a standpoint of opportunity, rather than chaos and division.
“Anger is not a plan. Anger is not how you govern. Anger is how we got to where we are right now,” says Michael Atkins, a lawyer in Peterborough who came to hear the senator at the Politics & Eggs breakfast.
That said, he and his law firm partner, Jim Callahan, haven’t the slightest concern about whether she’s tough enough to parry President Trump’s jabs.
“I think she’s going to bust an aikido move and deftly avoid it,” says Mr. Callahan, who got interested in Senator Klobuchar after seeing her calm but firm questioning of then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh during last fall’s contentious Supreme Court confirmation hearings. “She’ll turn it on its head to her advantage.”
“You don’t have to fight back with insults and the like,” agrees Mr. Atkins. “You should fight back with strength of character.”

THE FACTS ABOUT BIDEN’S SWEEPING, INCAUTIOUS PROMISE TO END CANCER: Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden promised last week that if he is elected to the Oval Office, "we're gonna cure cancer."
It was definitive in a way that the statement he made as vice president in 2015 — “If I could be anything, I would have wanted to have been the president that ended cancer, because it's possible" — was not.
On the one hand, Biden's sweeping promise, which some online critics derided as irresponsibly optimistic, isn't as lofty as it might appear at first glance. Some cancers are already considered curable, and scientists believe they're close to curing others.
On the other hand, cancer is not just one disease; it has more than 100 types, and since former President Richard Nixon declared a "war on cancer" in 1971, the way that scientists think about a cure has changed.
Scientists now understand that cancer is far more complex than was once believed, and that what works to treat one person, or one type of cancer, might not work for another. Even if a person survives 10 years after receiving treatment for cancer, there is always a risk that a cancer can return, or that another kind can spring up that's fatal.
"These cancers are dormant or they hibernate and then they show up later, so you can almost use ‘cured' in quotation marks," said Dr. Eric Haura, chair of the Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute's thoracic oncology program. "The best we can say is, 'We see no evidence of your cancer,' but that’s not the same thing as being cured."

STAFF CHANGES AT HHS: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Monday that he was promoting Judy Stecker to deputy chief of staff for operations and strategy and will soon name a deputy chief of staff for policy to serve under chief of staff Brian Harrison.
PHARMA COMPANIES SUE HHS OVER DRUG PRICE TRANSPARENCY RULE: Major U.S. drug manufacturers, including Merck, Eli Lilly and Co., and Amgen, filed suit against the Trump administration Friday to contest an HHS rule that companies must display drug prices in all television ads. The HHS rule, finalized in May, is part of a wider effort to encourage drug companies to lower prices and promote transparency.
BORDER PATROL AGENTS FALL PREY TO ILLNESSES PLAGUING MIGRANT HOLDING CENTERS: Border Patrol agents in Texas are worried about illnesses frequently popping up among detainees at stations across the southern border, according to union representatives. Border Patrol’s holding facilities in the Del Rio and El Paso sectors, or regions, are inundated with sick detainees, as well as sick agents. “Scabies, chickenpox — we had one case of the mumps here in Uvalde. I wanna say we had measles — plenty of the flu, plenty of colds, body lice, just assorted,” said Jon Anfinsen, a National Border Patrol Council vice president and based in Del Rio. “And some of these things, they spread like wildfires when you get into a cramped holding cell. It happens.”
OVER 5,000 MIGRANTS IN QUARANTINE AFTER EXPOSURE TO MUMPS, CHICKENPOX: Immigration and Customs Enforcement has quarantined 5,200 adult migrants after exposure to both mumps and chickenpox, as almost 40 migrant detentions centers nationwide have confirmed cases of both viral infections.
RULING: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CAN’T BLOCK UNDOCUMENTED TEENS FROM GETTING ABORTIONS: A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the Trump administration cannot enforce a policy that bars undocumented teenage immigrants from having abortions. In Friday’s 2-1 ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found the policy contradicted Supreme Court precedent that the federal government cannot place an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. The Friday ruling held up a judge’s decision last year that blocked the policy.
PUBLIC OPTION OR WASHINGTON STATE-STYLE RATE CAP COULD EXTEND COVERAGE TO MORE THAN 1 MILLION, URBAN INSTITUTE FINDS: The left-of-center Urban Institute found that a combined approach of increasing Obamacare subsidies to the middle class and either instituting a public health plan option or capping the rates that private medical providers get for their services to Medicare levels — similar to what Washington state plans to do — could increase health insurance coverage by 1.2 million people in 2020 and save the federal government $12 billion. Researchers say either initiative would most effectively lower premiums for people in areas with the least competitive insurance markets, especially rural areas.
PROMINENT DEMOCRATS PRESS HHS ON OBAMACARE CHANGES THAT CMS ADMINISTRATOR WARNED ABOUT: Democratic leaders on the Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and Education and Labor Committees demanded answers Friday from HHS about Trump administration policies to change the Affordable Care Act that even Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said would have negative effects.
One of the three changes was to alter the pricing index used to figure out how much money ACA enrollees get in subsidies for coverage. It was finalized, even though Verma warned in 2018 that it would cause “coverage losses, further premium increases, and market disruption.” Verma also objected to the other two changes in 2018, a ban on “silver loading” and automatic reenrollment.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A war crimes trial involving a Navy SEAL who is charged with killing a teenage Islamic State prisoner began Monday, according to several media outlets.
Navy SEAL Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher is accused of using a knife to kill a teenage Islamic State prisoner in Iraq. He is also accused of killing unarmed Iraqi civilians, which included a school-aged girl, according to the New York Times.
Gallagher has pleaded not guilty and denies all the charges, the Times also reported.
Jury selection for the trial began Monday, and is expected to take one to two days, according to Reuters. The jury will include between five and 15 active-duty Navy servicemembers -- half of whom are officers and half of whom are enlisted -- who will hear the case and render a verdict, Reuters also reported.
The lead prosecutor, Cmdr. Christopher Czaplak, has been removed by the court-martial for tracking the defense team’s emails. Gallagher's case also recently received national media attention after suggestions by President Donald Trump that he may pardon the Navy SEAL, according to the Associated Press.
Last month, several outlets reported that Trump was considering a pardon for Gallagher. The president in March also moved Gallagher to "less restrictive confinement" due to the "honor of his past service to our country. "
A SEAL medic said he had stabilized the teenage prisoner when Gallagher walked up and stabbed him in the neck and body, according to prosecutors. He went on to pose with the prisoner's body and included it as a prop in his re-enlistment ceremony. He bragged that he "got this one with my knife. "
More: Trump may pardon troops in war crime cases, including SEAL Edward Gallagher, reports say
In addition, investigators said Gallagher fired randomly at crowds of civilians. He was accused of shooting an elderly man carting a water jug in Mosul in June 2017, as well as a girl walking along a riverbank in the same area just a month later.
Gallagher has been charged with premeditated murder in the killing of the teenage prisoner and attempted murder in the shootings of the two civilians. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He contends that his accusers, members of his platoon, "disgruntled subordinates who could not meet his high standards," the New York Times reported.
The Times also reported that a Facebook page regularly updated by Gallagher's family recently posted a message that said in part: " 'Over the course of the trial we will expose the false narrative spread by these accusers for what it is … a smear campaign full of lies. ' "
At hearings last month, it was revealed that the prosecution sought to track emails from Gallagher's defense team in an effort to find a leak to the media. Czaplak and agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service sent emails embedded with hidden tracking software to Gallagher's lawyers and a journalist for the Navy Times, according to the New York Times.
The trial, which is taking place at U. S. Naval Base San Diego, is expected to last three weeks, Reuters reported.

Texto completo: Jennifer Weiner, New York Times bestselling author of 16 juicy, layered, courageous books, always knew she wanted to write a novel that followed her characters from birth to death.
She knew she wanted that book to be loosely based on her own life and the lives of the women she knew most intimately.
"I wanted to write about two sisters who start out as daughters and become mothers (or not), two women who begin their lives in one world, live through seismic changes, and end up in a very different place -- a world that's changed quickly in some regards, not fast enough in others," she writes in the introduction to her new book, "Mrs. Everything," her longest, and most ambitious to date.
"And I always knew that I wanted to write about a woman like my mother," she continues, "who was born in the 1940s and came of age in the 1960s, who married a man, had children, got divorced, and ended up falling in love with a woman, watching same-sex marriage become legal, and living a life that would not have been possible 40 years ago."
When Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, she knew it was time.
"It's almost a response to that slogan, 'Make America Great Again,'" Weiner told me Friday by phone. "I wanted to look at what America was like for women in the '50s, in the '60s, in the '70s. Let's look at all the expectations and restrictions and judgment that shaped women's choices for so long. And let's look at where we started and let's look at where we've gotten and let's look into the future and really ask ourselves, 'Are things better? Are we more free? Do we have more choices? And what still needs to change?'"
"Mrs. Everything" is the story of Jo and Bethie Kaufman, two sisters who grow up in Detroit in the '50s and '60s. Their mother tries to keep their world small, like hers, but Jo and Bethie, each in quite different ways, bristle at the confinement.
Throughout the book, the sisters -- Jo, especially -- learn to measure their own needs against what the people in their lives want them to need. Occasionally they choose to prioritize their own longings and safety and self-worth. Often they don't.
"Certainly not everyone shares these specific characters' lives," Weiner said. "Not everybody is gay and closeted. Not everybody is in an interracial marriage and deciding if she wants children and deciding she doesn't. But the idea of having to weigh what you want and what's going to make you happy against what the world expects from you and what makes other people happy, I think that's totally universal."
That tug -- honoring your truth versus pleasing the world -- is a theme woven throughout Weiner's writing, both in her fiction and in her 2016 memoir, "Hungry Heart: Adventures in Life, Love, and Writing." It's inspired in part, she said, by the words of poet and activist Muriel Rukeyser: "What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? The world would split open."
"I've always believed in the power of words, the power of stories, the power of narratives to change the world," she told me.
In researching "Mrs. Everything," Weiner said, she spent hours and hours poring through magazines from the era in which Jo and Bethie and their mom would be seeking guidance on how to look, what to think, who to be.
"As a writer," she said, "I want to get the details right. I want people to feel the shag carpet under their feet if I'm talking about the '70s. I want people to smell the Giorgio perfume if I'm writing about the '80s."
Old issues of Ladies' Home Journal and Seventeen magazines provided her context. Some of what she read surprised her.
"I expected it to be a lot of diet advice and how-to-keep-your-man advice and how-to-be-popular advice," she said. "And there was some of that. But there was also, 'Here's how to go be an exchange student and live in Japan for 6 months.' 'We interviewed this young woman who dreamed of going to Broadway and she made the leap.'
"They were very quietly radical in a way," she continued. "Certainly there was the diet stuff, there were the makeup tips. But also there was some nod toward, 'You can have a happy, independent life that doesn't depend on a boyfriend or a husband.'"
And as Jo and Bethie's fictional stories remind us, girls and women reading those articles were likely weighing that potential against the expectations placed on them by their family, their friends, the culture at large.
Weiner was in her 20s when her mom, who had been divorced from Weiner's dad for a decade, fell in love with a woman. It was the late '90s. Marriage equality was more than a decade away. Matthew Shepard had just been beaten, tortured and left for dead for having the audacity to be gay.
"I remember being sort of worried for my mom," Weiner said. "It was a very different time."
"Mrs. Everything" begins in 1951 and ends in 2016. They were all very different times. The characters bear witness to all the turmoil and progress and setbacks therein. Weiner takes us inside their heads and their hearts as they do so.
Weiner's books are often called "beach reads." (Full disclosure: I read "Mrs. Everything" on a beach, during my kids' spring break.) I asked her whether that label does her writing justice.
"I think a beach read can be any book you want to take with you," she said. "I'm happy if people consider this a beach read. I wanted it to be funny. I wanted it to be sexy. I wanted it to be entertaining."
It's all that and more.

Weighing the Cost of Personal Travel

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
I have written thousands of articles for The New York Times. Only one, so far, has cast me as a planet-destroying villain.
This adventure began when my editor on the Metro desk here at The Times took a new job running the Travel section and invited me to write an article for her sometime.
Thanks, I said, but the only travel story I want to do is one questioning the moral defensibility of long-distance leisure travel in the age of climate change.
"You're on," replied the editor, Amy Virshup, to my surprise.
Now I had to write it. And I knew there was no way to do that without addressing my own complicity.
First, though, I had to figure out how guilty I was: a way to quantify the global damage caused by one person's travel.
It turns out that in 2016, two climatologists published an article suggesting a direct, linear relationship between carbon emissions and the melting of the Arctic's summer ice cover.
Their finding: Every metric ton of carbon dioxide or its equivalent shrinks the ice cover by three square meters, or 32 square feet. Picture the entire Arctic sea ice cover getting a tiny bit thinner, and 32 square feet of it disappearing at the edges.
"This number is sufficiently intuitive to allow one to grasp the contribution of personal CO2 emissions to the loss of Arctic sea ice," the researchers wrote dryly.
Indeed. I plugged in numbers from a carbon-footprint calculator and ... no, that couldn't be right. But I kept doing the math and kept getting the same answer: My family's one-week winter-break trip to Florida would shrink the ice cover by 90 square feet.
By this point, we had already decided to go to Greece for summer vacation, a far more destructive journey. I felt compelled to mention this, too, at the end of the article. I could not think of anything to say about it other than that we planned to buy carbon offsets to counteract the effects of our flights, and hope for the best.
The article was published online last week (and in Sunday's paper). A lot of readers were furious when they got to the end.
"You are literally performing the cop-out that your article purports to critique," someone wrote on Twitter.
"You've broken my heart," someone else wrote, "knowing full well the consequences and yet still choosing personal gratification over the hope that your 'sacrifice' will help as every small action adds up."
Other readers, conversely, were irked that I was focusing on individual travel at all. They said I was letting big corporations and governments off the hook for their refusal to make huge across-the-board changes to stop global warming.
In any case, I have kept my word. On Monday, I went to the website of a nonprofit called Cool Effect that sells offsets and gave it $ 168 to support a project to install biogas digesters in households in China and Vietnam.
A biogas digester is basically a vat with a pipe attached to it. You put manure -- cow, pig, human, whatever -- and water in it. As the manure decomposes, it releases methane, a greenhouse gas far more destructive than carbon dioxide. The pipe connects to your cookstove, and you cook with the methane -- burning it off pollutes much less than just releasing it, and much less than burning coal or wood.
According to Cool Effect's math, my donation will prevent the emission of the equivalent of 30 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Our seats on the flights to Greece would emit 10 metric tons.
By some calculations, then, our vacation would be a net win for the planet.
But of course it's not so simple. There's considerable disagreement about the effectiveness of carbon offsets, and whether they really bring about conservation measures that would not have happened without the purchase of the offset.
Some critics point out that buying plane tickets at all keeps airports expanding and the aviation industry growing.
I asked Peter Miller, a director at the Natural Resources Defense Council who also serves on the board of the country's biggest carbon-offset registry, if I had bought my way to a clean conscience.
"It does make an incremental contribution in the right direction," he said. "But there is the rest of your life and your family's life that is still responsible for helping cause climate change."
As dispensations go, I'll take it.

Waiting for new lungs, advocating for others

Texto completo: Nineteen-year-old Maddi Bertrand of Glen Ellyn is a leading voice in a somber new video by The New York Times, which notes that 11,000 Americans will die this year while waiting for organ transplants. Chicago’s Lurie Children’s Hospital will give Maddi a Hope and Courage award Wednesday for her wide range of contributions, including her advocacy efforts that helped lead to a change in the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21 in Illinois as of July 1.
She’s been raising money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation since she staged Maddi’s Marvelous Mayfair fundraiser at the age of 7. She’s successfully lobbied for smoke-free bike paths and parks. She never turns down a chance as a speaker to raise funds and awareness on behalf of people with cystic fibrosis.
"And I will for the rest of my life until a cure is found," Maddi says. Then she coughs a dozen times into a paper towel, grimaces, removes the oxygen tubes from her nose to blow into a tissue, and pauses for nearly a minute to give her body time to catch up. CF is a life-shortening, progressive, genetic disease that affects the pancreas and causes a thick mucus to form in the lungs.
"I’m definitely sicker than I was a month ago," she says. The attention and awards are nice, but what she really wants is a new set of lungs.
Born in Pennsylvania, one of the few states at the time that tested newborns for cystic fibrosis, Maddi got diagnosed and started treatment earlier than many CF patients, says her mother, Linda Bertrand.
"When I was in elementary school and middle school, I could do sports," Maddi says, noting that she even played the rough game of lacrosse. "Whenever I’d join a team, I’d get sick, end up in the hospital, and then the season would wind down."
She plays the flute and piano, did martial arts with her brother, and was healthy enough to be a section leader in the marching band and take on roles in a couple of plays during high school.
"I’ve gone from this tiny backpack to a tank because I’ve been needing more oxygen," says Maddi, whose senior photos featured one with the oxygen tubes and one without. She takes a couple dozen pills each day, and undergoes three or four daily lung treatments. In spite of missing weeks of school, she made it to prom and graduated from Glenbard West High School in 2018 with the rest of her class. On Feb. 2, 2018, she went on the lung transplant waiting list.
"She’s a very smart, determined and wonderful young woman," says Lisa Mulvaney, coordinator of the creative arts program at Lurie Children’s, and the person who recruited Maddi for the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board in 2013. "From Day One, she was really invested in this group of kids and about making the hospital even better. She never wants to miss a meeting."
Maddi dragged her oxygen tank onto a Metra train and ordered a ride service once she got into Chicago to make one board meeting. Because CF patients can get sick when near other CF patients, Maddi is the only representative of that disease on the board, which has members aged 12 to 19.
"She really displays such hope and such courage," Mulvaney says. "She wants to give as much as she can."
As a freshman in high school, Maddie became the first CF patient to complete the Xtreme Hike: a one-day, 21-mile hike with her mom through the hills of the Manistee National Forest in Michigan. Maddi has helped host three proms for the inpatients at Lurie Children’s. She attended the first International Children’s Advisory Network summit in Washington, D.C. Her mother recalls how Maddi didn’t get a chance to meet with then-U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois. "But I recognized his wheelchair at the airport," says Maddi, who walked up, introduced herself, and had a nice chat about the importance of funding research for CF and other diseases that affect children.
The New York Times video featuring Maddi was produced by Kendall Ciesemier, an original member of the Lurie Children’s Kids Advisory Board from Wheaton, and a member of the 2010-11 Daily Herald Leadership Team. At age 11, Ciesemier founded Kids Caring 4 Kids, which helps children in Africa impacted by AIDS. Her work was recognized by then-President Bill Clinton and Oprah Winfrey. Born with a rare liver disorder, Ciesemier was the recipient of two liver transplants.
"I want people to know that donating organs is so important and that I wouldn’t be alive without the generosity of a stranger," Ciesemier says via email. "I take the gift that someone gave me very seriously and I focus a lot on paying it forward. … I like to believe that I can give people hope."
Maddi says she maintains her hope.
"Of course, I want new lungs, but I’ll wait as long as it takes. I’m happy," says Maddi, who notes the transplant wait is tricky. "I have to be really sick to be at the top of the list, but I have to be healthy enough for the surgery. This is so crazy."
She gets support from her brother Zach, 16, and sisters Grace, 13, and Gabbi, 11, but Maddi says her strength comes from her Christian faith. "God’s in control," she says. "Whenever I’m down and don’t know if I can do this, I lean on God. I know He will get me the right pair of lungs."
She’s learning to play a new religious song on the piano, with the lyric, "I will fight for you." Transplanted lungs would be free of CF, but recovery from the surgery can be grueling, and requires lifelong medications and care. Imagining her life with new lungs and the ability to breathe, Maddi sees herself going to college and becoming a trainer who works with dolphins at Clearwater Marine Aquarium, the Florida not-for-profit whose care of sick and injured marine animals was made into two "Dolphin Tale" movies. Anchored close to home while she waits for her transplant, Maddi also dreams of traveling to Florida, New York, Hawaii and California, and doing some of those things that CF denied her.
"When I get these new lungs," Maddi says, breaking into a sly grin, "I want to live a little first."

Texto completo: Last week we watched an unusual spectacle. The foreign minister of Germany, one of the United States’ closest allies, went to Tehran and announced that a European payment system, designed as an alternative to the dollar-based one, would soon be ready. This visit was made in coordination with Britain and France, both of which helped create the new payment mechanism, called INSTEX.
INSTEX will probably fail or prove to be wholly inadequate in the short term. The dollar’s dominance in global transactions — which has been a huge benefit for America — will be hard to displace, but INSTEX is a warning sign, the canary in the coal mine. America’s closest allies are working hard to chip away at a crucial underpinning of U.S. global power.
Why? It’s simple: the Trump administration’s abuse of this power. The United States sits atop the world for now, but there are forces eroding that lofty status. Some of these are deep structural shifts, like the rise of China. But as The Economist points out, others are reactions to a pattern of hegemonic abuse.
Consider the trigger for this search for an alternative to the dollar. Britain, France and Germany are all signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. When the Trump administration unilaterally reneged on the pact last year — even though Iran had abided by it — the U.S. reimposed sanctions, using its dollar power to prevent other countries from doing business with Iran (since most international transactions use the dollar for convenience). Furious at this misuse of authority, the Europeans have set about trying to create a new payment system.
They are not the only ones. The Chinese, Russian and Indians have also been trying to create mechanisms that would allow them to escape the hegemony of the dollar. So far, these efforts have been largely ineffective. But if so many major trading nations, including key European ones, set out to subvert the dollar, they will eventually have some impact. Once upon a time, the British pound was the dominant international currency, but it was supplanted by the dollar. There is no iron law that says the dollar will be king forever.
Or look at the way the Trump administration has been wielding the threat of tariffs. In many cases, the administration has invoked a "national security" concerns. The law that allows the president to levy such tariffs was passed during the Cold War to enable the country to preserve critical industries that might be needed to sustain the geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Canadian aluminum and Japanese-made SUVs don’t fit the bill, even if Trump thinks otherwise. As Jennifer Hillman, the former general counsel to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, wrote recently in The New York Times: "If the United States can justify tariffs on cars as a threat to national security, then every country in the world can most likely justify restrictions on almost any product under a similar claim."
The United States has legitimate complaints about China’s trade practices. Beijing will often follow the letter of the law but find clever ways to undermine its spirit through loopholes and exceptions. But that is precisely what the Trump administration is itself doing. By misusing the national security exemption, it is weakening the very trade rules and international laws that it is asking China to follow. If I were a Chinese negotiator, I would simply explain that I would follow trade rules just as much as Donald Trump does.
Or consider Trump’s efforts to crush Chinese tech behemoth Huawei. So far, very few countries have followed America’s ban, but almost all are surely noting that if they remain reliant on crucial American technologies, Washington could suddenly cripple them on a whim. The result will be a greater desire for technological self-reliance and a shift away from American companies.
America still occupies a unique position in the world. But it is clear that we are moving into an era in which more players will have more power. Twenty years ago, China accounted for 3% of global GDP; today its share is 15% and rising. In such a period, it is all the more important that Washington act with restraint, use international institutions and try to establish consensus.
The administration is acting to achieve some short-term gains in limited transactions with other countries. But by abusing its power to do so, it is putting at risk the structure of the international system in which American power is so deeply embedded. It is a bad trade and one for which all Americans will pay the price in decades to come.

Texto completo: My mother told me years ago to never try to find a man like my father. If I compared anyone to him, that man would fall short.
To this day, she’s right.
I lost my dad 7 years ago, due to pancreatic cancer (the same kind Alex Trebek has). So Father’s Day is a bittersweet time for me.
He was the kind of man everyone adored.
He was measured. He was quiet. He was patient.
He had to be all of those things with three strong and fierce women in his house. People often said that he was the eye of our female hurricane.
He was also practical. He always drove white Subarus. Used ones.
One time he ventured out of his comfort zone and bought a red Subaru. I was so proud of him. He kept it for three days, and then returned it, because it was “too flashy.”
“Cops pull red cars over way more times than other colors,” he said.
At one point in my life, I was deciding between going to medical school and going to the London School of Economics. He didn’t sway me either way. He just bought me an “A to Zed” guide to London, and typed out a typical weekly schedule for the life of a physician. (He was a pediatrician.) I chose London.
He and my mom rarely fought. But on one instance, they stood on opposite sides of a decision, at an impasse. They were buying a minivan. My mom wanted one with captain’s chairs in the back seat. But the slightly cheaper option was the minivan with a bench in the back. My mom threw up her hands and turned the situation over to me.
My dad and I went to the car dealership in Draper. We test-drove both versions. At the end, I looked at him, and said, “Get the one Mom wants.”
He wiped his hand down his face and said, “I know. That always seems to be the right answer.”
My dad would take my sister and me on day trips to go biking in Moab. It was during one of these trips that he taught us some important advice: If you have to pass gas, make sure the car vent is on, and make sure it’s not on recirculation.
One year, a few days before Halloween, my dad’s mom passed away. The next day, my dad turned yellow. Jaundiced. And then on Halloween, we got the grim news: He had pancreatic cancer. Six to 18 months to live.
He had none of the risk factors. He wasn’t overweight. He didn’t drink. He didn’t smoke. Not a day in his life. He was still young.
My family kept our spirits high as we fought his battle. We even renamed common hospital phrases like, “On a scale of one to 10, how much pain are you in?”
My sister and I would instead say, “On a scale of one to seven, which dwarf are you? Icky, Barfy, Pukey, Yucky, Crummy, Crappy or Pissy?” We dreaded the days when he was all the way to Pissy.
While waiting during procedures, we would write what we thought were hilarious cancer-related limericks.
There once was a vial of bile
Whose removal made us all smile
Dr. Wills made a cut
Rather close to the butt
And the bile now flows down de-Nile
Then he would wake up and we would rush to his bedside, read him the limerick, and ask him, “On a scale of one to 10, how funny are we?”
He outlasted the 18-month prognosis. We had him for four more years. He was healthy for almost every day of those four years, until the week before we lost him.
I have to fight the urge to rail against the heavens about how unfair it is to lose someone you love to cancer. The disease is unflinching in its destruction.
But then I think of how many years I got with this man, and when my mom and I reflect on the time, we often quote a line from the show “Downton Abbey.”
“Aren’t we the lucky ones.”

Irreplaceable music master tapes destroyed in 2008 fire

Texto completo: In stark contrast to official statements offered more than a decade ago, a 2008 fire at Universal Studios Hollywood destroyed a staggering number of original master recordings stored there by the Universal Music Group, according to an investigation published last week by the New York Times Magazine.

The devastation, which company officials downplayed or outright dismissed after the fire was extinguished 11 years ago this month, is breathtaking in scope, amounting to what the new report describes as "the biggest disaster in the history of the music industry."

"This is a tragedy," Elliot Roberts, longtime manager to Neil Young, told The Times. Young did not lose any master recordings in the fire. "You can yell, you can jump up and down, you can look to insurance, you can sue," said Roberts, "but if you lose a master, you're [sunk]."

UMG quickly disputed the New York Times report, citing "numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets."

"Music preservation is of the highest priority for us and we are proud of our track record," said the statement issued Tuesday. "While there are constraints preventing us from publicly addressing some of the details of the fire that occurred at NBCUniversal Studios facility more than a decade ago, the incident -- while deeply unfortunate -- never affected the availability of the commercially released music nor impacted artists' compensation."

These first generation master recordings spanning more than half a century's worth of music may total 500,000 individual tracks, the report says, including such cultural touchstones as Bill Haley & His Comets' genre-launching hit "Rock Around the Clock," the Kingsmen's garage-rock classic "Louie Louie," Etta James' immortal ballad of romantic reconciliation "At Last" and quite possibly the entire recorded catalogs of artists including Billie Holiday and Buddy Holly.

Other artists whose master recordings were destroyed include jazz greats Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, John Coltrane and Dizzy Gillespie; blues masters Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Bo Diddley, John Lee Hooker, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy and Little Walter; and most of the original rock-defining recordings made at Chicago's Chess Records label by Chuck Berry.

Some of Aretha Franklin's earliest recordings also are believed to be among those destroyed, along with outtakes and never-released recordings by hundreds, if not thousands, of musicians, among them Elton John, Cat Stevens, Nirvana, the Eagles, Aerosmith, Steely Dan, Ray Charles, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Soundgarden, Hole, Eminem, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg.

Among the record labels whose master recordings were housed at the lot were Decca, Chess, Impulse, MCA, ABC, A&M, Geffen and Interscope.

Although a good percentage of those recordings remain in circulation, the loss of the original master recordings precludes future sonic upgrades to the commercially available versions.

"Working without the master tapes," latter-day Beatles reissue producer Giles Martin is quoted in the Times piece saying, "would be like a chef having to use precooked food."

The Roots drummer Questlove responded with a tweet advising fans that the fire is the reason some of the group's albums won't be reissued.

At the time, Universal Music officials dismissed concerns about what had been stored there, saying most of the recordings were copies, not originals, and that any originals had been converted to digital copies and therefore were safely backed up.

"In a sense, nothing was lost," a UMG spokesman told The Times shortly after the June 1, 2008, blaze had been extinguished by fire crews. Most reports centered on contents of the facility's movie and video archive.

The loss to the audio contents, in fact, was incalculable, "yet the news has never reached the broader public," reporter Jody Rosen writes. "In part, this represents a triumph of crisis management."

Rosen cites internal emails in which a UMG spokesman informed his superiors, "We stuck to the script about physical backups and digital copies."

Many artists, and their managers, however, would not be assuaged by the argument that digital copies exist -- even though that statement itself was misleading as far as how much of the materials stored at the Hollywood facility had been backed up.

"Neil [Young] would go ballistic," Roberts said, about the official response offered in 2008 and sustained over the years. "If it's not the original analog backup, it's not relevant. When you talk about digital [copies], you're already losing fidelity.

"It's a crime that [the original masters of] Billie Holiday or Buddy Holly or all those artists of the '40s and '50s are gone," Roberts said. "When the music business took a downturn about 15 years ago, people were very reticent to make copies of things, because it costs money. It costs about $2,500 to $3,000 to take an analog master and convert it to high-resolution digital audio. They didn't want to spend the money."

Representatives for some acts whose master recordings were under the UMG umbrella and stored at the Universal Hollywood lot did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the new report.

Texto completo: Convicted, then acquitted of murder, she blames prosecutors, the media
In 2007, an Italian newspaper asked, "Who is Amanda? From brilliant student to cold man-eater."
On Saturday, Amanda Knox, the American exchange student who was twice found guilty and then acquitted of the murder by Italian courts of her British roommate, Meredith Kercher, castigated the media in Italy and sought to reclaim her story in her first trip back to the country since her release from prison in 2011.
"I know a lot of people think I'm bad, that I don't belong to this place," she said in a tearful and defiant speech at a conference on criminal justice in the northern Italian city of Modena. "Some have even claimed that only by being here, by my presence, I am traumatizing the Kercher family again, and profaning Meredith's memory. They are wrong."
(Before the speech, the lawyer for Kercher's family called Knox's invitation to the event "inappropriate" and a "mistake," saying "lawyers for both parts should have been involved," the Associated Press reported.)
A 20-year-old Knox was studying abroad in Perugia in 2007 when the Seattle native was arrested, along with two others, and charged in Kercher's stabbing death. In 2009, she and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murder. Knox spent four years in prison before an appeals court overturned her sentence in 2011, when she returned to the United States. The acquittal was overturned in 2013, and the pair were again convicted in 2014. The following year, their convictions were overturned by Italy's highest appeals court.
Rudy Guede, another suspect who was later convicted of Kercher's murder, is serving a 16-year sentence, the AP reported.
Speaking in Italian on a panel titled "Trial by Media," Knox said on Saturday that, despite her acquittal, she knows she is still a "controversial figure for the public opinion, especially in Italy," the New York Times reported.
The 31-year-old blamed prosecutors and the media for creating a version of her that suited their story.
"To the world, I wasn't a suspect innocent until proven guilty, I was a cunning, psychopathic, dirty, drugged-up whore who was guilty until proven otherwise," she said, according to Reuters.
The story attracted global media attention, spawning salacious headlines such as "Dead Girl Feared Knoxy's Sex Toy" and "Took Part in Sex Attack" that glommed on to allegations of "orgies and sex toys."
Knox arrived in Italy on Thursday but declined to conduct interviews ahead of her panel appearance, instead sharing an online essay in which she discussed her attempt to reclaim her narrative and space in the public sphere, including establishing a presence on social media.
"I just wanted to have what every other person around me had, the freedom to shout into the wind and say, 'Here I am!' The freedom to strike up an unexpected conversation with a friendly digital stranger," she writes.
Knox has taken other steps over the years to share her side of the story. In 2013, Knox published "Waiting to Be Heard," a memoir of her experience in Italy's criminal justice system. She appeared in a 2016 Netflix documentary about her case and hosts a podcast, "The Truth About True Crime," which focuses on wrongful-conviction cases.
During her speech, Knox wept when recalling a prison visit by her father, during which he told her she probably would not be released soon. She also talked about her fear of returning to Italy, "of being harassed, of being trapped, and I am afraid that new accusations will be made just because I have come here to give my version of the facts," according to Reuters.
She remembered Perugia prosecutor Giuliano Mignini as "a nightmare figure, a monster whose only goal was to destroy me for no reason," Reuters reported, but had come to see that he had sought justice for Kercher.
"One day I'd like to meet the real Mignini," she said, according to the AP. "And I hope that when he comes, he will also see that I am not a monster, I simply am Amanda." Knox received a standing ovation.

Texto completo: This simple wisdom — “Fans don’t boo nobodies” — is courtesy the pinstriped philosopher Reggie Jackson, and it resonates for anyone who has ever been in the public sphere.
Put yourself out there and the cranks crank it up. In the end, they’re still cranks.
When you are being noticed, it’s because you have become a cause for concern, for somebody.
So that’s how I realized early this month that the formerly minor character known as Mayor Pete has become a serious cause for concern for the Republican National Committee as it continues its unethical quest to re-elect the president.
How did I realize this? Because the RNC told me so.
On June 3, its Christiana Purves sent me an email: “Good evening — With less than a month to go before the first 2020 Democrat Presidential debate, we’re still only scratching the surface of truly learning about lesser-vetted candidates like Pete Buttigieg. Unfortunately for Mayor Pete, the more we learn, Californians are more likely to see that he was a lousy Mayor who’s struggling to keep up with the pace of presidential politics.”
Then Purves goes on to cite an odd selection of stories from what the Grand Old Party on a normal day, when it didn’t suit its needs, would term the lamestream media.
“‘I ain’t ever seen the dude’ — Residents of South Bend’s poor neighborhoods say Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg left them behind,” the RNC quotes CNBC as saying. Oh, how the GOP is in touch with America’s troubled urban youth. And then: “Buttigieg is only top 2020 presidential candidate not offering staffers health care yet.” Ha ha ha. The former deputy press secretary for Trump buddy Sen. Lindsey Graham concerned a Democratic longshot is not yet being able to afford benefits for his ragtag staff? Ha ha ha.
But with the RNC concerned enough about the guy to start doing a lot of opposition research and sending it out to members of the press, maybe he’s not such a longshot, what?
I have by no means figured out who stands the best chance of preventing the global disaster that would be a second term for this president. No one has stood out in particular from the clearly too many candidates clogging the opposition field. Too bad a gutsy moderate Republican won’t come forward to take advantage of the ridiculously tainted incumbent.
The latest poll of California Democratic voters goes: Biden 22, Sanders 17, Harris 13, Warren 18, Buttigieg 10, O’Rourke 3.
So, only 10 percent of California’s Democratic voters right now say Buttigieg is their main man. Or, to look at it another way, a guy who otherwise just leads the fourth-largest city in Indiana is in fifth place among voters in the nation’s largest state. And this sudden GOP attention would lead us to believe that’s fifth place with a bullet. Harvard and Oxford graduate, former Navy Reserve lieutenant who served in Afghanistan — nice resume. Oh, and he’s gay. And he’s getting noticed — pollsters say awareness of Buttigieg shot up from 4% to 48% in the last six months.
Still actually a stretch, though. The problematical guy who is for some reason not a longshot, Joe Biden, is the frontrunner who is really giving the incumbent conniption fits. The president’s own campaign pollster came to him with numbers from a 17-state survey showing Trump losing to Biden in states that he needs to win, including Texas (sweet!), Michigan and Pennsylvania. After seeing the polls, the president told aides to deny them, Annie Karmin reports in The New York Times.
Biden is “Sleepy Joe” to Trump.
What’s he gonna call Buttigieg when the going gets rough on down the road?

Texto completo: Nueva York hizo historia ayer al convertirse en la primera ciudad del país en destinar fondos de su presupuesto a la atención del aborto.
La ciudad otorgará $250 mil dólares del presupuesto del año fiscal 2020 al Fondo de Acceso al Aborto de Nueva York (NYAAF), una organización que proporciona recursos y asistencia financiera a las personas que no pueden pagar un aborto y que viven o viajan a este estado, informó The New York Times.
Scott Stringer, contralor de NYC , destacó en un comunicado publicado el viernes en Twitter que aunque el aborto es legal en la ciudad, el acceso no siempre ha sido equitativo.
“Estoy orgulloso de que este año el presupuesto proporcionará una victoria progresiva e histórica para los neoyorquinos, y para nuestro país. Es el camino correcto para que la ciudad de Nueva York lidere a la nación “, escribió Stringer.
La medida se produce cuando varios estados trabajan para aprobar leyes que restringirían el acceso al aborto o lo harían ilegal en casi todos los casos.
También ayer, el tribunal federal de Apelaciones del Distrito de Columbia dictaminó que el gobierno de Trump no puede impedir que las inmigrantes menores de edad y las detenidas por las autoridades tengan acceso a abortos.
Abortion is legal in New York, but access hasn’t been equitable.
Today, we take a step forward by providing direct funding for abortion care in the City budget.
I’m proud to have stood with @AMillerNIRH to make this a reality.

Tubman $20 bill redesign well underway before Trump administration delay, report says

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The work to redesign the $20 bill and affix an image of Harriet Tubman as its centerpiece was well underway before the Trump administration delayed the plans, according to a report from the New York Times.
Efforts to redesign the bill were advanced enough for officials at the Secret Service and government engravers to review a metal engraving plate and a digital image of the Tubman mock-up as recently as May 2018, the report said.
The report cited current and former sources at the Treasury Department, which oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The Times also included a preliminary image it obtained from a former Treasury official, completed in late 2016, of what a new $20 bill could look like, featuring Tubman "in a dark coat with a wide collar and a white scarf," the report said.
The bureau disputed these events and said new Secret Service agents routinely visit the bureau for training purposes. "A training class would never be in the position to review a preliminary currency design, let alone something advanced," a spokesman said.
A delay in the redesign of the $20 bill was motivated by concerns of a potential backlash from President Trump, according to the Times report: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chose a timeline extending beyond Trump's presidency to avoid the possibility of an explosive controversy, fearing that the president who has disparaged the redesign would cancel the plans altogether.
In a statement to the Washington Post on Friday, Mnuchin said the development of security and anti-counterfeiting measures first dictates the redesign process.
"In the case of the $20 bill, that timetable is consistent with the previous Administration and has not been changed," Mnuchin wrote. "As Secretary, my first responsibility is to ensure all security and anti-counterfeiting measures are properly taken in accordance with BEP's mandates. The suggestion that this process is being stalled is completely erroneous."
The director of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Len Olijar said in a statement that "No Bureau or Department official has 'scrapped' anything; it is too early to develop an integrated concept or design until security features are finalized." He added, "Everything remains on the table."
Last month, Mnuchin announced that Tubman would not replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill next year, a planned change initiated by the treasury secretary in the Obama administration that carried historical significance. Tubman, a 19th-century abolitionist leader, was destined to take the lofty position from the nation's seventh president, a slaveholder.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
News may be the first draft of history, but I've always viewed the past as a vault, ajar and beckoning with secrets that resonate in current events.
That's how I managed a front-page story on the quadricentennial of Henry Hudson's visit to what became his namesake river in 1609. I discovered not only that the first known murder in New York was recorded in the ship's log, but also that the case against the accused killer amounted to an early example of racial profiling (he was an Indian). In the account I quoted, the suspect was never identified by name. The victim was barely mentioned.
Last week, I wrote another article about a previously unreported death. This time, the subject had died only seven years ago. But his obituary became front page news on Sunday for several reasons: he had died of natural causes, which, given his volcanic lifestyle, was anomalous; he had been prominent for years, yet died unnoticed; and his name was Nicky Barnes.
In the 1970s, Leroy Nicholas Barnes was the notorious de facto incarnation of Ron O'Neal in Gordon Parks Jr.'s 1972 film "Super Fly." Mr. Barnes was the flamboyant dope peddler who flooded Harlem and other black neighborhoods with heroin, led cops on frivolous 100 m.p.h. car chases and redefined bling.
He cavalierly posed in 1977 for a New York Times Magazine cover article that, in effect, validated his folkloric moniker as "Mr. Untouchable" and challenged the authorities not only to arrest him -- which they had already done repeatedly -- but to imprison him for life.
His smug catch-me-if-you-can arrogance so infuriated President Jimmy Carter that the White House ordered the Justice Department to double down on its pending prosecution of Mr. Barnes. A jury convicted Mr. Barnes later that year in a wide-ranging drug conspiracy case and a judge sentenced him to life in prison.
I covered Nicky Barnes in the 1970s. I also knew his chief rival, Frank Lucas. These guys could be shrewd and witty when they wanted to be. They were self-made men. They justified their careers by insisting that they were satisfying a popular demand, and that if they didn't, someone else would. They survived only because they brutally eliminated their competition.
I interviewed Frank Lucas several times in the mid-'70s -- including in the Times cafeteria -- for a possible book. He was larger than life, though perhaps not quite as big as his ego and his imagination. He told spellbinding stories about stashing heroin in the false bottoms of coffins being shipped to the United States from Vietnam, and about the bloody burlesque of a Harlem heroin dealer and his Country Boys crew.
A number of publishers told me that no one would want to read a book about a boastful black dope peddler. A generation later though, Mr. Lucas's notoriety was magnified in a New York magazine article by Mark Jacobson, which in 2007 became a book and movie called "American Gangster," starring Denzel Washington as Mr. Lucas and Cuba Gooding Jr. in a small role as Mr. Barnes.
Mr. Lucas loved it. Nicky Barnes didn't. He was so appalled at being eclipsed that he struck pre-emptively.
Mr. Barnes had, indeed, been sentenced to life imprisonment in 1978, but by the early 1980s he could no longer reconcile life in the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., with his former high life in Manhattan. Feeling betrayed by his former cronies, including the mother of his two daughters, he turned government informer. In 1998, he was released into the federal witness protection program and given a new identity.
A few months before the film and book about Mr. Lucas were released, Mr. Barnes agreed to emerge from the anonymity of his government-granted protective persona for an interview with me to promote both "Mr. Untouchable," a book he wrote with Tom Folsom, and a documentary by the same name.
Our interview almost ended before it began when he was delayed by a freak snowstorm. We met in a motel, then went to dinner. His bravado had largely evaporated. He told his neighbors he was a bankrupt businessman. He worked at a Walmart. After the meal, he asked our waitress to pack his leftover grilled salmon in a doggy bag.
"In the old days," he said meekly, "I would've been embarrassed."
Frank Lucas died last month. When I read his obituary, prepared in advance by Robert McFadden, I wondered: Whatever happened to Nicky Barnes?
The United States Marshals Service does not release progress reports on the convicts-turned-informers like Mr. Barnes whom it safeguards in its witness protection program. I called Sterling Johnson Jr., a federal judge and former special narcotics prosecutor in New York City. "Nicky? He used to call me all the time," the judge said, "but I haven't heard from him in years."
Several other former prosecutors said the same. Finally, one confirmed Mr. Barnes's death, as well as the year and the cause. Mr. Barnes's daughter, who remembered me from the 2007 interview, also confirmed his death.
If we had reported Nicky Barnes's death promptly, chances are it would have appeared on the inside obituary page, like Frank Lucas's. But Nicky got the last laugh. Unlike Mr. Lucas, the news about Mr. Untouchable's ultimate vanishing act landed on Page One.

Moved From One Shelter to Another, and Not Knowing Why

Patrice Joseph believed she was singled out when she complained about cigarette smoke and plumbing problems at the homeless shelter where she and her teenage son and daughter lived in Jamaica, Queens.
Within days last month, the family was moved to a shelter in the Bronx. Ms. Joseph, who had two jobs, said she lost a position at a Queens pharmaceutical manufacturing company because she was often late for work or absent.
"This affects our day-to-day more than people imagine," Ms. Joseph, 38, said. At her request, she was then moved to a third shelter, in Briarwood, Queens, she said.
More than 130,000 people stay in the city's sprawling shelter system annually. Placements are based on what is available, and the city says it must sometimes move people to protect safety and health. But for years, many shelter residents have complained about being moved for seemingly no reason, while being given little notice or a chance to appeal.
New numbers seem to back up their concerns.
Out of more than 24,000 transfer requests between 2014 and 2018, almost 17,000 were "administrative," a term that is supposed to be used for emergencies, according to Safety Net Activists, an organization seeking better treatment of low-income people that received the numbers from the city's public advocate's office. The organization released the numbers on Thursday.
Advocates for homeless people have long argued the city has been overusing administrative transfers as emergencies to skirt a policy that requires shelter residents to receive 48 hours' notice and the right to appeal if transfers are involuntary.
Only 12 of the 24,000 transfers were listed as involuntary.
"It sort of confirmed to us the experience of everyone," said Helen Strom, a community organizer with Safety Net Activists. "Sometimes, people are just given a MetroCard and told to carry their belongings in a trash bag."
Sending people from shelter to shelter -- including between boroughs -- runs counter to the city's goal of providing stability to people who are homeless. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Steven Banks, the commissioner of social services, have a five-year plan to open 90 new shelters, with the goal of placing people in their neighborhoods and close to anchors such as schools and extended family.
Mr. Banks said most transfers occur in an effort to improve conditions for the residents and to meet the needs of a shelter system responsible for thousands of people each night. "The vast majority of our staff are making hard calls every hour of every day," he said.
Mr. Banks added that client records were confidential, so he could not comment on why a specific individual was moved.
The city has had difficulty getting an accurate picture of the reasons for all transfers because the database that tracks them is outdated and contains inaccurate or incomplete entries, said Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the city's Department of Homeless Services.
At a City Council hearing in December, Mr. Banks said he could not immediately provide the Council with transfer data.
The city plans to spend $ 13 million to overhaul the database. But people living in shelters say the overhaul should start with the transfers themselves, which sometimes feel arbitrary, retaliatory or carried out with indifference.
Last year, a bundle of legislation aimed at accountability and transparency in shelter transfers was introduced in the City Council and could go to a vote as early as this summer.
One bill would require that shelter residents be given the specific reasons for a nonemergency transfer, in addition to 48 hours' notice. Another would require the city to post signs inside shelters explaining the appeal process. A third would require the city to publicly report the number of people transferred with 72 hours' notice or less, and to provide the reasons.
Mr. McGinn said the data provided to the Safety Net Activists was raw, was incomplete and included transfer requests that were never carried out.
He provided The New York Times with data showing more than 37,000 completed transfers between 2014 and 2018. Analyzing the type of transfers was difficult since, for example, employees did not complete paperwork more than a third of the time and the rest were all called "administrative," suggesting a problem in the system of documentation.
Dejana Yard, 26, said she successfully fought an administrative transfer last year after staff at a shelter in Brooklyn tried to move her out. Ms. Yard, who said she has anxiety, had permission to have a dog as emotional support; her 9-year-old daughter, who also has mental health problems, had a cat. Ms. Yard said she believed a dispute about the pets with staff members led them to try to move her.
"Two hours later, I was served with transfer papers," she said. "It's like one, two, three, bam, you're out of here."
She declined to sign the papers and reached out to the Legal Aid Society, which resolved the matter. Ms. Yard and her three children remained in the shelter, along with their cat, Anastasia, and dog, Bella, until they moved into an apartment.
Other shelter residents said some transfers may make sense on paper, but do not work in reality.
Benny Masondo, 26, and his fiancée, Laura Cummings, reached out to the Legal Aid Society this month. The couple and Mr. Masondo's 13-year-old sister entered the shelter system about two years ago after he lost a fight with the New York City Housing Authority to stay in an apartment in Harlem that was leased to a late relative.
The family was first placed in a shelter in the Bronx. That shelter was closed under a city plan to eliminate so-called cluster apartments, which are private apartments used as shelter units. A year later, they were placed in another cluster shelter in Harlem, and Mr. Masondo said he was grateful because it put him closer to his doctor in Lower Manhattan.
Mr. Masondo, who has epilepsy, said he signed a request for an apartment in subsidized housing for people with chronic illnesses. He said that document was used to transfer his family to another shelter to accommodate his medical condition.
The new shelter had air-conditioning, which the couple believed the city thought would help Mr. Masondo's condition. But the air-conditioner was initially broken and the shelter unit was a studio, meaning the small family no longer had any privacy. It also lacked a refrigerator with a freezer and meant a longer train ride to Mr. Masondo's doctor and his sister's school.
"The system really looks at us as a number," Ms. Cummings, 22, said.
Mr. Masondo's 13-year-old sister, who asked that her name not be disclosed because of the stigma of homelessness at her school, was recently honored as the top student in her seventh-grade class. She participates in several after-school activities, including the debate team.
"When I had a room, I could sit and paint," the girl said. "I don't like moving because I've been moving my whole life. I just want to move somewhere nice."

Texto completo: Yet More on Jewish Values
JEWISH VALUES ARE neither conservative nor liberal, neither Democratic nor Republican ("Letters," June 6). The sad fact is that there are no "Jewish values" anymore; rather, there is an amorphous salad of disparate disconnected opinions.
Some think abortion right up to birth and beyond, free health care, Trump derangement syndrome, open borders, radical environmentalism are all right there clearly written in the Bible, but so far nobody can show me where.
Not too long ago, I thought all Jews saw supporting Israel's survival as a Jewish value, but even that is no longer true. The fact is you can no longer demand obeisance to any belief from your fellow Jews, regardless of how important it is to you. Politics has become so toxic, so deranged, so malignant and emotional that just the fact that we disagree on almost any topic sends some of us into a fury.
Here's the bottom line: There are people out there who want us all dead, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican, and your opinions on anything won't change their minds. Let's agree to disagree without being disagreeable.

Blintz Offense
I love ice cream and enjoyed "The Great Dairy Investigation of 2019" (June 6), but I was disappointed that what I think is the prime dairy dish of Shavuot - cheese blintzes - did not get one mention. All dairy restaurants had it on the top of every menu and, in fact, a short-lived one in Philly was named after that wonderful and tasty entree.
Maybe it is because such restaurants do not exist anymore or that the staff could not find anywhere else where it may be served. At least I hope that there are those who make it at home. I would hate to see it disappear.
Leon Kellerman | Philadelphia
Trump Is Great
I am concerned at your analysis of the Jewish vote in the May 30 Exponent ("Jewish Voters Concerned With Domestic Issues Ahead of 2020") and the negativity toward Trump that it shows.
I am a 92-year-old Jewish man who has always been active in Jewish affairs and after eight years of Obama, Trump is like a breath of fresh air. Trump's own daughter, Ivanka, married Jared Kushner and became Jewish by taking his religion. Kushner is now one of Trump's closest advisors. Contrary to prior presidents, Trump moved the American embassy to Jerusalem. When he became president, he got us out of the Iran treaty. Iran had been using monies they received from the treaty to arm Hamas and Hezbollah.
While The New York Times published anti-Semitic cartoons, and the Democrats refused to criticize Congresswomen Omar and Tlaib for their anti-Jewish rhetoric, Trump has been loyal to the Jewish electorate. *

Trump Says He'd Accept Foreign Dirt On a Rival

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump said on Wednesday that there would be nothing wrong with accepting incriminating information about an election opponent from Russia or other foreign governments and that he saw no reason to call the F.B.I. if it were to happen again.
"It's not an interference," he said in an interview with ABC News, describing it as "opposition research." "They have information -- I think I'd take it." He would call the F.B.I. only "if I thought there was something wrong."
His comments put him at odds not only with Democratic candidates who have made a point of forswearing help from foreign governments as they seek their party's nomination to challenge him but also with his own F.B.I. director, Christopher S. Wray, who has said politicians in such circumstances should call his agency.
"I don't think in my whole life I've ever called the F.B.I. In my whole life," Mr. Trump said dismissively. "You don't call the F.B.I. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you do." He added, "Give me a break -- life doesn't work that way."
When the interviewer, George Stephanopoulos, noted that the F.B.I. director has said a candidate should call, Mr. Trump snapped, "The F.B.I. director is wrong."
The president's remarks came on the same day that his son Donald Trump Jr. appeared on Capitol Hill to answer questions from lawmakers. During the 2016 campaign, the younger Mr. Trump -- along with Jared Kushner, the future president's son-in-law, and Paul Manafort, then his campaign chairman -- met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer after being told she would have "dirt" on Hillary Clinton as "part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump."
The president has previously defended the decision to take the meeting on the grounds that any campaign would listen to opposition research, even from a foreign adversary. Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, concluded in his recent report that Russia made a concerted effort to help Mr. Trump get elected and that Mr. Trump's campaign benefited from it, but he established no illegal conspiracy between the two.
Mr. Trump has sought to characterize Mr. Mueller's report as complete exoneration. He took it a step further on Wednesday during an earlier meeting with reporters when he claimed that Mr. Mueller's report actually said that "we rebuffed them" when the Russians tried to help.
Mr. Trump's lawyer did not respond to a request asking what the president was referring to. In actuality, Mr. Mueller's report documented numerous contacts between Mr. Trump's campaign and Russian figures throughout the 2016 campaign.
In testimony to Congress last month, Mr. Wray, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, said campaigns should report it if they hear from foreign governments. "I think my view is that if any public official or member of any campaign is contacted by any nation state or anybody acting on behalf of a nation state about influencing or interfering with our election, then that's something that the F.B.I. would want to know about," Mr. Wray said.
When pressed during the interview, Mr. Trump allowed that maybe he would call the F.B.I. but only after listening to the incriminating information first. "I think maybe you do both," he said, adding: "There's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country, Norway, 'we have information on your opponent' -- oh, I think I'd want to hear it."
His answer mirrored one given recently by Mr. Kushner, who said he was not sure he would call the F.B.I. if a foreign government again offered damaging information about an opponent. "I don't know," he said in an interview with Axios, an online news organization. "It's hard to do hypotheticals, but the reality is is that we were not given anything that was salacious."
It was the second time in recent weeks that Mr. Trump has publicly chided Mr. Wray. After the F.B.I. director rejected the word "spying" to describe the bureau's investigation of contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, Mr. Trump lashed out. "I thought it was a ridiculous answer," Mr. Trump said last month.
Mr. Trump on Wednesday also disputed an article in The New York Times reporting that his internal polling showed him trailing Democrats in key states. "We are winning in every single state that we polled," he told reporters in the Oval Office. "We're winning in Texas very big, we're winning in Ohio very big. We're winning in Florida very big. They were fake polls that were either put out by the corrupt media."
Mr. Trump's claim to Mr. Stephanopoulos that he never in his life called the F.B.I. conflicts with past reports. In 2017, BuzzFeed reported on a 1981 F.B.I. memo that described how Mr. Trump, as a real estate developer, contacted the bureau about a casino he was considering opening in Atlantic City. He offered to "fully cooperate" with the bureau and suggested that F.B.I. agents work undercover in the casino to root out any mafia elements.

Texto completo: Mindy Kaling isn't planning on sharing the identity of her daughter Katherine 's father with the world anytime soon.
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine, the Cambridge native revealed why she has stayed mum about the mystery man so far.
“My feeling is that until I speak to my daughter about that, I'm not going to talk to anyone else about it," Kaling told the magazine.
Despite writing two memoirs and a self-titled sitcom, Kaling, whose new film “Late Night" hits theaters on Friday, also said she doesn't necessarily have plans to use her life experiences as a new mom as comedic fodder.
“I could write stories about mothers, about my relationship with my daughter — but I don't know. It gets so 'Postcards From the Edge,"' Kaling said, referring to the late actress Carrie Fisher 's 1987 semi-autobiographical novel.
“I think people are often surprised that for someone who seems as open as I am on social media and who writes things that seem drawn from my life, I find that stuff really private."

Texto completo: Republican Rep. Steve King was reportedly not allowed to fly on Air Force One after President Trump visited his home state of Iowa Tuesday.
The controversial representative who represents a district in the western part of the state asked the White House to join the delegation flying on Trump’s jet but was denied a seat aboard Air Force One, according to CNN.
Republican Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa and Deb Fischer of Nebraska joined the president on the iconic jet in addition to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and others.
Republicans stripped King, 70, of his committee assignments after he was roundly rebuked for remarks he made during a January New York Times interview that were seen as racist. King claims the comments were misinterpreted.
“White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?” King said in the interview. “Why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and our civilization?”
King is facing a primary challenge from Iowa state Sen. Randy Feenstra, who outraised him by a large margin during the first quarter of the year.

A SALAD WITH FRIED ASPARAGUS

Texto completo: Farmers markets typically start slowly, with only a handful of fruits and vegetables on display. One early find that doesn't last long is asparagus, which is prized both for its light flavor and versatility.
The spears and stalks can be steamed, boiled, stir-fried, grilled or eaten raw in a salad or with a dip.
Perhaps no one does vegetables better than Yotam Ottolenghi, whose New York Times bestseller "Ottolenghi Simple" was a 2019 James Beard Awards finalist for general cookbooks. It pairs fried asparagus with kale in a mustard vinaigrette, with candied seeds on top for crunch.
Kale and grilled asparagus salad
3 tablespoons pumpkin seeds
3 tablespoons chopped almonds
1½ teaspoon maple syrup, divided
Salt and black pepper
9 ounces kale, stems discarded, leaves torn into roughly 2-inch pieces
2 large handfuls baby spinach
3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1½ tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons wholegrain mustard
1 pound asparagus, trimmed
3 tablespoons tarragon leaves, roughly chopped
3 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped
Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Mix almonds and pumpkin seeds with half a teaspoon of maple syrup, a pinch of salt and a good grind of pepper, then spread out on a small oven tray lined with baking paper. Cook in oven for 12 minutes, until they are golden brown, then set aside for about 20 minutes, during which time they will clump together and crisp up as they cool. Once cool, break the almonds and pumpkin seeds into small pieces.
Put kale and spinach in a large bowl with remaining teaspoon of maple syrup, 2 tablespoons of oil, vinegar, mustard and ¼ teaspoon of salt.
Using your hands, mix together and massage the kale for about a minute, until it softens and takes on flavors of the marinade. Set aside for at least half an hour (or up to 4 hours, if you want to get ahead).
Warm a tablespoon of oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat and, when hot, add asparagus and a good pinch of salt, and fry for 6 minutes, turning regularly so it starts to brown and soften. Leave to cool, then cut on an angle into 1-inch long pieces.
To serve, toss herbs into kale, then spread out on a large platter. Top with asparagus, almonds and pumpkin seeds, and serve at once.
Serves 4.

Texto completo: The four-part Netflix drama "When They See Us," created, co-written and directed by noted African American filmmaker Ava DuVernay, has again turned the spotlight on the unjust conviction of the "Central Park Five."
Five teenagers, four black and one Hispanic, were found guilty of raping a white jogger in Central Park in 1990. They were exonerated 12 years later, after they had served prison sentences and after a serial rapist confessed to the crime.
The miniseries and the conversation around it have treated the Central Park Five story as a simple tale of the evil of white racism. Racial stereotyping was a factor in the injustice that was done. But it was far more complicated. What happened was also a result of media frenzy and heightened sensitivity toward sex crimes - including feminist outrage at violence against women.
When the jogger, a 28-year-old investment banker (who, years later, identified herself as Trisha Meili) was found unconscious, beaten and raped in Central Park in spring 1989, the news shook a city coping with rampant crime. The boys who were arrested - Korey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam and Raymond Santana - were to some extent casualties of a societal tendency to see young black males as potential criminals. But it is also true they were part of a loose group of about 30 East Harlem teens who were in Central Park that night attacking random bicyclists and joggers.
This doesn't mean they attacked Meili. Indeed, circumstantial evidence indicates they were elsewhere in the park. The boys' soon-retracted confessions, riddled with inconsistencies, are now almost universally seen as the result of police coercion and manipulation. There was no forensic evidence tying them to the act.
In 2001, Matias Reyes, a murderer and rapist serving a life sentence for other crimes, confessed to raping and beating Meili; his statement was confirmed by DNA and other crime scene evidence.
Why were the teens convicted, despite what should have been plenty of reasonable doubt? (Veteran journalist Joan Didion noted the weaknesses in the case back in 1991.) Mainly because media coverage and public emotion created an accusation-equals-guilt mindset.
Racial stereotypes played a role. But notably, the year before the Central Park rape, a white woman, Margaret Kelly Michaels, was convicted of molesting 20 children at a New Jersey day care center and sentenced to 47 years in prison in a case that also generated intense emotion. A later review found that the children were heavily pressured to "disclose" abuse and that the acts imputed to Michaels, whose conviction was overturned in 1993, were highly implausible.
In the Central Park case, the jogger became a symbol for female victims of male violence, while Linda Fairstein, then the head of the Manhattan district attorney's sex crimes unit, and Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer were hailed as heroic feminist avengers. After Lederer won the first three convictions, a New York journalist gloated that the defendants "were nailed by a woman," something that could have never "crossed their vicious minds." The writer was not a fearmongering white reactionary but Bob Herbert, a respected, progressive black columnist for the Daily News (and later The New York Times) who wrote often on racial issues.
Today, the wheel has turned, and the now-retired Fairstein, who opposed vacating the five men's convictions in 2002, has gone from hero to pariah, dropped by her book publisher and booted from several boards of directors. But the sex-crime panic and the presumed-guilty mentality are still with us. The Central Park Five story is a cautionary tale about that, too.

THE COMING GOP APOCALYPSE REPUBLICANS ARE STUMBLING INTO THE AGE OF DIVERSITY AND FACE A GENERATION GAP OF EPIC PROPORTIONS

Texto completo: For much of the 20th century, young and old people voted pretty similarly. The defining gaps in our recent politics have been the gender gap (women preferring Democrats) and the education gap. But now the generation gap is back, with a vengeance. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8819">
This is most immediately evident in the way Democrats are sorting themselves in their early primary preferences. A Democratic voter's race, sex or education level doesn't predict which candidate he or she is leaning toward, but age does.
In one early New Hampshire poll, Joe Biden won 39 percent of the vote of those over 55, but just 22 percent of those under 35, trailing Bernie Sanders. Similarly, in an early Iowa poll, Mr. Biden won 41 percent of the oldster vote, but just 17 percent of the young adult vote, placing third, behind Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.
As Ronald Brownstein pointed out in The Atlantic, older Democrats prefer a more moderate candidate who they think can win. Younger Democrats prefer a more progressive candidate who they think can bring systemic change.
The generation gap is even more powerful when it comes to Republicans. To put it bluntly, young adults hate them.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8824">
In 2018, voters under 30 supported Democratic House candidates over Republican ones by an astounding 67 percent to 32 percent. A 2018 Pew survey found that 59 percent of millennial voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, while only 32 percent identify as Republicans or lean Republican.
The difference is ideological. According to Pew, 57 percent of millennials call themselves consistently liberal or mostly liberal. Only 12 percent call themselves consistently conservative or mostly conservative. This is the most important statistic in American politics right now.
Recent surveys of Generation Z voters (those born after 1996) find that, if anything, they are even more liberal than millennials.
In 2002, John B. Judis and Ruy Teixeira wrote a book called "The Emerging Democratic Majority," which predicted electoral doom for the GOP based on demographic data. That prediction turned out to be wrong, or at least wildly premature.
The authors did not foresee how older white voters would swing over to the Republican side and the way many assimilated Hispanics would vote like non-Hispanic whites. The failure of that book's predictions has scared people off from making demographic forecasts.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8830">
But it's hard to look at the generational data and not see long-term disaster for Republicans. Some people think generations get more conservative as they age, but that is not borne out by the evidence. Moreover, today's generation gap is not based just on temporary intellectual postures. It is based on concrete, lived experience that is never going to go away.
Unlike the Silent Generation and the boomers, millennials and Gen Z voters live with difference every single day. Only 16 percent of the Silent Generation is minority, but 44 percent of the millennial generation is. If you are a millennial in California, Texas, Florida, Arizona or New Jersey, ethnic minorities make up more than half of your age cohort. In just over two decades, America will be a majority-minority country.
Young voters approve of these trends. Seventy-nine percent of millennials think immigration is good for America. Sixty-one percent think racial diversity is good for America.
They have constructed an ethos that is mostly about dealing with difference. They are much more sympathetic to those who identify as transgender. They are much more likely than other groups to say that racial discrimination is the main barrier to black progress. They are much less likely to say the U.S. is the best country in the world.
These days, the Republican Party looks like a direct reaction against this ethos - against immigration, against diversity, against pluralism. Moreover, conservative thought seems to be getting less relevant to the America that is coming into being.
Matthew Continetti recently identified the key blocs on the new right in an essay in The Washington Free Beacon. These included the Jacksonians (pugilistic populists), the Paleos (Tucker Carlson-style economic nationalists) and the Post-Liberals (people who oppose pluralism and seek a return to pre-Enlightenment orthodoxy). To most young adults, these tendencies will look like cloud cuckooland.
The most burning question for conservatives should be: What do we have to say to young adults and about the diverse world they are living in? Instead, conservative intellectuals seem hellbent on taking their 12% share among the young and turning it to 3.
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="8838">
The conservative way to embrace pluralism and diversity is to point out that there is a deep strain of pessimism in progressive multiculturalism: Blacks and whites will never really understand each other; racism is endemic; the American project is fatally flawed; American structures are so oppressive, the only option is to burn them down.
A better multiculturalism would be optimistic: We can communicate across difference; the American creed is the right recipe for a thick and respectful pluralism; American structures are basically sound and can be realistically reformed.
So far that's not visible. My mentor William F. Buckley Jr. vowed to stand athwart history yelling "Stop!" Today's Republicans don't even seem to see the train that is running them over.

Over 180 CEOs sign letter against abortion restrictions

Texto completo: More than 180 CEOs signed an open letter opposing state efforts to restrict reproductive rights, as business leaders weigh how to most effectively exert pressure on abortion bans.
Square Chief Executive and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as well as fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg and others wrote that restrictions on abortion access threatens the economic stability of their employees and customers, and makes it harder to build a diverse workforce and recruit talent.
The letter, which appeared Monday as a full-page ad in The New York Times, marks the business community's latest foray into a polarizing societal issue. The chief executives of Bloomberg News, Atlantic Records, Yelp and Warby Parker, among others, aligned themselves with such national organizations as Planned Parenthood, NARAL Pro-Choice America, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights.
The move also comes nearly four weeks after Alabama signed off on the nation's most restrictive abortion law. Other states, including Georgia, have adopted similar laws.
"As anti-choice politicians are escalating attacks on these fundamental freedoms, we encourage the entire business community to join us in protecting access to reproductive health care in the critical months and years to come," Ilyse Hogue, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, said in a statement.
Georgia's law, signed last month by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat can be detected, which typically occurs near the six-week mark and before many women even know they are pregnant. Alabama banned virtually all abortions in the state - including for victims of rape and incest.
Several industries have moved to exert pressure on states that limit access to abortion. Some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Walt Disney and WarnerMedia, have suggested that they might pull their business from Georgia if its new law survives a court challenge. Filmmaking is a $9.5 billion industry in Georgia that created more than 92,000 jobs last year, according to a McKinsey study.
But even among the law's staunch objectors, there isn't a clear consensus on how companies should respond. Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost Georgia's gubernatorial race last year, is urging Hollywood to keep its business in the state, saying a boycott would only strip working-class people of their jobs with no guarantee it would reverse the new law.
Instead, Abrams and other business leaders are launching a "#StayAndFight" campaign encouraging Hollywood powerhouses to put their money behind political groups challenging the state's law. Film industry workers are also organizing against any potential boycott and are raising money for a challenge to the law by the ACLU.
Businesses that threaten to take their business elsewhere often have the sharpest influence, said Timothy Coombs, a corporate communications expert at Texas A&M University. There may be an initial debate about leaving a country or state altogether, or trying to "change the system from the inside."
Coombs cited companies that cut ties with Indiana over a 2015 law, signed by then-Gov. Mike Pence, that could have made it easier for religious conservatives to deny service to gay couples. At the time, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce.com, said he would cancel all company events in the state. Jeremy Stoppelman, the founder of Yelp, said that "it is unconscionable to imagine that Yelp would create, maintain, or expand a significant business presence in any state that encouraged discrimination."
"To say, 'Oh, we're going to stay and engage,' that's usually pretty hollow," Coombs said. "To say, 'OK, we're going to boycott,' companies need to know that most of their stakeholders are going to support that position."

Texto completo: World
BEIJING - Websites of The Washington Post and the Guardian appear to now be blocked in China as the country's government further tightens its so-called "Great Firewall" censorship apparatus as it navigates a politically sensitive period.
Until this weekend, The Post and the Guardian were among the last few major English-language outlets that were still regularly accessible from mainland China without the use of virtual private networking (VPN) software, according to the censorship tracker greatfire.org.
Chinese internet authorities have gone into overdrive in recent weeks ahead of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre on June 4, 1989, prohibiting users on the popular WeChat social media service to post keywords or pictures related to the event.
All but the most oblique references to the incident were immediately scrubbed and, during the days around the anniversary, users complained about not even being able to access the function to change their avatars.
Every language edition of Wikipedia was fully banned in mid-May. A CNN reporter said the network's website was blocked again this week shortly after CNN.com ran a top story commemorating the 1989 incident.
China's internet censors rarely, if ever, communicate their reasoning for blocking specific websites, and it's not clear whether the ban would be permanent. Although authorities intermittently tighten and loosen their restrictions, the trend since 2013 has shown more and more foreign websites being irrevocably added to China's blacklist.
Outlets such as Bloomberg, the New York Times, Reuters and the Wall Street Journal have been blocked for years. So have social media services such as Facebook and Twitter and all Google-owned services, including YouTube. Other popular services such as Dropbox, Slack and WhatsApp are also prohibited.
The extensive censorship software now blocks more than 10,000 Web domains.
Chinese authorities have said their censorship practices are a matter of the country's "internet sovereignty" and not negotiable with foreign governments. But its officials have gone further in recent years, not only defending their approach to censorship but touting its successes as a model that authoritarian governments around the world could also adopt.
Sudanese begin weeklong strike
KHARTOUM, Sudan - Shops were closed and streets were empty across Sudan on Sunday, the first day of a general strike called for the start of the workweek by protest leaders demanding the resignation of the ruling military council.
The Sudanese Professionals Association urged people to stay home to protest the deadly crackdown last week when security forces violently dispersed the group's main sit-in outside the military headquarters in the capital, Khartoum.
The protesters say more than 100 people have been killed since the crackdown began June 3, including at least four slain by security forces on Sunday.
The protesters hope that their strike and campaign of civil disobedience will force the military to hand over power to civilians. The military leaders ousted longtime President Omar al-Bashir in April after four months of mass rallies. The generals have refused demonstrators' demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement.
The SPA posted photos of what it said was an empty Khartoum International Airport, adding that airport workers and pilots are taking part in the civil disobedience.
Other videos online showed offices and businesses closed and light traffic, in both Khartoum and the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.
SPA activist Dura Gambo said at midday that participation in the general strike "exceeded our expectations."
"All private and some government banks joined the strike. Cities across the country are almost empty," she said.
The internet remains cut off in Khartoum.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and his acting Homeland Security secretary on Sunday defended their new agreement with the Mexican government to curb migration at the southern border, striking back at Democratic critics - including accusations that at least some parts of the deal predated Trump's recent tariff threats.
In a series of tweets, Trump said Mexico "was not being cooperative on the Border" before the deal reached Friday. Now, he said, "I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done."
He also said he could move to reimpose tariffs if Mexico doesn't follow through on its promises. Some aspects of the deal, he added, remain to be announced - "one in particular," he said, "will be announced at the appropriate time."
Meanwhile, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan credited Trump's tariff threats - which would have placed a 5% levy on Mexican goods starting Monday, ratcheting up over several months to as much as 25% - with producing a breakthrough.
"The president put a charge in this whole dialogue with Mexico with the tariff threat, brought them to the table," McAleenan said in a "Fox News Sunday" interview, noting that Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard "arrived within hours" to begin talks.
Mexico announced it would implement "strong measures" to slow the flow of migrants across its territory toward the southern U.S. border, including the deployment of thousands of Mexican national guard troops. It also agreed to expand a program allowing Central American migrants to wait in Mexico while they await the adjudication of their asylum claims.
On Sunday, two Democratic presidential candidates said Trump had exaggerated what his tariff threats against Mexico had accomplished. They echoed a New York Times report alleging that the Mexican government had already agreed to several terms of the deal before Trump publicly floated the prospect of tariffs.
"These are agreements that Mexico had already made, in some cases months ago," former congressman Beto O'Rourke said in an interview on ABC's "This Week." "They might have accelerated the timetable, but by and large the president achieved nothing except to jeopardize the most important trading relationship that the United States of America has."
During an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also said Trump had repackaged earlier agreements with Mexico to declare success in the trade standoff.
"I think what the world is tired of, and what I am tired of, is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies," Sanders said, adding that Trump should focus on achieving comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump, in his tweets, lashed out at The New York Times for suggesting the deal was not entirely new and also pointed out that tariffs could be back on the table if the Mexican government does not honor its end of the deal.
"There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn't exist for decades," he said. "However, if for some unknown reason ... there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs."
McAleenan echoed that sentiment, saying the dangling threat of tariffs amounted to "a mechanism to make sure that they do what they promise to do, that there's an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those (migrant) numbers."
Republican lawmakers appeared relieved in talk-show appearances Sunday.
Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, had voiced anxiety about the tariffs before the deal was reached. On Sunday, he had nothing but praise for Trump.
"Republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on American consumers, and we don't want to see them in place long-term, nor do I believe President Trump does, either," he said on "Fox News Sunday." "He's using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations, and I think he used them as leverage in this situation brilliantly."
Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., speaking on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures," defended Trump.
"Republicans need to provide the president with a lot of leeway," Tillis said, adding that if lawmakers give Trump some "unorthodox" options for negotiating trade agreements, "then America wins."
Top congressional Democrats on Saturday delivered dual attacks on the deal, saying that the agreement amounted to less than meets the eye while also arguing that the tariff threat that prompted it was reckless.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the deal was "likely to be one of the president's typical, bogus solutions" to justify retreat from the tariffs, which had prompted a fierce backlash from business interests and many Republicans.

Texto completo: El presidente Donald Trump tuiteó desde temprana hora acerca el acuerdo con el Gobierno mexicano sobre inmigración, seguridad y materia comercial para evitar aplicar las tarifas de hasta 25% a productos de ese país; destacó que hay un elemento importante que se dará a conocer más adelante.
Los comentarios del mandatario formaron parte de la respuesta al reporte de The New York Times, sobre que los puntos que integran el pacto entre su Administración y la de Andrés Manuel López Obrador fueron cerrados en marzo por la entonces secretaria de Seguridad Nacional, Kirstjen Nielsen , y la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez Cordero .
El mandatario republicano dijo que México no había cooperado con los Estados Unidos adecuadamente, pero ahora tiene completa confianza, especialmente luego de hablar con su homólogo López Obrador.
“Hay algunas cosas importantes que no se mencionaron ayer en el comunicado de prensa, una en particular, sobre la que acordamos” , indicó el presidente en un tuit. “Será anunciada en su debido momento” .
Agregó que ahora existe una gran cooperación entre ambas naciones y recalcó que era algo que no existía “en décadas” por razones desconocidas.
…..not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didn’t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason…
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2019
Las críticas sobre el acuerdo se desataron en ambos países, incluso en voz de la lideresa de la Cámara, Nancy Pelosi .
“Las amenazas y las rabietas no son una forma de negociar la política exterior”, dijo Pelosi en un comunicado el sábado.
Grupos de activistas, como Families Belong Together México consideraron que poner a inmigrantes como un elemento de negociación entre países los coloca en una posición más vulnerable.
“La celebración del acuerdo migratorio entre México y los Estados Unidos en Tijuana no toma en cuenta la desesperación y el sufrimiento de los miles de migrantes que son afectados por las políticas migratorias de Trump. Hemos deshumanizado la migración” , afirmó Soraya Vázquez , directora de Families Belong Together México. “Nos hemos vuelto insensibles frente a una realidad lacerante de miles de niños y familias que deben esperar su proceso de asilo en Tijuana sin seguridad, comida o refugio adecuado”.
El presidente Trump afirmó que México se había comprometido a aumentar la adquisición de productos agrícolas de los Estados Unidos.
Cuestionada al respecto, al Embajadora mexicana, Martha Bárcena , evitó desmentir o reafirmar dicha revelación, aunque destacó que en los últimos cuatro meses el país vecino del sur se convirtió en el socio comercial número uno de EEUU.
En entrevista en el programa Face The Nation de CBS, la Embajadora destacó que con la aprobación del Acuerdo Estados Unidos-México-Canadá (USMCA o T-MEC ) habrá ese incremento.
“Hará un incremento de productos agrículos y manufactureros”, apuntó, pero la entrevistadora Margaret Brennan insistió sobre el mensaje tuiteado por el presidente Trump acerca del incremento en productos agrícolas.
“Ahora somos el segundo comprador de los Estados Unidos en ese sector” , dijo Bárcena. “Tenemos una economía integrada en el sector agrícola”.

El canciller mexicano, Marcelo Ebrard , afirmó que el acuerdo evitó la pérdida hasta de 900,000 empleos en México en forma inmediata, sí como la cancelación del T-MEC.
Sobre los inmigrantes que se enviará a México señaló que se les dará asistencia legal y orientación para laborar en el país, además de registrar todos los extranjeros que busquen llegar a EEUU.
“Necesitamos saber quiénes son, si no, no los podemos proteger” , afirmó.

"No hay tarifas, Presidente, y salimos con la dignidad intacta": @m_ebrard
Evitamos:
→ Caída de inversión
→ Pérdida de más de 900 mil empleos

Texto completo: British pomp, pageantry mark queen's 93rd birthday, officially
LONDON -- Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with the annual Trooping the Colours parade, a traditional display of British pageantry. About 1,400 soldiers in scarlet coats and bearskin hats marched past in a ceremony on Horse Guards Parade in Westminster.
Royals taking part included Prince Charles, Prince William and his wife, Kate, and Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan -- who appeared in her first public outing since giving birth to their son, Archie, to watch the birthday flyby of military aircraft.
Baby Archie did not appear, but another young royal almost stole the queen's limelight when he made his debut on Buckingham Palace's balcony. Prince Louis, 1, the youngest child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, waved frantically at the first sight of helicopters.
The queen marks her birthday twice a year -- an official ceremony is always held in June, in hopes of holding the parade in good weather. Her actual birthday, April 21, is usually celebrated with close family only. She turned 93.
Thousands of spectators lined the parade ground and gathered in nearby St. James's park to watch the spectacle in sparkling sunshine. They then walked down the road leading to Buckingham Palace, gathering at the gates to honor the monarch ahead of the fly-past.
The queen waved and smiled as she emerged on the balcony and the crowd roared.
The ceremony originated from traditional preparations for battle. The colors -- or flags -- were "trooped," or carried down the lines of soldiers, so they could be seen and recognized in battle.

London police arrest 5 teens in alleged attack of women on bus
LONDON-- Five teen boys were under arrest Saturday in connection with an alleged assault on two women who refused to kiss as they were surrounded on a London bus and taunted as lesbians, according to an account by one of the women.
The alleged attack was revealed in social media posts by one of the women, Melania Geymonat.
The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."

US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM -- The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.

Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania -- Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.

Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK -- Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.

Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. -- Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.

Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

A passion for pizza

Texto completo: Joe Calderone knows a thing or two about pizza. His pizza is famous for its unique style: lighter pies with crisp, airy crusts.
"The technical name of it is Neapolitan pizza," said Calderone, who has owned Joe Daddy's Pizza on Del Prado Boulevard North in Cape Coral since 2010. He's just opened a second location at 3015 Pine Island Road – in the Publix plaza at Pine Island and Burnt Store roads.
"But most people never heard of Neapolitan pizza. New York is famous for it. Other places around the country will do it if they have the skill set, but most don't. There's a process to get the pie to come out light and fluffy and still have substance, where you can actually hold it and it's not just a cracker crust on the bottom. It's still got to be brown on the bottom but not burnt."
Calderone should know. He spent three years working in a New Jersey pizzeria as a teenager, watching the pizza makers closely and soaking up their knowledge.
"I worked for a bunch of guys from Italy, and they had the process down pretty well," he said. "I'm pretty sure I've taken what they've taught me, and I've brought it to the next level. That wasn't an easy task."
Though Calderone was destined to make good pizza, he wasn't always in the pizza business. Soon after he started college, his father died, leaving Calderone and his two younger brothers, who were 7 and 11 at the time
"It was like throwing five bags of cement at me and saying: 'Carry them.'"
He dropped out of college and took a job as a meter reader, which he did for the next seven years. Then he became a tool-and-die maker for the next 30 years.
"I got tired of it," he said of reaching the end of his tool-and-die career.
"I figured, people didn't always need their molds made, but they needed to eat."
Calderone wanted his own pizza place, he said, but he never had the guts to pull the trigger. Until he'd finally had enough. That's when he launched Joe Daddy's, right in the middle of the recession.
"We opened at the height of the foreclosure market," he said, "which was a tough thing to do. It was like I stuck a screwdriver straight through my head and could see it come out the other side. But I had this driving confidence that I could make really good pizza."
His confidence was spot-on.
In a market crowded with pizzerias, Joe Daddy's has not only survived, it's thrived.
"We put our customers first," Calderone said.
"We know almost all of our customers on a first-name basis. People want good food, but they also want to be treated kindly and with respect. If you can provide a quality product with an atmosphere that's light and kindhearted, people really don't ask for much more."
Plus, it helps that he has an undeniable passion for pizza.
"I personally think pizza is the most beautiful food in the world. When people eat pizza, they immediately become happy. I don't know any other food that makes people as happy when they eat it."
Calderone has been serving happy customers for nearly a decade, and now with two locations he intends to keep the pies — and that good feeling — going.

The Metropolitan Police announced that four teens had been arrested Friday and said another boy, 16, was arrested Saturday. Police were reviewing footage of the attack.
Geymonat, an Uruguayan flight attendant, said she and her U.S. girlfriend were traveling home on the top deck of a bus to Camden Town, a neighborhood busy with nightlife, on May 30 when they were attacked.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called the incident "a disgusting, misogynistic attack."
US ambassador says Israel can retain parts of the West Bank
JERUSALEM - The U.S. ambassador in Jerusalem says Israel has the right to retain parts, but not all, of the West Bank.
David Friedman's remarks in an interview with The New York Times published Saturday come about two months after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to begin annexing parts of the West Bank.
It's unclear if the ambassador was revealing a component of the long-awaited Trump administration Mideast peace plan.
The Palestinians want statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with a capital in east Jerusalem. Last year, Washington announced it recognized the city as Israel's capital.
Most of the world considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal.
Albania president cites tense climate in canceling elections
TIRANA, Albania - Albanian President Ilir Meta on Saturday canceled upcoming municipal elections, citing the need to reduce political tensions in the country. Meta said he would clarify his decision Monday.
Thousands of Albanians who support the political opposition assembled for an anti-government protest Saturday. The Albanian opposition accuses the government of links to organized crime and vote rigging. The government denies the allegations and said protests that started in February have hurt the country's image as the European Union is set to decide this month whether to launch negotiations to include Albania as a member.
The U.S. and EU urged the opposition to disavow violence and sit with government representatives to resolve the crisis.
Hillary Clinton says youngest brother has died
NEW YORK - Hillary Clinton's youngest brother Tony Rodham died Friday night. The former U.S. senator, secretary of state, first lady and Democratic presidential candidate announced the death Saturday on Twitter.
Clinton remembered her brother as a generous person who could walk into a room and "light it up with laughter."
"It's hard to find words, my mind is flooded with memories of him today," she tweeted.
He was survived by his wife, Megan, and three children, Zach, Simon and Fiona. Tony Rodham was born in 1954 to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham. He was raised in the Chicago suburbs along with his older siblings, Hillary and Hugh.
The youngest Rodham held a variety of jobs, including stints as a prison guard, insurance salesman, repo man, private detective and business investor.
Pickup truck hits Amish carriage, killing 2 kids
ALGANSEE TOWNSHIP, Mich. - Authorities say a pickup rear-ended an Amish horse-drawn carriage in southern Michigan, killing two children and seriously injuring two others and a woman who were in the carriage.
State police say the two adults and five children who were in the carriage were ejected when the truck hit it Friday night in Algansee Township, a farming community not far from Michigan's borders with Indiana and Ohio.
The children who were killed were 6 and 2 years old. Authorities say two other children, ages 3 and 4, were hospitalized with life-threatening injuries and that a woman also suffered serious injuries.
Sgt. Todd Price told ABC News that the pickup's driver was intoxicated at the time of the crash and is being held in Branch County Jail.
Rebel soccer icon: A Syrian soccer goalkeeper who became an icon of the rebellion against President Bashar Assad has died of wounds suffered in a battle with government forces, the rebels said Saturday.
Abdelbaset Sarout, 27, rose to fame as a player for his home city of Homs and won international titles representing his country. When peaceful protests broke out against Assad in 2011, Sarout led rallies and became known as the "singer of the revolution" for his songs and ballads.
Following the arc of the Syrian uprising, Sarout later took up arms as the country slid into civil war. Many activists and rebels came to refer to him as the "guardian of freedom," a play on the Arabic word for goalkeeper.

Texto completo: For some of you, this may sound like a horrible diet: What will I do for a month without Marc Thiessen, or Leonard Pitts? What will we talk about, if not Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi?
Well, let me gently suggest there's lots more to discuss: How about homelessness in the Coachella Valley? The state of our schools? Our unfunded pension liabilities?
The Desert Sun Opinion pages are going on summer vacation from national politics. For the month of July, we're taking a break from all the machinations of Washington and putting the focus back here at home.
That means no columns, no cartoons and no letters about the president, Congress, the Supreme Court, etc. Have a burning opinion about any of those things? Save it up, we'll get back to that in August.
Why this recess? Let me explain.
Earlier this year, a trio of university researchers from Louisiana State, Texas A&M and Colorado State published a fascinating – and troubling – study that found that the ongoing extinction of local newspapers across the nation contributes to political polarization.
How, you ask? Well, first some background facts: About 1,800 newspapers have shut down since 2004, many of them community weeklies. And many bigger papers that have stayed open have become shadows of their former selves. From 2008 to 2017, total newsroom staffing fell from 71,000 employees to 39,000, according to stats from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Fewer newspapers and fewer reporters means that there is less opportunity to find out about local politicians, issues and controversies. But most citizens don't stop consuming news; they simply turn to national sources, be it newspapers like the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal, or TV outlets like Fox or CNN.
We all know that national news coverage these days has an intense focus on the partisan war in Washington. According to the research study, published in the Journal of Communication, folks who have lost their local newspaper or have given up on it turn to national news outlets. Then, they apply their (increasingly hardened) feelings about national politics to their local city council or state legislature.
The result? More partisanship close to home.
Researchers found this by looking at "split ticket" voting. That's when a voter casts ballots for people of different parties in the same election. For example, a voter could choose a Democrat for the California Assembly, but back a Republican for the state Senate.
In 1992, 37% of states with Senate races elected a senator from a different party than the presidential candidate the state supported. In 2016, for the first time in 100 years, no state did that, the researchers found. As the daughter of a split household (Republican dad, Democrat mom), I found this troubling.
Johanna Dunaway, the communications professor at Texas A&M who was on the research team, explained to the Associated Press: "The voting behavior was more polarized, less likely to include split-ticket voting, if a newspaper had died in the community. We have this loss of engagement at the local level."
Dunaway and her colleagues reached that conclusion by comparing voting data from 66 communities where newspapers have shut down in the past 20 years to 77 communities where local newspapers continue to operate, she said.
The scholars found that voters were 1.9% more likely to vote for the same party for president and senator after a newspaper closed in their community, compared to voters in statistically similar areas where a paper remained open.
Now, 1.9% may not seem like a lot, but that can often be enough to win an election. Consider California's 21st Congressional district, which stretches from Fresno to Bakersfield. Last year, Democrat TJ Cox edged Republican opponent David Valadao by 0.8%. The district had elected Valadao in 2012, 2014 and 2016, even while voting for Barack Obama in 2012, and Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Thankfully, The Desert Sun hasn't been among those newspapers to go the way of the dinosaurs. Though we've lost staff over the years, we're still alive and kicking. But this study got me thinking about the role we play in the community, and the mix of stories on our opinion pages.
I wondered: In an era where there seems to be countless forums for people to scream about national politics, are we devoting the right amount of space to local and state issues?
I chatted about this with Al Franco, our Opinion pages editor and a 26-year Desert Sun veteran. An idea arose: What if we took a monthlong summer holiday in July from national politics on The Desert Sun's Opinion pages?
For some of you, this may sound like a horrible diet: What will I do for a month without Marc Thiessen, or Leonard Pitts? What will we talk about, if not Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi?
Well, let me gently suggest there's lots more to discuss: How about homelessness in the Coachella Valley? The state of our schools? Our unfunded pension liabilities?
Of course, it doesn't have to be all about problems. The op-ed pages are also a forum for highlighting the good in our midst.
To make this monthlong vacation a reality, we need your help. This is an open call for YOU to submit pieces to us for publication.
What are we looking for? Well, three things: Valley Voice columns, letters to the editor, and cartoons.
Guidelines for Valley Voice columns: Your column should address a political or social issue at the local or state level. It should be 500 to 550 words. We print the author's photo and contact info (typically an email address) with the column. We don't publish anonymous columns. Stick to a single topic and avoid personal attacks. The fine print: We reserve the right to edit and republish (including online) all columns. Please note, we do not accept columns submitted for publication elsewhere.
For letters: We welcome letters that are 200 or fewer words. These must be in your own words, free from libel, and in good taste. Letters must include the writer's full name, address, city and ZIP code, and a daytime phone number for verification. Only your name and city will be printed.
We do not accept medical praise, consumer complaints, religious tracts, letters from writers outside our circulation area, letters with unverified facts or vulgarity, and letters that have been submitted for publication elsewhere. For a while now, we have not accepted poetry, though we are lifting – for July at least – that restriction and will consider poems of 200 words or less.
Though during July we will not accept letters about national politics, we will consider letters reacting to our decision to go "on vacation" in July. Love the idea? Hate it? Let us know.
Letters will be edited for clarity, grammar and length. No more than one letter to the editor or Valley Voice column (one or the other) from a contributor will be published in a 30-day period.
We also will consider cartoons or other illustrations focused on local or state topics.
Sorry, but we do not pay for any submissions – though you will have our gratitude.
In addition to locally submitted items, we'll continue to publish California-focused columns from folks like Dan Walters of CAL Matters and Joe Mathews of Zocalo. We may also dig out some interesting material from our opinions archive.
Direct submissions and questions to letters@desertsun.com, or Engagement Editor/Opinion Al Franco at al.franco@desertsun.com. Please share this with anyone you think might have something interesting to say about the Coachella Valley, or California.
For 31 days, let's talk about home.

Trump gets Mexico deal — and once again backs away from tariffs

Texto completo: Bloomberg News
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump pushed Mexico — and his own party — to the brink when he threatened massive new tariffs over illegal immigration. And he now has a cross-border deal to show for it.
He also added another chapter in his now-familiar pattern on tariffs: threaten to go big, pull back at the last minute.
Trump announced late Friday that he wouldn’t impose a sliding scale of tariffs on goods from Mexico — from 5% to 25% over time — after that nation agreed to take a tougher stance on immigration, which was his goal all along.
Mexico did commit to doing more — deploy National Guard troops to help curb illegal migration and agree to care for Central Americans seeking asylum in the U.S. indefinitely as their cases wind through the system.
American negotiators had been asking Mexico for the past year since the election of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in July 2018 to do more to stop the flow of migrants. But it was only in the past week, under the threat of tariffs, that they felt Mexico had begun negotiating seriously, according to a U.S. official.
“Mexico successfully avoided the catastrophe of tariffs but will pay a heavy price,” said Duncan Wood, director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “Potentially tens of thousands of refugee claimants will have to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed. Mexico will have to house, employ, educate and provide health care for them. This is a huge commitment” for the government.
Mexico has been gearing up to address the surge of migrants, with Mexico’s foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, saying Thursday the country was prepared to deploy about 6,000 guard troops. And the country already has been hosting asylum seekers while their cases were being processed.
The U.S. originally demanded that Central American migrants apply for asylum in Mexico instead of the U.S. But Mexico beat back that demand. Also, there was no formal language in the deal that Mexico would increase purchases of U.S. agricultural products, as Trump had promised on Twitter.
All of this could leave some of those most upset over Trump’s approach, including some Republicans, questioning whether the turmoil of the last week was really worth it.
The whole episode also had a familiar feel: Trump has repeatedly threatened Mexico over immigration only to back off. First, he said he’d immediately close the southern border over migration. Then he pivoted in April to a new demand: that the Mexican government stop the flow of illegal drugs into the U.S. within a year or face tariffs on automobiles.
Separately, Trump has threatened European and Japanese carmakers with tariffs in the name of national security but then said he’d delay any action by 180 days.
This is far from the first time the president has faced criticism over his stance on tariffs. What made this time different was just how alone Trump was in his position. The list of opponents to the idea was long: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, farm groups, automakers and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who took the rare step of saying publicly he disagreed with the president.
Even elsewhere in the Trump administration there was little vocal support for Trump’s Mexico tariffs. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin opposed them, a person familiar with the matter said. So did Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, the New York Times reported.
Republicans, who have grown adept at talking about areas of disagreement with Trump without sounding like they disagree, didn’t hold back.
“I don’t even want to think about it,” Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said last week after he was asked about the potential economic harm to his home state.
“I know he’s sometimes, in his frustration, expressed his intention to do certain things, but after calm reflection and consultation with the members of the Congress has decided maybe to pursue a different course,” Cornyn said then. “So that’s what I hope will happen here.”
The wishes of Cornyn — and many others — were granted.
Republicans quickly rallied around the president for securing the deal and suggested this could clear the way for Congress to approve the new trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, known as the USMCA.
“Trump has proven those who doubted him wrong by getting Mexico to step up their efforts to help us secure our southern border,” the No. 2 House Republican, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said in a statement. “Tonight’s deal made by President Trump also puts us in a better position to make USMCA a reality.”
Yet other Republicans were more nuanced in their reaction. Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said her constituents were “breathing a sigh of relief” and that Mexico “stepped up to help” address the humanitarian crisis. But her statement Friday night didn’t mention Trump.
The deal does alleviate a political challenge for McConnell, given that the 2020 electoral map is far less friendly for the GOP than for Democrats.
Trump’s approval ratings are underwater in a handful of states where Senate Republicans are running for re-election, including Ernst, Cory Gardner in Colorado, Susan Collins in Maine and Thom Tillis in North Carolina.
While Tillis, who faces a primary challenge, was an early backer of Trump’s tariff strategy despite previously calling himself a free trader, others including Cornyn, Ernst and Gardner have been outspoken critics of the president’s trade policy.
Trump had announced the tariff threat in response to a surge in illegal migration to the U.S. through Mexico this year. More than 144,000 people were apprehended after illegally crossing the southern border in May or were refused entry to the U.S. That’s the most in a single month in at least five years; the number has grown every month since January.
Ebrard, said the resolution was fair. “We reached some middle point,” he said.
He added that the two countries will continue discussion for other possible steps in 90 days if needed, an implicit reminder that tensions could flare again if the migrant crisis continues to worsen.

AFGHANS CONTINUE TO PAY THE PRICE FOR NEARLY 20 YEARS OF CONFLICT

Texto completo: Eastern Kunar, a sylvan province with jagged mountains on the border of Afghanistan and Pakistan, has been ravaged by conflict for many years. It was a stronghold for the Taliban a decade ago, and more recently for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan Province, or ISIL-KP, active in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Carmen Gentile, a journalist from Western Pennsylvania, is one victim. On Sept. 9, 2010, he was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by the Taliban while he was talking with three young Afghan villagers in the Nari District of Kunar. It shattered his face. Numerous surgeries have repaired most of the damage, but could not save his right eye. He returned six times to Afghanistan, writing about the conflict. "Blindsided by the Taliban" was his story of war, trauma, love and loss. "One of the reasons that I wrote the book, people asked me, tens of thousands of times, what happened to you?" he said.
But it is the Afghans, every day, who are paying a massive price in this crippling conflict that is nearly two decades old. It could be a suicide bombing, unexpectedly happening in a major city or town, carried out by the Taliban, the Islamic State of Khorasan or other militants. Or it could be airstrikes launched by the U.S. and NATO or the Afghan Air Force. Some days, the price is paid by those caught up in the crossfire.
Horrific and heartbreaking tales of civilian casualties make the headlines for big news outlets around the world, but are rarely followed by investigations or prosecutions of the perpetrators. For the ultimate victims, nobody asks, "What happened to you?"
A few months after Mr. Gentile's injury, in March 2011, nine boys ages 9 to 15 were mistakenly killed by US/NATO helicopters while they were collecting firewood on a hillside to heat their homes during the harsh winter in poverty-stricken Nanglam village in the Pech valley.
Among the dead was Khalid, 14, who lived with 13 sisters and two mothers who had been married to his deceased father. He was the sole breadwinner, typical in the male-dominated society of Afghanistan, where the man is often the backbone of the family, responsible for the financial and physical well-being of all the members.
Tamamay, 70, his mother, suffers from chronic insomnia, not able to sleep even a half hour in 24, said Mawlavi Jabir, one of Tamamay's sons-in-law. "Khalid spent his entire childhood with her," Jabir recalled last month. "To Khalid her arms were like a cradle."
Tamamay's caretakers try to keep the grief-crazed mother tied by a rope to a bed to prevent her from going outside to the cemetery where Khalid was buried.
The New York Times reported that the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, apologized for the boys' deaths and said: "These deaths should have never happened." Former Afghan president Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the incident and called it "ruthless."
But such words are little comfort to the survivors.
In Afghanistan, myriad mothers are heartbroken. Decades of armed conflict and economic misery can have a devastating effect on mental health, particularly for women.
The World Health Organization in 2017 said that nearly a million Afghans suffer from depressive and disorders while over 1.2 million suffer from anxiety disorders.
Mawlavi Jabir said that Tamamay has almost completely lost her memory. The only few words she still remembers and is rarely heard murmuring: "Khalid is alive, nothing happened to him, Khalid is coming."
In the recent history of conflict in Afghanistan, the U.S. covertly supplied shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles to the Afghan Mujahideen, the guerrilla forces who fought and defeated the Soviet Union, which abandoned Afghanistan in 1989.
The grandchildren of those U.S.-backed Mujahideen now struggle to banish American troops from their homeland. "For the Taliban, it's doesn't matter, they are not counting years and decades like the U.S.," Mr. Gentile said. They are in for the long haul.
The turmoil continues to cost thousands of lives, and cause devastation, mass migration, trauma and depression.
A recent United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan report documented, in the first quarter of 2019, 1,773 civilian casualties (581 deaths and 1,192 injured) including 582 child casualties.

Texto completo: If you were paying close attention last week, you might have spotted a pattern in the news. Peeking out from behind the breathless coverage of the Trump family's tuxedoed trip to London was a spate of deaths of immigrants in U.S. custody: Johana Medina Leon, a 25-year-old transgender asylum seeker; an unnamed 33-year-old Salvadoran man; and a 40-year-old woman from Honduras.
Photos from a Border Patrol processing center in El Paso showed people herded so tightly into cells that they had to stand on toilets to breathe. Memos surfaced by journalist Ken Klippenstein revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement's failure to provide medical care was responsible for suicides and other deaths of detainees. These followed another report that showed thousands of detainees were being brutally held in isolation cells just for being transgender or mentally ill.
Also last week, the Trump administration cut funding for classes, recreation and legal aid at detention centers holding minors -- which were likened to "summer camps" by a senior ICE official last year. And there was the revelation that months after being torn from their parents' arms, 37 children were locked in vans for up to 39 hours in the parking lot of a detention center near Port Isabel, Texas. In the last year, at least seven migrant kids have died in federal custody.

Preventing mass outrage at a system like this takes work. Certainly it helps that the media covers these horrors intermittently rather than as snowballing proof of a racist, lawless administration. But most of all, authorities prevail when the places where people are being tortured and left to die stay hidden, misleadingly named and far from prying eyes.
There's a name for that kind of system. They're called concentration camps. You might balk at my use of the term. That's good -- it's something to be balked at.
The goal of concentration camps has always been to be ignored. The German-Jewish political theorist Hannah Arendt, who was imprisoned by the Gestapo and interned in a French camp, wrote a few years afterward about the different levels of concentration camps. Extermination camps were the most extreme; others were just about getting "undesirable elements ... out of the way." All had one thing in common: "The human masses sealed off in them are treated as if they no longer existed, as if what happened to them were no longer of interest to anybody, as if they were already dead."
Euphemisms play a big role in that forgetting. The term "concentration camp" is itself a euphemism. It was invented by a Spanish official to paper over his relocation of millions of rural families into squalid garrison towns where they would starve during Cuba's 1895 independence war. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered Japanese Americans into prisons during World War II, he initially called them concentration camps. Americans ended up using more benign names, like "Manzanar Relocation Center."
Even the Nazis' camps started out small, housing criminals, Communists and opponents of the regime. It took five years to begin the mass detention of Jews. It took eight, and the outbreak of a world war, for the first extermination camps to open. Even then, the Nazis had to keep lying to distract attention, claiming Jews were merely being resettled to remote work sites. That's what the famous signs -- Arbeit Macht Frei, or "Work Sets You Free" -- were about.
Subterfuge doesn't always work. A year ago, Americans accidentally became aware that the Trump administration had adopted (and lied about) a policy of ripping families apart at the border. The flurry of attention was thanks to the viral conflation of two separate but related news stories: the family separation order and bureaucrats' admission that they'd been unable to locate thousands of migrant children who'd been placed with sponsors after crossing the border alone.
Trump shoved that easily down the memory hole. He dragged his heels a bit, then agreed to a new policy: throwing whole families into camps together. Political reporters posed irrelevant questions, like whether President Obama had been just as bad, and what it meant for the midterms. Then they moved on.
It is important to note that Trump's aides have built this system of racist terror on something that has existed for a long time. Several camps opened under Obama, and as president he deported millions of people.
But Trump's game is different. It certainly isn't about negotiating immigration reform with Congress. Trump has made it clear that he wants to stifle all non-white immigration, period. His mass arrests, iceboxes and dog cages are part of an explicitly nationalist project to put the country under the control of the right kind of white people.
As a Republican National Committee report noted in 2013: "The nation's demographic changes add to the urgency of recognizing how precarious our position has become." The Trump administration's move to put a citizenship question on the 2020 census was also just revealed to have been a plot to disadvantage political opponents and boost "Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites" all along.
That's why this isn't just a crisis facing immigrants. When a leader puts people in camps to stay in power, history shows that he doesn't usually stop with the first group he detains.
There are now at least 48,000 people detained in ICE facilities, which a former official told BuzzFeed News "could swell indefinitely." Customs and Border Protection officials apprehended more than 144,000 people on the southwest border last month. (The New York Times dutifully reported this as evidence of a "dramatic surge in border crossings," rather than what it was: The administration using its own surge of arrests to justify the rest of its policies.)
If we call them what they are -- a growing system of American concentration camps -- we will be more likely to give them the attention they deserve. We need to know their names: Port Isabel, Dilley, Adelanto, Hutto and on and on. With constant, unrelenting attention, it is possible we might alleviate the plight of the people inside, and stop the crisis from getting worse. Maybe people won't be able to disappear so easily into the iceboxes. Maybe it will be harder for authorities to lie about children's deaths.
Maybe Trump's concentration camps will be the first thing we think of when we see him scowling on TV.
The only other option is to leave it up to those in power to decide what's next. That's a calculated risk. As Andrea Pitzer, author of "One Long Night," one of the most comprehensive books on the history of concentration camps, recently noted: "Every country has said their camps are humane and will be different. Trump is instinctively an authoritarian. He'll take them as far as he's allowed to."

Texto completo: [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox .]
The conversation had just turned to night life in the city when Louis Boria, an administrative assistant at Mount Sinai Hospital, groaned. He sat in the back of the yarn shop, String Thing Studio, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, knitting the beginnings of a yoke sweater.
"There's no more clubs," said Mr. Boria, who is the organizer of a weekly guys' knitting night, which welcomes men and teenagers no matter how they identify (as well as crocheters).
"So now we're left with the bar scene and all those people are packed into the bar." Mr. Boria tried to remember the name of a gay bar in Hell's Kitchen and asked the seven men sitting at the table with him if they knew.
[The New York Times wants to capture the ever-evolving ways in which we describe ourselves. Tell us who you are.]
The other knitters, drinking rosé from disposable cups, stared blankly at Mr. Boria. He offered a few more details. "The guys get up on the bars," he said. Then someone figured it out: "Flaming Saddles!"
"Yes!" said Mr. Boria.
"Clearly we're not the clubby types," said Jaime Andrade, who was diligently stitching a teal short-sleeved sweater fringed by lace, a birthday present for his sister.
The conversation shifted to industry gossip. Drew Ariana, a designer, divulged a yarn shop's financial trouble. Felicia Eve, the owner of String Thing and an honorary female member that night, said a woman dissed someone's swatch on Instagram. Ms. Eve wore a T-shirt that said, "I Knit Before It Was Cool."
Soon, Jonathan Requillo, a store designer for Clinique, arrived with another bottle of rosé. And finally, toward the end of the night, Joe Major, a photographer, slipped in.
Mr. Major was having a rough week and wanted to be around people. Going out for drinks is too expensive and he's sick of everyone glued to their phones, he said, so he decided to come to the guys' knit night instead.
As Mr. Major stitched a black beanie, Cairo Romaguera, who works in H.I.V. prevention, took out his cellphone and began taking pictures of Mr. Boria through a filter. The men laughed loudly at the resulting image, which transformed Mr. Boria into a woman. With all the excitement, Mr. Major dropped a stitch. His mistake didn't matter though. "The social interaction is priceless," he said.
Fed up with awkward small talk and impersonal interactions at bars, some gay men in New York are looking for alternative ways to connect. You couldn't call it a knitting explosion, exactly, but in small pockets -- at yarn shops, apartments and gay bars throughout the city -- a new kind of knitting circle is emerging.
"I don't feel like being in a bar or a club is conducive to getting to know people," said Michael Richman, who has a business knitting jockstraps and harnesses and began a monthly nude knit night in an apartment in Harlem last year. Mr. Richman described the bar scene as "sensory deprivation," meaning no one truly sees or hears one another.
Still, some groups do meet at bars in the city, like the bimonthly knit circle at the Holler, a queer bar in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. But the intention is to bond over a shared interest, not alcohol. After all, it can be challenging to stop for a sip when you're casting on stitches with both hands.
This makes knitting circles especially appealing for those who don't drink.
"The more anxious and uncomfortable you feel, the more you drink," said Alan Montes, who attends Mr. Richman's nude knit night and is in recovery. "At the knitting night, there's no evidence or example of that excess." Several men at Mr. Richman's event said knitting in the nude fostered intimate conversation. The men have discussed their coming out stories and their childhood experiences being gay, topics that don't tend to arise in bars. Mr. Richman said several men have even started dating.
"We've reached a tipping point," said Erik Heitz, one attendee, about the bar scene. "You get dolled up and spend a ton of money and New York City is costly, and you're like, 'Gosh, I spent $ 100, and did I get what I wanted out of this? Could I spend $ 10 at Michaels and bring a bottle of wine to this house party and get a more genuine experience?' Maybe so."
In a more clothed and public setting downtown, about 10 men and women waited for the doors to open at Club Cumming in the East Village. By the time Knit@Nite, the bar's weekly knitting social, started at 6, all of the seats had been taken. Brini Maxwell, one of the event's hosts, showed off her handmade 1970s-inspired suit and yellow blouse.
Alan Cumming, the bar's co-owner and a knitter himself, came up with the idea for Knit@Nite. Sam Benedict, the manager at Club Cumming, organized it. He tapped Josh Bennett, a knitwear designer whom he described as "the hunk of the knit world" and Ms. Maxwell, who is known as "the Martha Stewart of drag," to be the hosts.
The evening consists of raffle prizes, a potluck dessert, and special guests, who tend to be celebrities of the fiber world like editors at "Vogue Knitting" and London Kaye, the Yarn Bomber, whose knitted street art has appeared on fences and water pipes all over the city.
On June 25, during Pride Week, the special guest will be Frank DeCaro, the actor and TV personality, to talk about his new book, "Drag: Combing Through the Big Wigs of Show Business." Additionally, the knitted hearts that attendees made for Valentine's Day and donated to the Peyton Heart Project, a nonprofit that raises awareness about suicide and bullying, will be given out during the NYC Pride March, on June 30.
Several of the men from Mr. Boria's knit night at String Thing were also at Club Cumming. Richard Shen, who said he has been turned away from women's knitting circles, wore a headlamp while he knit. Mr. Major took a selfie with Ms. Maxwell. And Mr. Romaguera arrived with a plastic bag full of projects.
Standing back near the D.J., Mr. Romaguera pulled out a pair of short shorts. They had a purple band, a knit drawstring, and a brightly colored body in orange, blue, green, and hot pink. "I told myself I wouldn't knit this here," he said, looping his needles through the yarn. He had a crochet piece he needed to finish.
Later, Mr. Romaguera walked over to a group of women sitting at a table to show them the shorts. "There's a pouch for the butt," he said. The women cooed. "Are you going to wear them without underwear?" asked Kalliopi Aronis, who had come that night just to hang out.
Mr. Romaguera noted that they were acrylic, and that he would be wearing underwear. He figured he would use the shorts for the gym.
But Ms. Aronis had another idea. "You should come pole dancing with me," she said. "And wear those. "

The racial reckoning comes

Texto completo: When I was a boy I was taught a certain story about America. This was the land of opportunity. Immigrants came to this land and found an open field and a fair chance to pursue their dreams. In this story Benjamin Franklin could be held up as the quintessential American - the young hustler, who through his ingenuity and dogged self-improvement created new businesses and communities, a new sort of person and a new sort of country.
This was a unifying national story. When it dominated, politics was over which party could offer the most opportunity.
But that story has been challenged over the years, most compellingly by the people we used to call multiculturalists. The Ben Franklin story, they point out, doesn't include the Native American or African-American experience; it doesn't take into account the ways America has not really offered a fair chance to many of its people.
The multicultural story gradually began to rival the Ben Franklin story, especially in schools. Over the past two years it has almost entirely eclipsed it in many parts of our society.
I realized this while reading my friend and colleague Eric Liu's new book, "Become America." Eric's organization Citizen University hosts regular gatherings called "Civic Saturdays." These look like church or synagogue services, but the object of veneration is America. How can we tell our story? How can we be good citizens? What rituals embody our civic creed?
Eric gives sermons in the middle of these sessions, and the book is a collection of sermons delivered between November 2016 and August 2018 - nearly the first two years of the Trump era. The collection is like a penetrating time-lapse movie of the American mind over that period.
Eric is an enlightened Seattle progressive but with a reconciling, loving temperament. His hero is Abraham Lincoln and his goal is to heal a divided nation. In the early sermons, just after Donald Trump's victory, Eric is torn - he wants to empathize with Trump voters but also to judge them harshly. But, overall, the emphasis is on humbly understanding global populism.
Then come Charlottesville, the outrages at the southern border. As the months go by, Eric's attention turns more to race. Trump is no longer seen as a historic aberration, but the embodiment of white supremacy that has always been near the core of the American experience. He is the modern-day John Calhoun, just as mass incarceration is the modern-day Jim Crow.
Eric is not alone in his shift in emphasis. As Zach Goldberg points out in Tablet, over the past several years there has been a sharp shift in opinion, especially among white progressives, on all subjects racial. For most of the latter half of the 20th century, for example, about 10% of white liberals supported increased immigration; now it's 50%. As Goldberg writes, African-Americans are actually less progressive on these issues than white liberals.
Both Trumpists and their opponents have also de-emphasized the Ben Franklin narrative and embraced narratives that put race at the center. Trump's narrative is: We real Americans (white) have to protect our culture from the alien (brown) who would weaken it.
The opposing narrative is something like this: America began with a crime - stealing the land from Native Americans. It continued with an atrocity, slavery. The American story is the conflict between oppressors who seek to preserve white supremacy and people who seek to move beyond it. The essential American struggle is to confront the national sin, have a racial reckoning and then seek reconciliation.
"A religion provides a moral framework for choice and an ethical standard for action," Eric writes. Both these narratives have taken on the qualities of a civic religion.
As many writers have noted, in the progressive account, racism has the exact same structure as John Calvin's conception of original sin. It is a corrupting group inheritance, a shared guilt that pervades everything - it is in the structures of our society and the invisible crannies of our minds.
I don't know about you, but I walk into this next chapter of American life with a sense of hopefulness and yet great fear. America needs to have a moment of racial reconciliation. History has thrown this task upon us.
But we Americans are not at our best when we launch off on holy wars. Once you start assigning guilt to groups, rather than to individuals, bad, illiberal things are likely to happen. There's a lot of over-generalized group accusation in both these narratives.
I'm haunted by that sentence in Lincoln's second inaugural: "And the war came." Nobody wanted it, but it came. Eric's great contribution is to show how to mix conviction on racial matters with humility and gentleness. Moreover, he is always pushing toward an American creed that moves beyond both the white monoculture and the fracturing multiculturalism. He is always pushing toward a national story large enough to contain all the hybrid voices.
Somewhere in America a young artist is writing that story, that new vision that will serve as a beacon to draw us all onward.

Texto completo: Mexican imports account for 3.2% of Kentucky's economy, according to an analysis by the New York Times, which noted that Michigan is highest at 10.5%, followed by Texas (5.9%), Rhode Island (4.1%) and Kentucky.
Kentucky's manufacturing-heavy economy would be hit harder than most states if President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs on Mexico take effect.
According to two recent analyses of how the proposed tariffs would impact individual states, Kentucky's imports from Mexico rank fourth highest nationwide as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Mexico is Kentucky's second largest trading partner, with $6.77 billion in goods sent to businesses and residents of the state last year.
In a blog post this week, the conservative-leaning Pegasus Institute called the proposed cut to Kentucky's economy "devastating."
If the trade levies are increased from 5% to 25% by October as Trump has said they could be, "this would unquestionably mean layoffs, decreased production in signature industries, and increased costs for consumers across the board," Jordan Harris wrote in the Pegasus Blog posted Thursday.
Trump has escalated pressure on the Mexican government to step up efforts to halt waves of mostly Central American migrants crossing through Mexico from entering the U.S. illegally at the Southern border.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans in Congress have joined the call for Trump to reverse course on the tariffs, the first of which would take effect on Monday.
Greater Louisville Inc., the metro area's chamber of commerce, chimed in, urging congressional leaders to thwart the latest Trump proposal and to focus on creating a stable trade policy to allow businesses to plan for jobs and investment.
"We need certainty in the market," said Iris Wilbur, director of government affairs and public policy.
Kentucky's automotive sector could take a big hit, but the region's position as a warehousing, distribution and logistics hub is also a concern because if the amount of goods flowing through Louisville is reduced, Wilbur said, the industry will suffer.
The same goes for food imports from Mexico, which GLI projects could have big implications for Louisville's retailers and the broader hospitality sector.
If the tariffs take effect, "there'll be pain in the short term and long term," Wilbur said.
She added that GLI, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other business and manufacturing trade groups remain focused on passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the NAFTA replacement treaty, which imposes no duty fees or tariffs on goods flowing between the three countries.
Mexican imports account for 3.2% of Kentucky's economy, according to an analysis by the New York Times, which noted that Michigan is highest at 10.5%, followed by Texas (5.9%), Rhode Island (4.1%) and Kentucky.
The Pegasus Institute estimated that based on recent imports, the 5% tariffs would mean $338.5 million a year in increased expenses, and up to $1.7 billion in added expenses if the tariffs eventually were boosted to 25%.
Kentucky is home to three large automotive plants: two Ford Motor Co. facilities in Louisville, as well as a Toyota manufacturing complex in Georgetown, which rely on parts and components from Mexico. Parts suppliers and other businesses that serve the factories bring the state's total automotive-related workforce to 95,000 people.
Toyota spokesman Rick Hesterberg forwarded a statement from the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers' Chief Executive David Schwietert that summarizes the automaker's views:
"Our position on tariffs remains unchanged: They are a tax on our customers, which means they're harmful to our nation's economy and the millions of American jobs that depend on cross-border trade.
"The auto sector – and the 10 million American jobs it supports – relies upon the North American supply chain and cross border commerce to remain globally competitive. This is especially true with auto parts which can cross the U.S. border multiple times before final assembly."
Schwietert added that "any barrier to the flow of commerce across the U.S.-Mexico border will have a cascading effect – harming U.S. consumers, threatening American jobs and investment, curtailing the economic progress that the administration is working to reignite, and potentially stalling efforts to ratify the agreement in Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. Congress."

Texto completo: A Navy SEAL accused of war crimes won't face life in prison without parole if convicted.
The Navy judge overseeing the case ruled out the possibility against Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher after a series of unusual events catapulted the case into the public spotlight.
Capt. Aaron Rugh denied the defense team's motion to dismiss the case on Friday, but did acknowledge that Navy officials have exerted undue command influence in the proceedings. In response, Rugh ruled the highest sentence a jury can give Gallagher is life with the possibility of parole and has awarded the defense two extra exemptions it can use to remove jurors during jury selection.
"The Navy remains committed to an impartial military justice system that provides due process and fundamental fairness," Navy spokesman Brian O'Rourke told the Washington Examiner. "Chief Petty Officer Gallagher is presumed to be innocent, and the Navy will safeguard his right to a fair trial."
Gallagher, 39, is accused of murdering an injured teenage ISIS fighter while on deployment to Iraq in 2017, in addition to a number of other crimes. Prosecutors allege he stabbed the fighter to death with his knife. Some of Gallagher's former platoon mates reportedly accused him of engaging in reckless behavior and war crimes. His defenders say he is a war hero who has fallen victim to an unruly and overzealous prosecution team.
Gallagher was arrested on Sept. 11, 2018, but his case didn't draw national headlines until the New York Times issued a damning report in April accusing him of crimes, including randomly firing machine guns and rockets into neighborhoods and shooting an unarmed man and school-age girl. The case against Gallagher seemed strong until the prosecution team reportedly embedded email tracking software in its correspondence with the defense, raising questions about a potential ethics violation.
Gallagher's lawyer, Timothy Parlatore, filed motions in response seeking dismissal of the charges, the lead prosecutor, and Rugh, though the latter was eventually withdrawn. Two other motions sought to compel the prosecution to be interviewed by the defense and alleged undue command influence from Navy officials.
Rugh's ruling found that the use of the email tracking software "placed an intolerable strain on the public's perception of the military justice system," requiring a solution for the defense, despite his denial of the motion itself.
Rugh previously released Gallagher from pre-trial custody last week and later dismissed lead prosecutor Cmdr. Chris Czaplak on Monday, swinging momentum in Gallagher's favor. The trial has been rescheduled for June 17 from its original June 10 date.

Texto completo: " Pavarotti " is a documentary by Ron Howard ("Solo: A Star Wars Story") about Luciano Pavarotti. Made with the full support and participation of the late opera singer's family this film portrait is "warm but distant (and hagiographic)," according to IndieWire. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains brief strong language and a war-related image. 114 minutes.

" Halston ," a documentary about the life and career of the late fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick - who famously invented hot pants - "doesn't know when to leave well enough alone," according to the New York Times.

Texto completo: It's an open question whether House Democrats will initiate impeachment proceedings against President Trump for obstructing an investigation into claims that Russians interfered to help get him elected in 2016.
Calls have grown louder since the April release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report. While it didn't conclude that Trump or his campaign coordinated with Russia, it also failed to exonerate him, and in fact outlined several possible instances of obstruction.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has resisted calls to begin impeachment proceedings, an act that would bring even more chaos to Washington less than 18 months before the next presidential election.
But what would impeachment articles against Trump look like?
A New York Times editorial assistant who to grew up in Maine attempted to answer that question.
In an interactive piece published on the Times' website Wednesday, Ian Prasad Philbrick, a 2012 graduate of Greely High School in Cumberland, created draft articles of impeachment against Trump using as templates articles that were brought against Richard Nixon in 1974 and against Bill Clinton in 1998.
NIXON RESIGNED BEFOREHAND
Nixon resigned before the House could vote on impeachment, largely because it became clear he would not be cleared of charges that he interfered with an investigation of the Watergate break-in. Clinton was impeached by the Republican-led House, but was acquitted of charges by the Senate for lying about his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Philbrick, 25, who has worked as a researcher for the Times opinion page since graduating from Georgetown University in 2017, outlined the ways in which Trump's alleged conduct mirrors Nixon's. Both declined to be questioned by FBI. Both provided false information to potential witnesses.
"An impeachment inquiry against Mr. Trump is far from guaranteed And whether impeaching him would politically help or hurt Democrats remains an open question," he wrote. "But there is no question that by the standards for high crimes and misdemeanors applied to past presidents in living memory, Donald J. Trump has committed impeachable offenses."
60 IN HOUSE WANT TO IMPEACH
So far, 60 House members have publicly supported impeachment, including Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine.
In an interview, Philbrick said the piece was conceived shortly after the Mueller Report was released. He said it's his first in the Times that he authored alone.
"We wanted to visualize what we know of the president's conduct and contrast that with past efforts," he said.
The piece drew attention on social media Wednesday - NBC News legal analyst Mimi Rocah and historian Kevin Kruse were both discussing it - and Philbrick called it a privilege to participate in the debate over impeachment.
"I'm especially proud in the visual aspects of the piece," he said. "It felt like a different way to tell this story."

Junta Leader in Thailand Is Named Prime Minister After a Contentious Vote

Texto completo: BANGKOK -- The leader of the junta that seized power in Thailand five years ago, Prayuth Chan-ocha, was chosen by Parliament to be prime minister after an election marred by charges of manipulation.
Mr. Prayuth, a former general who held the title of prime minister during the years of military rule, won by a combined vote of 500 to 244 in the House of Representatives and Senate.
He defeated the opposition nominee, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, the leader of the pro-democracy Future Forward Party who was elected to Parliament but suspended from his seat last month by the Constitutional Court.
Mr. Prayuth, who is not a member of Parliament, chose not to address the joint session. Mr. Thanathorn was not allowed to speak before Parliament but delivered a speech outside the chamber.
"I am ready to be the prime minister of truth," he said. "I am ready to be the prime minister of change. And I am ready to be the prime minister to take Thailand to move forward."
Future Forward leaders alleged that some lawmakers were offered the equivalent of $ 1 million or more to switch sides, though they did not say who made the offers. One member said he had been offered increasingly larger amounts until the figure reached nearly $ 4 million. A spokesman for the military-backed party, Palang Pracharat, did not respond to a request for comment.
Given that the military appointed all 250 members of the Senate, Parliament's upper house, Mr. Prayuth's thin edge in the 500-member lower house suggests he is likely to face substantial opposition there from pro-democracy forces in the coming months.
For Mr. Prayuth, an autocratic ruler who wielded absolute authority as head of the military's National Council for Peace and Order, leading a multiparty, coalition government will be an adjustment.
To get the votes to become prime minister, he had to agree to appoint cabinet ministers from allied parties. And for the first time, he may now be held to account by an elected lower house with a sizable opposition bloc.
"This will be different than over the past five years," said Purawich Watanasukh, a research fellow at the independent King Prajadhipok's Institute in Bangkok. "In the military regime, he had sole power. This time, we had an election and he has to share power."
Thailand, a constitutional monarchy, has a long history of military coups and rewritten constitutions.
The junta seized power in 2014, led by Mr. Prayuth, then a general, after months of paralyzing street protests in Bangkok by the followers of two rival political factions that are aligned today with the Democrat Party and the Pheu Thai Party.
The junta adopted an interim Constitution, which gave the head of the regime absolute power over all branches of government.
For years, Thailand was the only country in the world ruled solely by a military regime until April, when Sudan's president was toppled in a military coup.
The Thai junta promised elections but it first drafted a new Constitution that gave the military substantial power over what would normally be seen as civilian affairs, including appointing senators, who serve five-year terms.
The military won voters' approval of the Constitution in 2017 in a one-sided referendum in which opponents were prevented from campaigning.
The junta leaders hoped that the long-delayed lower house elections on March 24 would give them the veneer of legitimacy at home and abroad, while ultimately letting them retain power.
"The international pressure was high," Mr. Thanathorn, the Future Forward Party leader, said in an interview. "They couldn't continue being a military government forever."
The result is a hybrid government that will be neither a military regime nor a democracy.
The new government's legitimacy has already been called into question by the opposition.
Mr. Thanathorn accused the military-appointed Election Commission of manipulating the election results. He claims the commission changed seat allocations to tip control of the lower house from the pro-democracy opposition to the military's backers.
Mr. Thanathorn, who emerged from the vote as a leader of Thailand's democracy movement, said he and his party have been slapped with a dozen election complaints and criminal charges in an effort to muzzle them.
The Constitutional Court suspended him from taking his seat in Parliament last week after the Election Commission filed a case accusing him of not divesting his shares in a media company before a deadline.
Mr. Thanathorn denies the allegation and is fighting to be reinstated.
"Nobody really believed this election would be free and fair," he said. "But it is way below what is acceptable, and that is why people are angry out there."
One aim of the military in drafting the new Constitution was to reduce the power of large parties, particularly Pheu Thai, the latest iteration of a populist party that elected Thaksin Shinawatra 2001 and his sister, Yingluck, in 2011.
Both prime ministers were ousted by military coups. Accused of corruption, they now live in self-imposed exile.
Competing under the new election rules, both Pheu Thai and its rival, the Democrat Party, suffered a large decline in the number of seats they won compared with the 2011 election, the last vote deemed valid.
Two new parties, the military-backed Palang Pracharat and the pro-democracy Future Forward made strong showings. But no single party came close to winning a majority under the Election Commission's complex and shifting formulas.
The remaining seats were divided among two dozen other parties, making it difficult for any faction to form a majority. Eleven small parties that were each allotted a single seat after a contested rule change announced that they would all back Mr. Prayuth for prime minister.
The Democrat Party announced that it would back Mr. Prayuth, prompting its former leader and a former prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, to resign from the seat in Parliament that he recently won. He had promised during the campaign that the party would not support the junta leader.
In seeking the legitimacy that an election could bring, the military must give up some of its power, at least on paper, said Mr. Purawich, the research fellow. When Mr. Prayuth takes office as the elected prime minister, the National Council on Peace and Order will cease to exist as the ruling body and his unilateral control of the government will end.
In the new era, Mr. Prayuth is likely to be the leader of a fragile coalition government, with numerous parties seeking to advance their interests amid the prospect of parliamentary gridlock.
One outcome could be the early dissolution of Parliament and new elections, Mr. Purawich said.
In an Opinion article published in The New York Times a day after the election, former Prime Minister Thaksin accused the junta of rigging the election and questioned whether Thai voters or other nations would see Mr. Prayuth's government as legitimate.
"People in office are supposed to come and go while the system remains," he wrote. "This military government is ready to destroy the system simply to keep its people in power."

Texto completo: This past weekend, Jeopardy! executive producer Harry Friedman was looking forward to Monday, when millions of viewers would eagerly tune in to see if phenom James Holzhauer would break champion Ken Jennings’ record winnings. Holzhauer only needed about $59,000, so it seemed like a distinct possibility.
Then, Sunday afternoon, Friedman and his fellow producers received disturbing news. Somehow, someone had “pirated” the feed of the episode and a clip leaked on the internet showed Holzhauer losing in dramatic fashion, as he fell just short of the $2.5 million that Jennings won over 74 games in 2004.
“Somebody alerted us that they had seen it on YouTube. By the time we saw it, it already had 2,000 views,” Friedman said in an interview. The footage quickly spread to other social media sites.
“I feel bad for the viewers. It’s not fair,” he said. “I’m not sure what’s gained by doing something like that, other than some malicious intent. It doesn’t really benefit anybody.”
As the clip circulated, headlines about possible Jeopardy! spoilers started popping up on various websites and blogs on Sunday — although producers wouldn’t verify if the footage was accurate. Late Monday morning, after the show’s first broadcast aired in Montgomery, Ala., outlets including and New York Times published stories, with carefully crafted headlines and “spoiler” warnings, confirming that the clip was from that day’s episode and that Holzhauer had lost.
While Friedman said he “can’t say at this point” who posted the footage, producers have a good idea of what happened. “We think we know where and who and how,” he said, adding that the show will take “very, very, very appropriate” action against those responsible.
Nonetheless, Friedman was happy to see the excited response Monday from fans who were captivated by Holzhauer’s astonishing run. As a professional sports gambler, his hardball tactics of vacuuming up the highest-value clues and wagering huge amounts on Daily Double and Final Jeopardy became must-see TV.
“I think it reinforces that excellence really has no limit, and that there are different ways to play the game,” Friedman said. “But your strategy is only as good as your ability to come up with the correct response once you hit that signaling button.”
Holzhauer typically had no problem with either the buzzer or knowing the answers, though he was bested on the episode broadcast Monday by Emma Boettcher, a University of Chicago librarian who won by nearly $22,000. Friedman, who has been executive producer of since 1999, described Holzhauer as a bit “shell shocked” that his Jeopardy! run was finally over.
Seeing him leave was an emotional experience, Friedman said, as the crew all got to know him over the weeks on the show.
Even host Alex Trebek got choked up at the end of the episode.
Meanwhile, given that Holzhauer’s streak happened when spoilers of all kinds run rampant on social media, Friedman was grateful the results weren’t leaked much earlier. After all, although contestants have to sign non-disclosure agreements, the hundreds in the studio audience are simply asked not to tell the results.
“We were pleased and surprised that nothing leaked out before this past weekend. I think that speaks for the respect that people in studio audience have for the show,” Friedman said. “That part of it was very much appreciated.”

Texto completo: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's indictment under the Espionage Act is so controversial that at least two of his prosecutors argued against the decision to indict. Significantly, we know this because it was leaked to news media.
Leaks to the media are as much of a Washington routine as the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival. So are internal debates between members of the same prosecution team.
But the Assange dispute is a higher-stakes argument than most. He is the first publisher in any medium to face criminal prosecution under the 1917 Espionage Act for publishing classified information, even though newspapers have routinely published government secrets that have been leaked to them, including some by WikiLeaks.
In this case, an enormous trove of classified documents was provided to WikiLeaks in 2010 by Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst who later went to prison for the leaks.
Until now, the Espionage Act has been used to prosecute spies and employees with classified clearances who violated their oath by leaking to the press. But federal prosecutors have avoided using it to prosecute journalists for receiving or publishing those leaks.
Contrary to popular belief, they were not doing this simply to be nice to the media. Although judges have sent to jail for contempt some reporters who refused to reveal their sources, prosecution under the Espionage Act raises the ante by treating journalists the same as spies. In other words, prosecutors could be stepping over the line into the criminalization of journalism, a direct violation of what most of us consider to be a First Amendment right.
I say "most of us" because this argument has never been fully tested in the courts. As one legal scholar, Steve Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor and specialist in national security law, said in a 2017 interview with Just Security, "the statute is old and ambiguous," produced in the political heat of World War I Washington "and not drafted with the kind of specificity that usually characterizes speech-restricting statutes that survive constitutional challenge."
In his 2010 testimony about WikiLeaks before the House Judiciary Committee, Vladeck suggested that the law should be fine-tuned, for example, to limit prosecutions to those who specifically intend their disclosure to harm national security or benefit a foreign power.
But under existing law, President Donald Trump's Justice Department has gone where President Barack Obama and Eric Holder, his attorney general, decided after long consideration and internal debate to avoid.
And Obama and Holder, let us not forget, were no softies in pursuing leaks. Obama's Justice Department subpoenaed the phone records of AP journalists. It went after Fox News reporter James Rosen, naming him as a "co-conspirator" in a leak about North Korea's nuclear program. It picked up where the George W. Bush administration left off in pursuing The New York Times' James Risen's source in the espionage case of former CIA employee Jeffrey Sterling.
But the Obama administration pulled back in the president's second term after Holder held meetings with press freedom organizations, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, of which I'm a board member.
Holder assured us at the time that he had no intention to lock up journalists. The Trump administration appears to be leaning in the other direction in the Assange case. "The department takes seriously the role of journalists in our democracy," John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's National Security Division, told reporters when he announced the indictment May 23. "But Julian Assange is no journalist. This is made plain by the totality of his conduct as alleged in the indictment."
But who is to decide these days who's a journalist and who isn't? Demers, like many others, judges Assange's "conduct" to be unbecoming of a good journalist. It may not be his intention, but do we want government officials to tell us who is and isn't a journalist, as they do in countries that license journalists?
Having participated in numerous discussions on this topic since the rise of the internet age in the 1990s, I hear the question of who's a journalist in the same way that a Supreme Court justice defined obscenity: I know it when I see it. I see Assange as a journalist, although an often disturbingly and even dangerously freewheeling example of the breed.
If the Trump administration continues its pursuit of the Australia-born Assange under a law intended to capture and punish spies, it could ultimately set a dangerous precedent to be settled by the Supreme Court, where the outcome would be unpredictable. And prosecutors similarly should be concerned about pitting press freedom against government accountability in a bruising constitutional battle.
Assange may fall way short of being a model journalist, but pursuing him as a spy only makes bad matters worse.

Sephora's brush with irked R&amp;B singer shows dollar value of diversity

Texto completo: Having a Grammy-nominated R&B singer tell her 2.7 million Twitter followers that a Sephora clerk had flagged her as a potential shoplifter could have been a branding nightmare for the cosmetics boutique.
Instead, the Paris-based company turned it into an opportunity. It's closing all its U.S. stores on Wednesday, June 5, for an hour of inclusivity training, a move that telegraphs to a large and lucrative market of millennial shoppers that it not only values their business, it shares their values.
While the session echoes the response of Seattle-based Starbucks to a situation with similarly racial overtones in 2018, Sephora says it was planned months earlier to coincide with its "We Belong to Something Beautiful" marketing campaign, which emphasizes beauty across race and gender boundaries in contrast to the fashion industry's oft-criticized embrace of a thin, white, and youthful female aesthetic.
The timing was fortuitous, to say the least. Now shoppers who might have been turned off by the experience that singer SZA, who was born Solána Imani Rowe, recounted on Twitter on April 30 can see Sephora and its 460 stores in the Americas from a more flattering angle.
Not only are they more likely to keep shopping there, those who frequented Sephora's competitors might now give it a try, said Eric Yaverbaum, who runs New York-based Ericho Communications and has 35 years of experience in marketing and public relations.
"I know a lot more about them today than I did yesterday, and it's all positive," he told the Washington Examiner. "If there were products in Sephora that competed with products I bought, I would go there now."
More broadly, Sephora's training shows the growing emphasis that businesses including retailers place on attracting millennials, the 92 million people born between 1980 and 2000 who make up the largest generation in U.S. history, outnumbering even baby boomers.
So-called digital natives, they're prone to using technology for both networking and comparison shopping, according to research by investment bank Goldman Sachs. That makes staying abreast of social media narratives crucial for companies they frequent, and sheds light on why SZA — who, with a 1990 birthdate, is a millennial herself — tweeted about her trip to a Sephora in California and why her comment drew 63,000 likes and more than 8,000 retweets.
"We had a long talk," SZA tweeted, referring to store personnel and musing about why she couldn't simply "buy her FENTY," referring to fellow singer Rihanna's beauty brand, in peace. Nominated for five Grammy awards, SZA sang a duet on the 2018 hit "All the Stars," the lead single from the "Black Panther" movie.
Though the incident wasn't the genesis of Sephora's campaign, it "does reinforce why belonging is now more important than ever," said a spokesperson for Sephora, a division of the French LVMH conglomerate that controls luxury brands including wines such as Dom Pérignon and Veuve Clicquot as well as fashion labels such as Givenchy, Christian Dior, and singer/actress Rihanna's FENTY.
Sephora's plan to close its U.S. stores, distribution centers, call centers, and corporate office for a one-hour inclusivity workshop with 16,000 employees was in development for over six months, the company spokesperson said. "We’ll be discussing what it means to belong, across many different lenses that include, but are not limited to, gender identity, race and ethnicity, age, abilities, and more."
While the training itself may not transform behavior, as a Harvard sociologist told the New York Times, it's nonetheless an improvement and represents far more than simple public-relations gloss, Yaverbaum said.
"We’re seeing the immense power social media influencers wield to change the conversation around a particular brand," he explained. "These brands are making conscious decisions to go in favor of younger buyers."
In the case of Seattle-based Starbucks, executives not only closed stores for a half-day of anti-bias training in May 2018, after a video of the wrongful arrest of two black men in one of the chain's coffeehouses went viral, they hired outside consultants for advice on diversity efforts.
"Will a day of diversity training change people's opinions completely? Probably not," Yaverbaum said. "Will it change the way they might act in public? Maybe. Will it help a brand with a market they're trying to resonate with? Absolutely."

Brad Rock: If a Team USA call comes, Donovan Mitchell should just say no

Texto completo: SALT LAKE CITY — For those believing the Jazz could one day win a championship, the prospect of Donovan Mitchell joining Team USA for this summer’s FIBA World Cup should be disconcerting, if not alarming.
The Jazz don’t need another Dante Exum, and Mitchell doesn’t need another distracting summer. Here’s what Mitchell needs: five months with no major engagements and a lot of carefully scripted workouts.
The opportunity to play against first-rate competition — if named to Team USA for this summer’s World Cup — would be a growth experience for Mitchell. But he does that every year.
It’s called the NBA.
He won’t see better competition from Japan or Tunisia than he sees every night from the Warriors and Rockets, or even the Hawks and Suns.
The chance to represent his country would be cool unless, like Exum, he went down with an avoidable injury. Mitchell owes it to his fans and his employer not to risk injury via a side gig. His loyalty belongs with the people who sign his everyday paycheck.
The Jazz guard’s name arose last weekend when New York Times reporter Marc Stein tweeted about a possible invitation. There’s no denying it would be a thrill to follow in the footsteps of Karl Malone, John Stockton, Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer, who played in international competition. The chance to be on the same team as today’s finest players makes it doubly enticing.
It would be understandable if Mitchell considered such a proposal. He is built for marketing stardom as well as for basketball success. The two-year veteran could charm the scowl off Walt Kowalski. The fact he has a lucrative shoe deal further drives the narrative. The Mitchell brand would have international reach.
Winning on a world stage with other stars would be good, but winding up in a hospital wouldn’t. Playing to a worldwide audience is cool, but Mitchell already is doing that. He’s in the finest basketball league in the world. Prestigious as an FIBA World Cup championship might be, it’s not bigger than winning an NBA championship.
If Mitchell wants to enhance his brand, an NBA title would do the trick.
Not everyone that plays international competition gets injured. But Exum has had a disheartening career since tearing his ACL in a 2015 game against Slovenia.
Mitchell needs one-on-one tutoring, even now, and most importantly he needs to do it in a controlled environment.
These days, filling out a Team USA roster is iffy. An invitation isn’t a calling, the way it was in the 1992 Olympics when 11 of the world’s 12 best players showed up. That year Malone, Stockton, Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Scottie Pippen, Charles Barkley, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, etc. said yes — gladly and unanimously.
They comprised the greatest talent assembly in the game’s history.
Selecting an American team nowadays is like picking a car off the lot. Sometimes you have to do without some of the options.
By the time the 2016 Olympics arrived, a host of stars deferred as they rested/healed/relaxed. Damian Lillard, Anthony Davis, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant, Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, John Wall, Kawhi Leonard, LeBron James and Harden declined for various reasons. This year Rudy Gobert has said he’ll play for France and Joe Ingles is on Australia’s roster.
To learn three Jazz players might take the risk is enough to give Jazz VP Dennis Lindsey hives.
The Jazz don’t openly oppose their players in these matters. The message is that players can follow their conscience. Some believe Mitchell’s inclusion on the national team would help recruit talent to Utah. Maybe. But winning an NBA championship is the best recruiting tool of all.
Mitchell went many directions last summer, with good intentions. This year he should be focused only on upping his game, improving his conditioning, working on small details. Losing in the first round of the playoffs this year was understandable, but consecutive years would be unacceptable.
Mitchell is noted for “leaving it all on the court” when he competes.
Great.
Just so he doesn’t leave it all in China.

James Holzhauer is (finally) unseated as 'Jeopardy!' champion; how did it all come down?

Texto completo: Spoiler alert: The following contains the outcome of Monday's episode of "Jeopardy!"
And that’s a wrap.
“Jeopardy!” contestant James Holzhauer lost on Monday, ending his 33-day run on the game show, during which he took home a total of $2,464,216, including $2,000 for his second-place finish to new champ Emma Boettcher. He came up just $56,484 shy of besting the all-time record set by Ken Jennings for non-tournament play.
“Nobody likes to lose,” Holzhauer said in an interview with the New York Times published Monday. “But I’m very proud of how I did, and I really exceeded my own expectations for the show. So I don’t feel bad about it. ”
In a statement released by Sony Pictures Television, which produces the show, Holzhauer credited Boettcher, who "dominated her warmup games that day, and I knew she would make an extremely tough challenger. I’m proud that it took a top-level player at her absolute best to eliminate me. ” He said he "never really believed I could win 75 shows, but I definitely thought I had a great shot at Ken’s cash winnings record. ”
Holzhauer, 34, made a splash during his winning streak on the show by taking the board by storm, going for the highest-dollar questions first and hunting for Daily Doubles. Then, he bet big. The professional sports gambler from Las Vegas explained to the Times that his huge advantage on the trivia show was that he wasn’t afraid to risk his winnings.

"The fact that I win and lose money all the time helps desensitize me, so I can write down $60,000 as the Final Jeopardy wager and not be trembling at the thought of losing that money," he said.
Except on Monday, when he didn't. Holzhauer, along with his two rivals, gave the correct response ("Who is Marlowe"?) to the clue in the category Shakespeare's Time: The line “A great reckoning in a little room” in “As You Like It” is usually taken to refer to this author’s premature death. But with $23,400 going into the round – $3,200 below Emma's total – he wagered only $1,399, a "modest (bet) for the first time," as host Alex Trebek termed it, and finished with $24,799.
Boettcher, who led going into the round, bet big, wagering $20,201, and finished the victor with $46,801. Holzhauer immediately approached her with a high-five.
Overall, it was a remarkably competitive game, as the three contestants collectively got only one incorrect response.
During his nearly seven-week run on the show, Holzhauer crossed the $1 million mark on Day 15 and the $2 million mark on Day 27, becoming only the second person in the game show's 35-year history (excluding an earlier NBC version) to reach the feat in regular-season play. He first appeared on April 4, and was absent only for a two-week Teachers Tournament that aired in mid-May. But his final episodes were taped in early April.

He also playfully teased early word of his exit on Twitter, with a reference to the "Drake Curse," a reference to the singer as bad-luck omen: "Knew I shouldn't have invited @Drake to the @Jeopardy taping. "
Computer programmer-turned-author Jennings made off with $2,520,700 over 74 games in 2004, one year after the show stopped limiting champions to five-day reigns and allowed them to compete until they lost.
Holzhauer’s financial haul is even more impressive given the pace of his winnings. He holds the top 15 daily money totals, including the one-day record of $131,127 set April 17. Jennings averaged $34,064 during his 74-game run.
In a recent Q&A with Wired, Jennings said he was "gobsmacked" by Holzhauer's hot streak.
"I thought I had seen everything on 'Jeopardy!' And this is something I would have thought was just impossible," Jennings said. "He’s maximizing money. He can make two or three times what any other player ever has with that same level of play, which again is top-shelf. He’s as good as anybody. "
But this is not the last we've seen on Holzhauer: He'll be back on the show's next tournament of champions.

Texto completo: When Carter Page learned in April 2017 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had obtained a secret court order to listen in on his communications, the Washington Post asked him about it. Mr. Page, the paper reported, "compared surveillance of him to the eavesdropping that the FBI and Justice Department conducted against civil rights leader Martin Luther King."
Everyone had a good laugh. "Never ever, ever, compare yourself in any way whatsoever to Martin Luther King," sneered the Post's Jonathan Capehart. "Ever."
Certainly Mr. Page would have been ridiculous if he meant he was of King's stature. But that wasn't what he had contended. All he suggested was that he, like King, had been a target of an FBI counterintelligence operation run amok.
Now a new report on the FBI's surreptitious tapings of King makes it harder to see the difference between what J. Edgar Hoover's FBI did with King and what James Comey's FBI did with Mr. Page. In an article in Standpoint magazine, David Garrow, author of a Pulitzer-winning biography of King, reports summaries of the FBI recordings collected on the civil-rights leader. The article has stoked a furor for some of the unflattering details reported about King, for example that he "looked on and laughed" while a fellow pastor forcibly raped a female parishioner.
But while the details of King's sexual behavior have attracted most of the attention, the parallels with Mr. Page may be more illuminating. Remember, the FBI sought a warrant on Mr. Page from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on the claim that the former Trump campaign associate was "an agent of a foreign power," namely Russia. Yet Mr. Page is one of the few targets of the investigation to have emerged without ever being charged with anything.
The surveillance of King likewise began as a national-security matter. In a Rose Garden conversation, President John F. Kennedy told King he needed to cut ties with one of his closest advisers, Stanley Levison, a former financier for the Communist Party USA. When King refused to cut Levison loose, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy authorized the FBI to wiretap King.
In his book "A Higher Loyalty," Mr. Comey writes that the King case illuminates how "a legitimate counterintelligence mission" could morph into "an unchecked, vicious campaign of harassment and extralegal attack on the civil rights leader and others." To "drive the message home," Mr. Comey writes that as FBI director he kept on his desk a copy of the October 1963 memo, written by Hoover and signed by RFK, approving the King wiretaps.
"I kept the Hoover memo there not to make a critical statement from Hoover or Kennedy, but to make a statement about the value of oversight and constraint," Mr. Comey writes. "I have no doubt that Hoover and Kennedy thought they were doing the right thing. What they lacked was meaningful testing of their assumptions. There was nothing to check them."
Cut to today, when Attorney General William Barr is bringing that "oversight" and "meaningful testing" to decisions such as the one to listen in on Mr. Page. Far from applauding what he himself once called for, Mr. Comey now accuses Mr. Barr of "sliming his own department."
Mr. Comey has also taken issue with Mr. Barr's use of the word "spying" to describe the FBI's behavior. He's not alone. At the Senate hearing where Mr. Barr first used it, Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz asked if he wanted to rephrase because "when the attorney general of the United States uses the word 'spying,' its rather provocative and in my view unnecessarily inflammatory." Meanwhile, the New York Times accused Mr. Barr of using a "charged word."
So here's the question for all those who assert that Mr. Barr was wrong to use the word "spying": Would they use it to describe what the FBI did to Martin Luther King?
We already know the answer to that one. The Washington Post used the word "spying" often to describe what happened to King -- without scare quotes. Ditto for the New York Times and others. The word was not considered "charged" until April 10, after Mr. Barr used it.
Just one example. Here's Charles M. Blow's lead sentence in a 2013 Times column: "The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I Have a Dream' so disturbed the American power structure that the F.B.I. started spying on him in what The Washington Post called 'one of its biggest surveillance operations in history.'"
In an interview with CBS on Friday, Mr. Barr sounded almost Comeyish when he spoke of what might have led FBI leaders astray in their investigation into alleged Trump ties with Russia. "Sometimes," he said, "people can convince themselves that what they're doing is in the higher interest, the better good."
Sooner or later, Mr. Barr will sort it out. Meanwhile, it may be a good moment for current director Christopher Wray to install permanently at FBI headquarters a copy of the application for the FISA warrant on Mr. Page -- signed by his predecessor, Mr. Comey. Maybe it will help "drive home" the need for "oversight and constraint."

Texto completo: While first-time travelers to the Steel City may be intrigued by coleslaw and fries on those famous Primanti's sandwiches, there are a few Pittsburghers who are plain sick and tired of the fabled staple.
For those scoping out a new favorite hoagie joint? There's a chatbot for that - aptly named PGHBot.
When asked, "Where can I get a good sandwich that isn't Primanti's?" through a text message, the bot suggested DeLuca's in the Strip District, describing it as "a local favorite old style diner." The bot even recommended arriving early, as lines are sometimes out the door.
Developed by ConvMind, an Oakland-based startup, PGHBot is meant to be a friendly helper to travelers and residents alike. And it's free.
"We wanted to create a local insider AI system that allowed people to learn more about Pittsburgh," said Tony Zhao, a co-founder of the company.
To use artificial intelligence to accomplish that, the team had to rethink the way humans and computers have traditionally interacted - combining history and some new approaches.
The birth of chatbots
Chatbots, broadly known as computer programs designed to converse with humans, aren't exactly the new kid on the block. They date back to the 1960s.
Joseph Weizenbaum, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston, built a program in 1966 called Eliza, named for the heroine in the 1964 film "My Fair Lady," according to MIT.
Eliza, the first chatbot, was completed in 1966 at MIT. Though it wasn't able to truly understand conversations, it was seen as a possible virtual therapist.
Initially, he created it to show the superficial nature of human-computer communication.
Except, to his bewilderment, people developed human-like feelings for the computer program - even including Mr. Weizenbaum's own secretary.
Experts hypothesized that Eliza could be used as a sort of artificial therapist, helping those suffering from psychological issues. Still, it was too early; Eliza could not really understand the conversations.
By 1995, an Eliza-inspired chatbot called Alice was "born." Using heuristic pattern matching rules - which basically allow a system to decide how to respond to specific inputs such as information that a user types to a chatbot - Alice represented a significant leap. It even inspired Apple's Siri voice assistant.
Market talk
Today, there are myriad chatbots and messaging apps on websites like Facebook used for marketing and business applications. Virtually all smartphones now have built-in voice assistants such as Siri, Bixby and Google Assistant.
Alexa and other smart speakers are increasingly entering households, helping to give weather data or just engage in casual conversation. According to U.K.-based Juniper Research, up to 8 billion voice assistants will be in use by 2023, up from 2.5 billion in 2018.
Sales of those intelligent assistants brought in about $2.3 billion in 2018, according to Zion Market Research, based in India. It expects that figure to rise to $19.6 billion by 2025. The market for chatbots, by contrast, is expected to reach $1.25 billion by 2025, according to Grand View Research, a San Francisco-based market research firm.
In part, that's credited to advancements in natural language processing, a type of AI that helps computers understand human speech.
Carnegie Mellon University's Language Technologies Institute is a leader in that space - and it's where some of ConvMind's researchers come from.
The 'human element'
The usual technology underlying most bots and voice assistants like Siri is limited, Mr. Zhao said.
Programmers must "hard code" the logic into the bot, he said, predicting situations that could arise during conversation.
That could mean assuming that users will ask for this weekend's concert lineup. But if the coders haven't set up the system to respond to questions about where to park, perhaps, or where the best nearby bars are, the voice assistant can't properly respond.
In 2016, Mr. Zhao helped build out a new approach - called intuitive dialogue systems - at CMU, where he earned his Ph.D in artificial intelligence.
It's all about understanding the context of the conversation, he explained, not just responding to one-off queries. "What separates it [from other bots] is that it learns about the person it's talking to and it remembers your preferences," Mr. Zhao said.
Robin Levy, the lead user experience and interface designer, said she has kept the bot's "human element" at the forefront during development.
"The people that did put in the data . are all from Pittsburgh, [people] who have opinions," she said. "It's a really diverse team, with ages ranging from their 20s to almost 50. With that, we were able to create this 'personality' that can interact on a much more human level."
Accordingly, PGHBot recommended a few different bar options when asked where to grab a beer: Carson City Saloon in the South Side, Redbeard's on Sixth in the Cultural District and Stinky's Bar and Grill in Lawrenceville.
Users don't have to set up an account. You can text, chat on Facebook or visit PGHBot on its website.
Mr. Zhao said avoiding an app was intentional - travelers don't want to take the time to download it onto their phone for a few days.
In the future, ConvMind plans to roll out bots for other cities. Think: NYBot or LABot.
The immediate business model, though, is to create custom bots for festivals, museums and organizations as a paid service. They can also use PGHBot as a marketing channel, announcing special events and collecting data on what customers are interested in.
Can I help you?
Through artificial intelligence, PGHBot learns as it collects more data. So far, the ConvMind team has logged at least 30,000 conversations, Mr. Zhao said, and there are at least 300 businesses in its database.
Most companies developing such conversation tools don't yet use the advanced technology that PGHBot employs, he said.
Google is experimenting in the space with Duplex, a recommendation tool that is part of the company's Google Assistant voice technology. Through AI, Duplex can automatically call a restaurant to make a reservation for its users, then talk back and forth with whoever answers the phone, settling on a good time and the size of the party.
Duplex is supposed to make life easier for consumers; in the future, it may be used to set up doctor appointments or haircuts.
It may not always be AI doing the work, though. Google told the New York Times that 25 percent of Duplex calls to restaurants come from humans.
At that rate, it appears AI bots aren't quite perfect yet.
For its part, PGHBot has its own missteps.
Asking it where to grab a pierogi is only partly successful: the first recommendation was Pierogies Plus in McKees Rocks, but the second one was for Casbah, a Mediterranean restaurant in Shadyside that sadly does not offer the pillowy dumplings.
And when queried about the coolest bridges, PGHBot responded: "Aw! You're making me blush! What else can I help you find?"

Texto completo: Forty percent of all working-age Americans sometimes struggle to pay their monthly bills. br data-css-regions-fragment-of="1196">
There is no place in the country where a family supported by one minimum-wage worker with a full-time job can live and afford a 2-bedroom apartment at the average fair-market rent.
Given the pressure to earn enough to make ends meet, you would think that low-paid workers would be clamoring for raises. But this is not always the case.
Because so many American jobs don't earn enough to pay for food, housing and other basic needs, many low-wage workers rely on public benefits that are only available to people in need, such as housing vouchers and Medicaid, to pay their bills.
Earning a little more money may not automatically increase their standard of living if it boosts their income to the point where they lose access to some or all of those benefits. That's because the value of those lost benefits may outweigh their income gains.
I have researched this dynamic, which experts often call the "cliff effect," for years to learn why workers weren't succeeding at retaining their jobs following job training programs. Chief among the one step forward, two steps back problems the cliff effect causes: Low-paid workers can become reluctant to earn more money due to a fear that they will get worse off instead of better.
Trapped
br data-css-regions-fragment-of="1203">
"My supervisor wants to promote me," a woman who gets housing assistance through the federal Section 8 housing voucher program, who I'll call Josie, told me. "If my pay goes up, my rent will go up too. I don't know if I'll be able to afford my apartment," Josie, a secretary at a Boston hospital, said.
These vouchers are available to Americans facing economic hardship, based on multiple criteria, including their income. Josie was worried that the bump up in paythat she'd get from the promotion would not make up for the loss of help she gets to pay her rent.
Given the possibility of a downside, many Americans in this situation decide it's better to decline what on the surface looks like a good opportunity to escape poverty.
This uncertainty leads workers like Josie to forgo raises rather than take the risk of getting poorer while working harder. Having to stress out about potentially losing benefits that keep a roof over their heads and food on their table prolongs their own financial instability.
The pain isn't just personal. Josie's whole family misses out if she passes on an opportunity to earn more. The government loses a chance to stop using taxpayer dollars to cover benefits to someone who might not otherwise need them. The hospital can't take full advantage of Josie's proven talents.
Not always
Some low-paid workers do get farther behind when they should be getting ahead following a raise. But getting higher pay doesn't always make anyone worse off. Whether it does or not depends on a lot of intersecting factors, like the local cost of living, the size of the raise, the size of the family and the benefits the worker receives.
The cliff effect is something social workers see their clients encounter all the time. And it's maddeningly impossible to figure out for the people experiencing it and researchers like me alike.
Some benefits, notably the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation's largest program designed to alleviate hunger, do include some incentives for recipients to earn more. SNAP, as today's version of food stamps is known, tapers its phaseout for eligibility as incomes grow, rather than rendering people ineligible as soon as their pay crosses a single threshold.
But low-wage workers, such as those in food service, hospitality and retail have no way of knowing what to expect if they get SNAP benefits in combination with other government programs, such as housing vouchers and Medicaid.
At the heart of this problem is that the help millions Americans derive from the nation's safety net comes from a fragmented system. Sorting out the repercussions of a higher income is nearly impossible because the safety net consists of a wide array of benefits programs administered by federal, state and local agencies. Each program and administrator has its own criteria, rules and restrictions.
Because that trepidation is sometimes unfounded, my colleagues at Project Hope Boston, a multi-service agency focused on moving the city's families up and out of poverty, and I started to do something about it.
Fixing it
To help families assess risks tied to the cliff effect, we advised the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance, which oversees state-administered safety net programs, to create a digital tool. Social workers are already using a preliminary version of it to show low-wage workers what they can probably expect to happen to their benefits if they earn more money.
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts plans to put this tool online for all to use by the summer of 2019.

After plugging in information like how many members are in the household, what benefits everyone receives and the costs of their regular expenses like rent, child care and medical bills, they become better able to make informed choices about their career opportunity based on their family's personal financial situation.
But workers need more than just a tool; they need help getting over the cliff. We also help workforce development programs implement the state's new Learn to Earn initiative, which gives low-income families the financial coaching they need to make educated decisions that could affect their bottom line.
This problem is becoming increasingly urgent because dozens of states, cities and counties are enforcing higher minimum wages, and employers are voluntarily raising pay as well, including Target and Amazon. Some places, including Massachusetts and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul in Minnesota, are even phasing in $15-an-hour minimums.
But the reality is that even after some of the biggest minimum wage increases enacted at the state level lately, many families are not earning enough to pay for housing and other basic needs without help - for which they may no longer qualify. Several states, including Colorado and Florida, are seeking solutions.
This complicated and frustrating challenge is just one symptom of an overarching problem. In addition to higher wages, it will take major policy changes, like making child care more universally available and affordable, to offset the skyrocketing costs of living for American workers.

Texto completo: SAN JOSE, Calif.—Apple Inc. sought to tout itself as a digital-privacy crusader with an anonymous login system and tools that prevent apps from tracking a user's location, a push that is designed to further differentiate it from Google and Facebook Inc., which have built their fortunes on tracking user activity and behavior.
At a gathering Monday of about 6,000 software developers here, the iPhone maker said its mobile operating system coming this fall, iOS 13, will include an Apple sign-in capability that allows people to log into apps without revealing any personal information. It said users would be able to generate automated and random email addresses provided by Apple rather than provide their own.
"It's a fast, easy way to sign in without all the tracking," said Apple software chief Craig Federighi onstage at the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference. He showed the "Sign in with Apple" feature alongside similar offerings from Facebook and Google, which he said could share user information in a way that compromised privacy.
Apple has weaponized privacy over the past year, marketing it to combat threats posed by rivals increasingly elbowing into its core iPhone business. Last month, Google released a $400 smartphone that it says offers capabilities similar to those of an iPhone at a fraction of the price, and Facebook is working to develop private messaging, payments and e-commerce that could diminish the value of Apple's iOS.
Apple is also seeking to further separate itself from its peers as the U.S. government ramps up its scrutiny of tech giants' power. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the government's antitrust enforcers, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, are splitting up oversight of tech companies including Google and Facebook over competition concerns. Facebook already faces an FTC investigation over privacy issues.
Amid the skirmishes over privacy, Apple is transitioning from an iPhone-driven company into one powered by a suite of services, such as streaming-music subscriptions, app-store sales and mobile payments. At its developers conference, Apple turned the spotlight back to its other devices beyond the iPhone, introducing new software and services to deepen the appeal of its iPad, smartwatch and Mac businesses. It also bolstered many of its apps, including improvements to Messages that put it in more direct competition with Facebook's apps.
Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has stressed privacy by criticizing Google, Facebook and other companies as cavalier in collecting user information. He has cast Apple as pro-privacy, saying it is in the business of selling devices while its peers are in the business of monetizing their customers by gathering data and selling ads.
The company has amplified that message by spending more than $54 million on a TV ad campaign that promotes the privacy offered by iPhones, using the tagline: "If privacy matters in your life, it should matter to the phone your life is on." The campaign is about half of Apple's TV ad spending so far this year, according to the ad-tracking company iSpot.tv.
Facebook and Google have pushed back with privacy promises of their own. Facebook this year said it is going to provide encrypted messaging and encourage small-group chats . Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai sniped at Apple in a New York Times editorial that "privacy cannot be a luxury good" available to people who buy expensive devices.
Apple said its newest mobile-operating system will give users more options for how they share location data with apps, including an option to only share location information once.
It also said it is teaming up with security-camera companies to provide more private video tools for people who use cameras to monitor home security.
Though the focus of this event is usually dominated by Apple's newest iPhone software, the company emphasized improvements to its other gadgets. The iPad is getting its own operating system, iPadOS, with new capabilities that make the tablet more capable of performing like a computer. It will have simple copy-and-paste functions, a desktop mode for its Safari web browser and the ability to plug in a thumb drive.
The Mac is retiring the iTunes app, which made its debut 18 years ago, and splitting its functionality across Apple's Music, TV and Podcast. The iTunes brand will continue to exist on the iPhone, and users will still be able to download songs through an iTunes Store tab, the company said.
The Apple Watch is getting its own app store, liberating it further from the iPhone where app downloads were previously managed. It also is adding new health capabilities, including the ability to alert users if the environmental noise around them poses a potential problem for their hearing health.
Apple introduced new programming tools for developers that are designed to simplify the process of developing apps for the Mac, watch and iPad. The 2.2 million iPhone apps available in the App Store dwarf the 20,000 Watch apps currently offered. Analysts say that discrepancy limits the utility of the Apple Watch and is part of the reason smartwatch sales have lagged behind the iPhone and iPad.
The company also sought to promote its growing services business, showing the first trailer from one of the company's new TV shows, "For All Mankind," a show from Ronald D. Moore about the space race. The show will be available when Apple launches its streaming-video subscription service this fall.
Apple needs strong sales of those devices and its services to help counter the downturn in its iPhone business. The company in April posted its first back-to-back drop in quarterly sales and profit as sales of the iPhone, which accounts for about two-thirds of total revenue, fell 16% to $83 billion for the first half of the company's fiscal year.
Although the focus of the conference was on software, Apple introduced a new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer designed for complicated and intense tasks. The computer, which will start at about $6,000, includes a new Intel Xeon processor and system memory of up to 1.5 terabytes. A 32-inch LCD screen with a 6K retina display will cost another $5,000.

Impeachment hangs over Trump; top Dems want public support

Texto completo: The threat of impeachment hangs over the White House, but it also vexes House Democrats wary of taking next steps against President Trump without broader public support.
Leading Democrats provided a snapshot Sunday of the party wrestling with the impeachment questions posed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's findings in the Russia investigation. One top leader, Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, the Democratic whip, said the president may well face an impeachment inquiry in the House. Another, Representative Adam Schiff of California suggested it's not likely soon, if at all.
"We're not there yet," Schiff said on ABC's "This Week."
Speaker Nancy Pelosi has stopped short of pursuing an impeachment inquiry against Trump despite an increasing number of lawmakers, including some 2020 presidential contenders, clamoring to do so. She is wary of embarking on a politically divisive debate that she worries would all but drown out the House's policy agenda and campaign promises. Lawmakers heard mixed views during a recess week back home and Pelosi faced those favoring impeachment during the weekend California Democrats' party meeting.
Instead, six House committees are probing deeply into Trump's business dealings, his running of the government, and whether or not the president obstructed Mueller's investigation.
"What I have said time and time again is, Mueller has developed the grounds for impeachment. The House has to determine the timing for impeachment. There's a big difference," Clyburn said on CNN's "State of the Union."
"We are trying to take our time and do this right," Clyburn said. "So I don't see this as being out of whack with what the people's aspirations are."
Schiff, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, signaled that the House may ultimately decline to pursue impeachment.

Pentagon chief not planning USS John McCain probe
The Pentagon doesn't need to investigate a White House directive for the Navy to move the warship USS John S. McCain from view before President Trump's recent trip to Japan, acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan said Sunday.
The White House military office requested that the Seventh Fleet keep the warship "hidden from view," Shanahan told reporters en route to South Korea. But the directive wasn't carried out, and "all ships remained in normal configuration during the visit," he said.
"No, I am not planning any IG investigation," Shanahan said when asked if the inspector-general would investigate. No investigation was needed "because there was nothing really carried out," he said.
Trump said on Thursday that a "well-meaning" person appears to have made the request, but said he personally would not have done so. The ship carries the name of the late senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who was a frequent critic of Trump, as well as his father and grandfather.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, on "Fox News Sunday," called the USS McCain incident "much ado about nothing."
The unidentified staff member behind the request wouldn't be disciplined for asking if the ship should be visible given the president's "well known" feelings about the late senator, he said.

Florida congressman hit by a thrown drink cup
A Florida congressman who frequently appears on television supporting President Trump was struck by a thrown drink as he left a town hall.
US Representative Matt Gaetz wasn't injured Saturday when he was struck by a plastic cup lobbed by a protester in Pensacola, Fla.
Video posted online shows the second-term Republican leaving a coffee house while about 20 protesters chant their opposition. The cup struck him in the back.
Amanda Kondrat'yev was charged with misdemeanor battery and released on $1,000 bond. She briefly ran against Gaetz in 2016 before dropping out.
Gaetz tweeted about the incident saying, "Clearly it takes more than a drink to slow down our great team."

Biden declares LGBTQ rights his No. 1 legislative priority
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden declared Saturday that the Equality Act would be his top legislative priority, an effort to enshrine LGBTQ protections into the nation's labor and civil rights laws.
The former vice president shared his hopes of signing the legislation as part of a keynote address to hundreds of activists at the Human Rights Campaign's annual Ohio gala on the first day of Pride Month. In a half-hour at the lectern, his remarks ranged from emotional tributes to his audience and their personal endurance to condemnations of President Trump.
"It's wrong and it is immoral what they're doing," Biden said of the Trump administration. Among other Trump polices, he cited attempts to bar transgender troops in the US military, allow individuals in the medical field to refuse to treat LGBTQ individuals, and allow homeless shelters to refuse transgender occupants.
"Just like with racial justice and women's rights, we are seeing pushback against all the progress we've made toward equality," Biden said.
The Equality Act would address many such discriminatory practices. It recently passed the Democratic-run House, but will not become law under Trump and the Republican Senate. That means LGBTQ residents in dozens of states are still subject to various forms of discrimination that are either specifically allowed or not barred by state law.
"It will be the first thing I ask to be done," Biden said.
Biden spoke in Ohio, a political battleground he was visiting for the first time since beginning his bid, on the same day that more than a dozen of his rivals were in San Francisco for the California Democratic Convention and a massive MoveOn.org conference.

Sanders after dark: Inside his first 'grass-roots fund-raiser'
Senator Bernie Sanders has long promised to run a different kind of campaign and be a different kind of president. On Saturday night, what was billed as his first “grass-roots fund-raiser" of the 2020 campaign was certainly different, as donor events go.
It was at a nightclub, for one thing. The DJ was spinning a mix that included “Eye of the Tiger," the underdog anthem from the “Rocky" movie series. Tickets were as cheap as $27, for another. There were food trucks out back (tacos and a Taiwanese-Korean blend).
The night had the vibe of a Sanders rally, only smaller, darker, and more intimate, and with booze. Disco balls dangled from the ceiling. When the lights flashed briefly during his remarks, Sanders joked about the special effects.
“Very sophisticated," he deadpanned. “Either that or someone was leaning on the light switch."
People laughed. This was, after all, Sanders' crowd to lose, and he did not lose them, despite some delays before taking the stage.
Sanders has made his rejection of big donors and traditional fund-raisers a centerpiece of his message and, in a field of 23 candidates, has begun scheduling in-person events to keep his grip on small donors as his rivals try to make inroads.

Trump: Jerry West to get Medal of Freedom
President Trump says that Jerry West, the pro basketball great, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
"The Great Jerry West will be receiving our Nation's highest civilian honor, The Presidential Medal of Freedom, for his outstanding career, both on and off the court," according to the Trump Saturday night tweet. West, a member of the basketball Hall of Fame, played guard for the Los Angeles Lakers and played college basketball at West Virginia University. No date was announced for the award for the 81-year-old West.

Texto completo: With sorrow, we mark the passing of Anita Zarate Hall, 91, beloved wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and friend. She passed away peacefully on May 21, 2019 at 10:05 pm.
Anita was born in 1927 in New York City on East 27th Street as the second daughter of Emilio and Tomasa Zarate. She moved to Queens with her family in the 1940s where she met and married William Hall, the love of her life, in 1951. They brought four children into the world and continued to live in Flushing until 1995, when they moved to Hampton, VA. The house on the canal to the Chesapeake Bay was their retirement dream where Bill fished and Anita painted, with many glasses of wine enjoyed on the backyard deck. Watching wildlife and water were a constant pleasure to both. After her husband Bill passed in 2007, Anita continued living in the place they loved until 2017, still insisting on cutting her own grass at 89. She was an avid reader of the entire New York Times until 90. In 2018, her family moved her to Exton, PA to be closer to loved ones.
Anita had a full and interesting life. She worked as an Executive Secretary in Manhattan, then as a nursing assistant, and later, a bookkeeper while raising her four children with Bill. While in her 50's she earned a degree in accounting from Queens College, after which she worked for the NYC Department of Taxation and Finance. After moving to Hampton, she was the accountant for Hall & Associates in Washington, DC, the business started by her sons John and Bill. With a wonderful facility for numbers, she was never off by even a penny in her accounts. She loved to paint, read, and do crossword puzzles and took up piano at age 68. She enjoyed spending time with all her grandchildren, and particularly liked playing chess with her grandson, Chris. She ensured a bond of love and companionship among her children and grandchildren by bringing the family together every year for a beach vacation in the Outer Banks. This member of The Greatest Generation and child of the Depression was strong, loving, intelligent, and possessed a formidable sense of sound ethics - traits she passed on to her children. Throughout their lives, Anita always encouraged and supported her children to be their best. She will be missed.
Anita is survived by her sister Gloria and her brother Tom. She is survived by her children and their spouses/significant others: William and Ilona Hall, John and Patricia Hall, Mary Beth Hall and Stuart Rymph, and Tom Hall and Michelle Montanya. She is survived by seven grandchildren (Jessica, Ryan (and Jen), Elizabeth (and Sarah), Diana (and Ethan), Christopher, Rebecca, and Tara) and one great grandchild (Sean).
A mass of Christian burial will be held for Anita at Saints Philip and James Church, in Exton, PA, on June 10, 2019 at 10:30 am. Inurnment alongside her beloved husband will be at a later date in the Arlington National Cemetery Columbarium.
In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Anita's name to Penn Hospice at (3535 Market Street, Suite 750, Philadelphia, PA 19104; hospice@dev.upenn.edu.; 215-573-1155)

HOW I MADE IT: ALLEN NARCISSE; Lyft regional director revels in being in the driver's seat; 'Our goal is to be the indispensable ride- sharing company for Angelenos,' Allen Narcisse says.

Texto completo: The gig: Allen Narcisse, 42, is Southern California regional director for ride-hailing service Lyft, which is active in 640 cities across the country. He oversees 100 employees and 11 markets in the area, including Los Angeles, San Diego, Orange County and the Inland Empire.
After an underwhelming initial public offering in March, the company finds itself in a critical stretch as it wrestles with Uber for market share. As regional director, Narcisse is tasked with marketing, government relations and ensuring drivers and riders are satisfied.
Family business: Growing up in Des Moines, Narcisse spent summers working at his uncle Jonathan Narcisse's newspaper, the Iowa Bystander. Between copy edits and interview transcriptions, he developed a taste not only for media but for jobs involving many hats.

"I understood how the different aspects fit together. Now, it would be hard for me to work in just one function," he said.
Upping the ante: After graduating from the University of Michigan, he worked as a financial consultant for Arthur Andersen and KPMG International. The exciting world of media beckoned, however, and at the urging of his uncle, he applied to Harvard Business School until he was accepted.
In 2005, he packed his bags for Los Angeles. An internship with CBS led to a digital strategy job with the Los Angeles Times, which led to a managing role at Hoy, The Times' Spanish-language newspaper. Next came a global strategy position with Paramount Pictures.
"It gave me a broader perspective on the city's success and challenges. At Hoy, my delivery area was the size of Ohio," he said, adding that it forced him to think about L.A.'s complex system of transportation, infrastructure and local governments.
One "yes": Soon after, he co-founded a company called Ebyline, which connected freelance writers with publications. His confidence waned as 50 venture capitalists said no, but he used the experience to hone his pitch until he finally heard "yes."
"Entrepreneurs struggle when you have an idea of how you're going to grow, but after you get some initial traction, it's hard to continue that growth. A lot of entrepreneurs try many things at that point, but it's better to focus on what your company does well and what makes it unique rather than diversify."
Flag football's fault: Narcisse sold Ebyline in 2015, and his next career turn came out of left field. On Valentine's Day, he tore his Achilles' tendon during a game of flag football and relied on ride-hailing services for the next few months.
"I couldn't get around, and ride-sharing made things much easier. Now I know how many people they help every day who don't have any other option," he said.
Game plan: He spent two years with UberEats before becoming Lyft's general manager for the Greater Los Angeles area in 2017. Uber controlled most of the market at the time -- and still does. His strategy moving forward has never changed: relationships.
After 2017's deadly Thomas fire burned through Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, he reached out to the community to provide masks, water and free Lyft rides from emergency zones. Now, Narcisse has a strong relationship with the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.
More recently, he worked to partner with venues such as the Hollywood Bowl and Los Angeles Coliseum, offering phone chargers and couches at pickup areas and sending ambassadors to events to aid drivers and riders in an attempt to reduce wait times.
"Our goal is to be the indispensable ride-sharing company for Angelenos," he said.
Long days: For Narcisse, each day begins with meditation. After that, he drops off his 2-year-old daughter at daycare and arrives at Lyft's office in downtown Los Angeles' Arts District around 8:30 a.m.
His days are busy, whether he's meeting with the driver services team or the marketing team or chatting with government officials about the services his company provides. He heads home around 6:30 p.m. but then ends the night with three more hours of work from 8 to 11 p.m.
Growing sustainably: The last two years have seen Narcisse's staff swell to 100 employees from 20. The San Francisco company's rapid growth has come with problems, including a disappointing IPO in March and a nationwide strike in May by Uber and Lyft drivers to protest low wages.
Narcisse said the IPO was a milestone for the company, but regardless of the outcome, his approach doesn't change. Every day, he said, he focuses on serving drivers and building a strong internal team.
For starters, that means listening. In meetings, Narcisse said, he makes sure everyone speaks and stresses that the best idea should win, no matter where it comes from.
When he first came on board, he told his team he wanted to make 5% of decisions. That, he said, empowers his employees and ensures that everyone's voice matters.
Leadership style: Growing up playing team sports, Narcisse always carried a competitive streak. That manifests in many ways in the workplace, whether he's trash-talking after an office basketball shooting game or setting specific goals for each member of his staff.
"An important part of being a leader is setting a course but also providing freedom and flexibility," he said. "My team in San Diego is very different than the teams that run Orange County and the Inland Empire, and they're both highly successful."
Mentors: He credits two former Los Angeles Times colleagues as his greatest role models: former editor Dean Baquet (now executive editor of the New York Times) and former Chief Financial Officer Bob Bellack (now CFO of OnPoint, an online data firm). The former taught him the merit of unmovable principles, and the latter taught him the value of knowing your operation top to bottom.
"I manage as a combination of those two: high principles along with ... being really on top of how your business functions," he said.
Personal: Narcisse lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Sonata, whom he met his first day working at CBS, and their daughter.

Texto completo: What's on TV
THE WEEKLY 10 p.m. on FX. The debut episode of this TV show from The New York Times centers on an article by Erica L. Green and Katie Benner about a school in rural Louisiana that took advantage of racial stereotypes in applications and falsified transcripts to send underprivileged students to elite colleges. Green and Benner are two of the more than 30 reporters featured in the first season of "The Weekly," which looks at one article each week, going behind the scenes for reporting in the United States and around the world. Some episodes later in the season focus on New York City taxi medallions, immigration and terrorism.
LUTHER 8 p.m. on BBC America. This genuinely frightening detective show debuts its fifth season on BBC America on Sunday night. Idris Elba stars as a London detective; the season involves more killings to investigate, a serial killer and a cat-and-mouse chase. "This isn't new territory exactly," Margaret Lyons and Danielle Henderson wrote of the show on The Times's Watching website. "But 'Luther' gets it right, achieving the kind of intensity other cop shows can only dream of."
NOS4A2 10 p.m. on AMC. The author Joe Hill's supernatural third novel comes to TV in this horror series, which casts Zachary Quinto as a demonic ghoul who eats the souls of children to maintain his youth. Ashleigh Cummings plays Vic, a motorcycle-riding young artist who finds herself in a position to try and stop him. Janet Maslin characterized Hill's original novel as "throat-grabbing" in her review for The Times, where she wrote that "'NOS4A2' is full of chills and cliffhangers." Those cliffhangers should translate naturally into an episodic TV format -- hopefully the chills will, too.
What's Streaming
GOOD OMENS Stream on Amazon. In this Amazon mini-series, adapted from the novel by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, the apocalypse comes with a medley of sarcastic jokes -- and a pair of very famous stars. The show brings Michael Sheen and David Tennant together as an angel and a demon who join forces to save the world. Resulting from that pairing is a comedy of unearthly proportions. "What we've got is a great big sprawling six-part movie with 300 different characters, and every scene is in a different place," Tennant recently told The Times. "Even if it's just Michael and I talking on a park bench, we're on a park bench surrounded by Victorian dinosaurs."
MY NEXT GUEST NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION WITH DAVID LETTERMAN Stream on Netflix. The second season of David Letterman's long-form interview show has an impressive slate of guests: Kanye West, Ellen DeGeneres, Tiffany Haddish, Lewis Hamilton and Melinda Gates. Co-starring is Letterman's now-famous beard.

Texto completo: Fox News host Martha MacCallum tore into author Michael Wolff for claiming she shared questions ahead of her on-air interview with then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last year.
On her evening program Friday, MacCallum reacted to an interview with Wolff in which he referred to fact-checking as "negotiated truth."
"Well that is just great. Michael Wolfff you may not care to know the facts, but I do. So here they are," MacCallum said. "I wrote my questions on a legal pad, the old fashioned way, on my way to D.C. In a car. No one from the White House or for that matter from fox weighed in on my interview at all, period. This is a news show. We deal in facts. I have been doing this for 25 years and I have never given anyone my questions prior to an interview. That is the story. That is not negotiated truth."
Kavanaugh sat down with his wife for the interview with MacCallum in September. He was challenged to answer questions about multiple allegations of sexual misconduct that he faced and denied that rattled his confirmation process. Kavanaugh would later be confirmed to the Supreme Court in a close Senate vote that fell mainly along party lines.
Wolff, whose last book Fire and Fury faced a bevy of credibility issues, is on a book tour to promote his new work titled “Siege: Trump Under Fire.”
Last week the New York Times published a conversation with Wolff in which he was asked if he asked Fox News for comment on the section in his book in which he wrote the network provided questions ahead of an interview with Kavanaugh.
Wolff said he did not. "It’s a difference between an institutional reporter and a non-institutional reporter. I don’t have to ask the silly questions," he said. Pressed on whether it was silly if it is stated as a matter in his book, Wolff said, "Yes, because can you imagine a circumstance under the sun in which Fox would come clean on that?"
Fox News responded to Wolff's claim by calling it "pure fiction."
The most explosive claim in Wolff's book is that special counsel Robert Mueller’s prosecutors drafted a three-count obstruction of justice indictment against President Trump. Although The Guardian, which obtained an advance copy of the book, said it had seen the documents, Mueller's office flatly denied this was true. “The documents that you’ve described do not exist,” Mueller spokesman Peter Carr said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

Protectionism is self-harming

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The cascading effects of U.S. protectionism on U.S. producers and consumers constitute an ongoing tutorial about what Daniel Patrick Moynihan called "iatrogenic government. In medicine, an iatrogenic ailment is one inadvertently caused by a physician or medicine. Iatrogenic government - except the damage it currently is doing is not inadvertent - was on display last week.
The Trump administration unveiled a plan to disburse $16 billion to farmers as balm for wounds - predictable and predicted - from the retaliation of other nations, especially China, against U.S. exports in response to the administration's tariffs. The $16 billion does not need to be approved by Congress because not much that presidents do nowadays needs to be. The president said the sum will be paid for by the billions of dollars the Treasury takes in from China. The evident sincerity of his frequently reiterated belief that exporters to the United States pay the tariffs that U.S. importers and consumers pay is more alarming than mere meretriciousness would be.
The $16 billion is not the first such tranche ($12 billion was disbursed last year) and the $28 billion probably will not be the government's final restitution, using other people's money, for damages it is doing. So, taxpayers who are paying more for imported goods covered by the administration's tariffs (which are taxes Americans pay) are also paying to compensate some other Americans for injuries inflicted on them in response to the tariffs that are injuring the taxpayers.
President Donald bTrump, who deserves Winston Churchill's description of U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles (a "bull ... who carries his china closet with him), has tweeted that the government could buy $15 billion worth of surplus commodities (for you keeping score at home, that would bring tariff compensation for farmers to $43 billion) from U.S farmers ("@POTUS loves his farmers) and ship the commodities to developing nations. What could possibly go wrong?
In a masterpiece of understatement, Darci Vetter, President Barack Obama's chief agricultural trade negotiator, told Politico that this could have "serious market implications in recipient countries. Implications such as the devastation of local agriculture, the largest industry in many developing nations.
The administration might be pleased that some non-Chinese companies that manufacture in China are moving production elsewhere to avoid U.S. tariffs on goods from China, thereby slowing that nation's economy. What could possibly go wrong? Presumably the administration has thought through the consequences of promoting an economic slowdown in the country that buys many U.S. goods - e.g., China is one of Boeing's biggest customers, and Cadillac sells more cars in China than in America.
Zachary Karabell, an investor writing in The Wall Street Journal, has noted that China is not as vulnerable to U.S. pressure as Japan was in the 1980s, when the U.S. purchased about a third of Japanese exports and supplied about half of its foreign investment and much of its national defense. "China has a $700 billion trade relationship with the U.S., including imports and exports, but it has a $3 trillion trade relationship with the rest of the world.
The New York Times recently reported that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of an administration that purports to be a dike against a rising tide of socialism, is "encouraging [U.S.] firms to reorient their supply chains and source their products elsewhere - meaning, out of China. Capitalists believe that market signals, not political appointees with political agendas, give satisfactory encouragement for reasonable commercial behaviors.
Today's system is capitalism leavened by cronyism and administered by know-it-alls. What could possibly go wrong? A report by a Federal Reserve researcher and two University of Chicago economists has found that tariffs on washing machines raised their cost by $86 on average - but also raised the prices of dryers by $92 as, The New York Times reports, "manufacturers of laundry equipment used the tariffs as an opportunity to raise prices on things that were not, in fact, affected by the tariffs. The tariffs, according to the report, have created about 1,800 American manufacturing jobs, but at a cost of over $817,000 a job.
This is the art of the deal as practiced by him who relishes his self-bestowed sobriquet "Tariff Man, and who explains tariffs this way: "When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. Is that clear? Perhaps not, but this is: Protectionism is yet another example of government being the disease for which it pretends to be the cure.

Texto completo: MIAMI — Brad Parscale, the 43-year-old digital marketing wunderkind described by some as the “genius who won Trump’s campaign,” gets giddy when he explains his strategy to get the president reelected in 2020.
The plan, like the 6-foot, 8-inch fast-talking Kansan, is big. Really big.
At a fundraiser Friday night in Miami, Parscale casually and confidently threw around huge numbers.
The $100 million he spent on Facebook marketing during the 2016? That will be dwarfed by the hundreds of millions he plans to spend as manager of Trump’s 2020 campaign. The army of 700,000 volunteers that joined the campaign in 2016? Parscale expects 1.7 million volunteers this time around.
The crowd of about 120 at the fundraiser sponsored by Miami Young Republicans sat quietly as Parscale laid out his plan to keep Trump in the White House. His comedy-club humor drew a few laughs but the more details Parscale divulged, the more enthralled the crowd became.
“It’s not just me and my computer and a bunch of algorithms that are going to save us,” said Parscale. “It’s all of you that are going to save us.”
That can only be accomplished with relentless data mining — rooting out Trump supporters and persuading
them to turn over their phone numbers, emails and any other digital contact information, Parscale said.
An app that will target super Trump fans
The secret sauce for that task is an app that will target Trump super fans who attend Trump rallies, Parscale said. The soon-to-be released app “gamifies” the experience of waiting in line to get in, Parscale said.
“While they’re sitting out there at 5 a.m. to get in, we’re going to gamify the process of getting in there,” Parscale said. “Hey, you want to get a picture of the president? Get 100 people to download the app and sign in. You want a free hat? Get 20 friends to sign up with their phone number. You want to sit in a better seat today? Get 30 of your friends that are Trump fans to sign in.”
At times, Parscale, who has no background in politics, sounded more like a marketing savant than political genius.
“We can turn every seat into a data mining operation,” said Parscale about the rallies, adding that at the end of the 2016 campaign they had collected 9 million to 10 million direct contacts. “Under this procedure what I’m doing right now, prospecting, we could have more than 60 million.”
“I’m spending more money than has ever been spent in political history to build an app to do that.”
Then there is the new website, PromisesKept.com, that offers a searchable database of “hundreds and hundreds of accomplishments.” By providing your email address and ZIP code, you can “Keep up to date on President Trump’s accomplishments.”
An online fundraising operation that’ll target small-$$ donors
An online fundraising operation targeting small-dollar donors will be launched this summer, Parscale said. WinRed is modeled after ActBlue, a nonprofit that created a web-based fundraising platform, a sort of one-stop shopping that enables donors to contribute to a variety of left-leaning candidates on one website.
Parscale even has a program to open a new front in the president’s relentless war against the “mainstream media.” No longer will The New York Times, Washington Post and CNN be singled out as the enemy. Local television and newspapers also will be targeted, said Parscale.
Until now, the president has led the assault against the media from the top down, said Parscale.
“His voice is big enough to do that,” Parscale added. But it will take “swarms of surrogates” at the local level to fight the local newspapers and television outlets.
“By mobilizing and creating technology we can also help you,” Parscale said. “So, we’re not just fighting on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC with the same 700,000 people who watch every night.”
From small web design biz to head of Trump’s campaign
And then there is Parscale himself, whose meteoric rise from owner of a small web design firm in Texas to head of Trump’s campaign has garnered him enough respect in the tech world to elevate him to a sort of digital celeb.
Unlike Trump’s prior campaign managers — Paul Manafort, Kellyanne Conway, Corey Lewandowski — Parscale’s digital prowess, hip, anti-establishment candor and self-effacing humor could make him a huge asset in targeting young voters who traditionally lean left.
And Parscale does well in front of crowds and on camera. He was profiled on “60 Minutes” and has been making the rounds at small, local fundraising events. He has 274,000 followers on Twitter and posts pictures of his dogs on Instagram, where he has 10,800 followers.
Like his boss, Parscale utilizes “truthful hyperbole” and the ubiquitous pronoun “they” when attacking liberals.
“Do you know what the average wait time is in an emergency room in California? Five hours,” Parscale told the audience in Miami. “You have a heart attack, your loved one gets in trouble in California, take a ticket and wait five hours because there’s maybe 30 illegal aliens getting free health care first.”
According to Parscale, the “Democratic National Committee is bankrupt. They have no money.”
The reason drugs are so expensive is because illegal aliens don’t pay for drugs or health care, “and so they have to charge a large amount of money for drugs to make up for that difference,” Parscale said.
As for abortion, health care and immigration, “they” want to kill babies during the third trimester, “they” want to abolish private medical insurance and they want to open the borders.
“This is just the start of the radical march towards the left,” Parscale told the crowd.

Texto completo: David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, has written a new book called the “The Second Mountain” about the urgent need for more fellowship and community in our country.
We must “renew the lost sense of community that afflicts an America whose churches, neighborhoods, and cultural institutions are all in decline.”
Clearly, David Brooks has never been to Colorado Springs.

I tend to think our churches, neighborhoods and cultural institutions are all in ascent in this town.
And our stubbornness in holding onto some of our Main Street values, even as our city swells in size and desirability, is something I think sets us apart from other cities that find themselves spinning out of control.
Colorado Springs, I’ve noticed after three years back, is a city of lunches.
A few I’ve been to recently include the Armed Forces Luncheon held by the Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC; lunches for CASA, Silver Key, NAMI, Care and Share, the Peak Military Care Network, Urban Peak, the Citizen’s Project, Teen Court, Big Brothers Big Sisters and Inside Out.
The Breakfast of Champions for Peak Vista Community Health Centers featured a gold medal Olympian speaker. There’s an Olympic City luncheon coming in October.
Next week, our sports editor Matt Wiley and his sports staff are hosting a banquet for the very best high school athletes in town. Our stories about our student athletes are among our best-read stories on our website, better read usually than stories about the Nuggets, Avalanche and Rockies even. There may be more than 600,000 people in this town, but we still care about our kids like we’re Brush, Colorado.
“We’re the biggest small town in America,” the mayor once said to me.
Why are those lunches so important? Because they gather us in a tangible act of community, and call on us to contribute.
They bring us together in a common project, engage us in the grassroots work of community building and relationship building. We write our city’s unifying narrative at those lunches.
Cities work best when they are built on conscience, I think, when they are undergirded by a universal willingness of its residents to contribute to the greater good.
I might take that a step further, and argue that capitalism, which is based largely on self-interest and beating all competitors, works best when it is undergirded by conscience as well, when it is guided by morality and a shared set of principles.
“America is great because she is good,” observed Alex Tocqueville in his masterwork, “Democracy in America.”
“And if America ever ceases to be good, she will cease to be great.”
We constantly try to balance two desires in this city, the desire to be left alone, for an absence of restraint, and the desire for a sense of community. What I like about Colorado Springs is that its citizens, though they don’t want anyone telling them what to do, are still very much infused with a sense of obligation to their city, state and each other. There is a strong sense of community and love of place here, something that some cities our size and bigger seem to be losing.
“When a whole society is built around self-preoccupation, its members become separated from one another, divided and alienated. The rot we see in our politics is caused by a rot in our moral and cultural foundations,” pronounces Brooks.
That just ain’t true out here, David. And his prescribed way out of our woes, the second mountain, the mountain of contribution, is alive and well right here.
“The second mountain is egalitarian — planting yourself amid those who need, and walking arm in arm with them.” It’s a mountain of “relation, community, commitment.”
“You surrender to a community or cause, make promises to other people, build a thick jungle of loving attachments, lose yourself in the daily act of serving others and they lose themselves in the daily act of serving you.”
You create a city of lunches, in other words.
I took a ride in an Uber the other day when my car broke down, and my driver worried aloud that Colorado Springs might begin to ruin the very things that make it a great place to live, the way many other cities have, namely San Francisco, Seattle, even Denver to a degree.
San Francisco has always been one of my favorite places on Earth, a shining city of hills, the Paris of the West, artistic and eccentric and staggeringly beautiful.
But friends out there tell me that the tech wealth that has exploded there has turned it into something of an unlivable mess: expensive, divided, elitist, hyper-gentrified with an out-of-control homeless and affordable housing problem.
Salesforce founder and chairman Marc Benioff, a fourth-generation San Franciscan, recently branded his city “a train wreck” in a TV interview.
“This is unregulated capitalism, unbridled capitalism, capitalism run amok. There are no guardrails,” Benioff said.
One writer called San Francisco a catastrophic success.
Cautionary tales like San Francisco’s abound for us here in Colorado Springs. The decimation of local media and the rise of nationalized politics, I would argue, have smashed the moral compass in many cities, preventing them from working toward a common purpose.
But here we still have a strong newspaper, which at its best strives to be the city’s conscience, and we have a community that doesn’t really let national political polarization get in the way of the local task at hand. We still meet face to face and work through our civic woes, gather at those lunches and regularly reweave the fabric of community.
There’s something deeply satisfying about dissolving yourself into a larger whole, dwelling in a place suffused with a love of place. I think that’s what I found lacking when I lived in a big city back East, the soul-sustaining fellowship of people committed to each other and to their beautiful city.
I feel sort of sorry for David Brooks that he hasn’t found such a place for himself yet.
Maybe I’ll invite him to come here for lunch.

Crawdads: Is the best seller really ours?

Texto completo: North Carolina likes to be number one—at everything.
We declare ourselves to be "First in Flight." But it took a couple of Ohio boys to make that happen.
We declare ourselves to be "First in Freedom" based on the May 20, 1775, Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, a controversial claim that many historians dispute.
We also love it when books written by North Carolinians or ones set in our state become No. 1 best sellers on The New York Times list.
So this year we are bragging about "Where the Crawdads Sing," a book set in the fictional eastern North Carolina town of Barkley Cove, and the surrounding marshes, coves, and ocean waters.
This book by Delia Owens has been on the Times' list, usually at No. 1, for 35 weeks.
But there is a problem. We will get to that in a moment, after we consider a few things about the book that explain why it has already sold more than two million copies.
"Crawdads" is literary fiction with strong writing and lovely descriptions of nature's plants and creatures. A compelling murder mystery with an unexpected ending gives readers a superior entertainment experience.
Owens is a fan of "A Sand County Almanac," a book of nature-themed essays by Aldo Leopold. She wanted to write a book with a similar nature focus, but one that also has a strong story line.
"Crawdads" is the result. Its success demonstrates that the combination of good writing, a solid story, and interesting information about serious topics can be a commercial success.
The book's central character, Catherine Clark or "Kya," lives by herself in a shack in the marshes miles away from town. People inBarkley Cove think she is weird, keep their distance, and call her "the Marsh Girl." She spent only one day in school and cannot read or write. However, because she is smart and diligent, she learns about the nature of the marshes.
She meets Tate Walker, a young man from Barkley Cove. He senses her strengths and shares her love of plants and animals. He teaches her to read and write, and falls in love with her.
When Tate leaves Kya behind to study science at UNC-Chapel Hill, she is devastated. But she rebounds to the seductive charms of Chase Andrews, a town football hero and big shot. Their secret affair is interrupted by Chase's marriage to another woman, and Kya is again distraught.
Overcoming these disappointments, Kya leverages her reading, writing, and self-taught artistic talents to record the nature world that surrounds her. When Tate, now a scientist, returns to her life, he persuades her to submit her work for publication. That book is a great success, and she writes and illustrates several more.
All this is background for the story that begins on the first pages of the book. Chase Andrews is found dead at the bottom of an old fire tower. Kya is a suspect and is ultimately charged, arrested, put in prison, and tried for Chase's murder.
The author's deftness in setting up this situation, and resolving it smoothly, has helped make it a best seller. "Crawdads" gained the attention of beloved actress, Reese Witherspoon. Fox 2000 has acquired film rights and plans for Witherspoon to be the producer.
We can hope that the movie will be shot in North Carolina. But here the book's problem jumps up. The geography described in the book, with palmettos and deep marshes adjoining ocean coves, seems to fit South Carolina or Georgia coastal landscapes better than North Carolina's coastlands.
Nevertheless, whatever the moviemakers decide, North Carolinians can bask in the reflected glory of a No. 1 best seller that claims our state for its setting.

Texto completo: NASHVILLE -- Parents, we ask you to hold your applause until the names of all the medal winners have been announced. When the ceremony is over and your child has not left her seat, though nearly every other kid is taking home ribbons and trophies and enough scholarship offers to make a real dent in the national debt, please take a few moments to congratulate the winners as they head off to their well-earned celebrations. Then we ask that you return to your seats. We have a few special achievements left to acknowledge.
To the student who does all the homework in his hardest subject and turns it in promptly, who studies diligently for tests and shows up at every before-school help session, who has never once read an online summary instead of the actual book and who nevertheless manages to earn no grade higher than a C: You have already aced the real tests. School is the only place in the world where you're expected to excel at everything, and all at the same time. In real life, you'll excel at what you do best and let others excel at what they do best. For the rest of your life, you will never again think of this C, but you'll bring your character and your capacity for hard work to all your future endeavors.
To the student with friends scattered hither and yon, across grades and groups and genders: You may feel like an outsider at every insider gathering. You may wonder what it's like to feel deeply enfolded within a group whose very membership confers identity. How easy it would be, you may think, to be told where to go and what to wear and who to stand next to when you get there! In truth, membership in a group always feels provisional; insiders inevitably wonder if they're the next to be cast out. But a gift for friendship that transcends circumstance, for recognizing kinship wherever it blooms? That gift will make the world your home.
To the student who sits in the back of the room with the chemistry textbook propped open and a library book tucked inside: You'll have to learn chemistry, there's no getting around it, but we revel in your love for the written word. In times of trial and worry, of disappointment and despair, a book will be your shield. Immersing yourself in a grand story will be a respite from your troubles, and a lifetime spent lingering over language will give you the right words when you need them yourself. No one writes a better love letter than a lifelong reader.
[The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Visit NYT Parenting for everything you need to raise thriving babies and kids.]
To the bench warmers and the water boys and the equipment managers who follow every play without getting a smudge on their pristine jerseys: We delight in your love for the game, and we salute your loyalty to the team. You may never score the winning goal or hit a walk-off home run or feel the exultation of your teammates as they carry you from the field, but you will know the pleasure of belonging, and you will be spared the sadness of fading glory, too. When you look back on these years, what you'll remember is the pride of wearing that jersey, the privilege of supporting your team.
To the student who fled for the restroom on dissection day and took a zero in biology lab: It's a great gift to love animals. When you can sit quietly in the presence of another creature, when you can earn a fearful animal's trust, you are participating in the eons. Whatever it may seem to almost everyone else, this planet is a great breathing, vulnerable beast, and we are each of us only one of its cells. We celebrate the tender heart that has taught you this truth, so urgent and so easily overlooked.
To the student who bombed the history final because you stayed up all night talking to a friend whose heart is breaking: There is honor in your choice. You can make up the history lessons, but compassion is not a subject we offer in summer school. Today we rejoice for the A you've earned in Empathy, the blue ribbon you've won in Love.
To the daydreamer and the window-gazer, to the one who startles when called on by the teacher or nudged by a classmate, whose report card invariably praises your good mind but laments your lack of focus: We are grateful for your brown study. Here's to the wondering reveries of the dreamers and the dawdlers, for the real aha! moments in life are those that cannot be summoned by will. They arrive by stealth during moments of idleness, creeping in while you're staring out a window or soaking in the bathtub or just wandering aimlessly along.
Summer beckons, a great, green, gorgeous gift. We've already kept you far too long, so let us send you forth with just one last reminder of a truth that somehow you already understand, though school is not the place where you learned it:
Life is not a contest, and the world is not an arena. Just by being here, unique among all others, offering contributions that no one else can give, you have already won the one prize that matters most.
