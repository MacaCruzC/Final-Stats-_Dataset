WASHINGTON — In his urgent demand Monday that President Donald Trump condemn his angry supporters who are threatening workers and officials overseeing the 2020 vote, a Georgia elections official focused on an animated image of a hanging noose that had been sent to a young voting-machine technician.
“It’s just wrong,” the official, Gabriel Sterling, a Republican, said at a news conference. “I can’t begin to explain the level of anger I have over this.”
But the technician in Georgia is not alone. Far from it.
Across the nation, election officials and their staff have been bombarded in recent weeks with emails, telephone calls and letters brimming with menace and threats of violence, the result of their service in a presidential election in which the defeated candidate’s most ardent followers have refused to accept the results.
The noose may be approaching meme status among the recipients of the abuse. Amber McReynolds, head of the National Vote at Home Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes voting by mail, said she had experienced a spike in online threats since Nov. 3, when Trump ratcheted up false claims that fraudulent mail votes had cost him the election. One serial harasser on Twitter, she said, has been especially venomous.
“He sent me a picture of a noose and said ‘You’re a traitor to the American people,’ ” she said. “All because I run a nonprofit that tries to make voting by mail easier and more secure."
“I personally have gotten 10 or 12 of those — emails with the nooses, images of people who have been hung,” said the chief election official of one Western state, who refused to be named for fear of drawing even more threats. “They don’t reference anything you’re doing wrong. They’re just, ‘This election was stolen. We know you had something to do with it. We’re going to come for you.’”
That official, like some others, said the threats had been sent not just to high-ranking officials whose profiles have been raised by news media interviews but to comparatively unknown members of their staffs.
They are the poisonous fallout of an election in which Trump has stoked baseless claims of election fraud on a daily basis, his lawyers have peddled conspiracy theories, and supporters have called for extralegal actions with the goal of keeping Trump in power. The president’s attorney general, William Barr, said Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have overturned the results in an election that Trump lost by a 306-232 margin in the Electoral College and almost 7 million votes.
Officials in some states refused to confirm threats against their election workers, worrying that acknowledging them would only make the problem worse. But published reports of election-related threats and harassment have risen steadily in recent weeks. And in interviews, a number of state and local election officials have said that the volume of intimidating communications from outsiders — some of whom even identify themselves — was unprecedented.
Among the targets, according to interviews and news reports, are officials in battleground states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada and Arizona, as well as election officers in less contested states like Virginia, Vermont and Kentucky.
In Philadelphia, an aide to a Republican city commissioner was bombarded with abuse shortly after the Nov. 3 vote after a Trump supporter, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, singled him out at a broadcast news conference.
In Vermont, a caller left threatening voicemail messages on election officials’ phones Tuesday, including a call for them to face a firing squad. Although the calls were the first to be reported to law enforcement authorities, the secretary of state, Jim Condos, said in a statement, “they are merely the extension of a pattern of vitriolic, often obscene, calls that our staff have had to endure during this election year.”
Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, said last month that she and her family received “utterly abhorrent” death threats after Joe Biden won the state’s electoral votes.
And in Phoenix, Adrian Fontes, who supervises elections across Maricopa County, said he and his staff had been threatened in “plenty of instances” in recent weeks.
“It’s just not right,” said Fontes, a Democrat. “And frankly, it’s un-American.”
Not all the threats came from supporters of the president. In Michigan, the Detroit Free Press reported, the Republican chairwoman of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers was pelted with emails containing photos of dead women and threats against her daughter after she initially refused to certify the results of the election last month.
But Trump and his supporters have unleashed an attack on the election results and procedures with few if any parallels in recent history. Michael Flynn, Trump’s recently pardoned former national security adviser, on Wednesday called on the president to declare martial law and order a new election overseen by the military.
Joseph DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney who is a lawyer for the Trump campaign, was disavowed even by the White House after he said Monday that Christopher Krebs, the federal cybersecurity official who deemed the November election the most secure in history, should be “taken out at dawn and shot.”
The language reflects the increasingly out-of-bounds rhetoric by some supporters of the president. Steve Bannon, the campaign strategist who briefly served as a Trump adviser, said last month that the FBI director, Christopher Wray, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, perhaps the most trusted federal scientist on coronavirus issues, should be beheaded and their heads placed on pikes outside the White House.
Trump fired Krebs, hours after his assurance that the election had been secure. DiGenova later told The Washington Post that his comments were “hyperbole in political discourse.” Krebs suggested on CNN that he would take legal action against DiGenova for the statement.
The Trump campaign has responded to charges that it is fomenting violence with a muted denial. A campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, in response to Sterling’s remarks, said Tuesday that the campaign denounced violence and threats “if that has happened.” The campaign’s primary focus, he said, was on documenting voter fraud.
Trump has only doubled down on his fraud claims since Sterling, a voting systems manager in the office of Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger of Georgia, warned that “someone’s going to get killed” if the incendiary rhetoric surrounding Trump’s accusations did not abate.
On Wednesday, Trump unleashed a 46-minute video full of wild accusations of fraud and tweeted: “Rigged Election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia.”
Excepting a handful of officials like Sterling and Raffensperger, prominent Republicans have said little or nothing about the violent threats that have terrorized election officers across the country. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has declined requests for comment on Sterling’s statement.
David J. Becker, director of the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that seeks to improve election administration, said he knew of election officials and their families in a half-dozen states who had been forced to ask for police protection and even move out of their homes because of violent threats.
“These threats are frightening,” he said. “These threats often go into areas related to race or sex or anti-Semitism. More than once they specifically refer to gun violence.
“These people are public servants,” he added. “Disturbing is not a word that comes close to what they are experiencing right now.”

Two days after it landed on the moon, China’s Chang’e-5 mission is on its way again, blasting off back to space, the beginning of its journey back to Earth ferrying a bounty of soil and rocks for scientists to study.
The top half of the lander launched at 10:10 a.m. Eastern time Thursday, according to the China National Space Administration. Footage posted by Chinese state media showed the flash of the spacecraft’s engine as it headed to orbit, an ascent that took about six minutes.
It was the first time any spacecraft had launched from the lunar surface since the end of the Cold War moon race in 1976 and the first Chinese spacecraft to ever blast off from another world in the solar system.
The lander set down Tuesday in a region of the moon known as Mons Rümker. The spacecraft was in the middle of a basalt lava plain that is about 2 billion years younger than the parts of the moon explored more than four decades ago by NASA’s Apollo astronauts and the Soviet Union’s robotic Luna landers. Images from the spacecraft show a desolate landscape with gentle rolling hills, a sign of its youth.
Within hours of arriving on the moon, Chang’e-5 set about drilling and scooping its lunar samples — perhaps more than 4 pounds.
Scientists are curious how this region remained molten far longer than the rest of the moon. Examination of these rocks in laboratories on Earth will also pin down their exact age, and that will calibrate a method that planetary scientists use to determine the ages of the surfaces of planets, moons and other bodies throughout the solar system.
The spacecraft’s departure is the first step in a complex sequence to return the rocks to Earth.
After it arrived in lunar orbit over the weekend, Chang’e-5 split into two. While the lander headed for the surface, the other half remained in orbit.
The ascent portion of the lander is to rendezvous and dock with the piece that remained in orbit. The rocks and soil will be transferred to a return capsule for a trip back to Earth, parachuting to a landing in Inner Mongolia later this month.
There have been three successful missions to the moon’s surface following the 1970s; all three are Chinese. A Chinese mission is also on its way to Mars, where it will attempt the country’s first landing on another planet next year.
No other country has successfully landed on the moon since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 spacecraft in 1976. Two attempts last year — one by an Israeli nonprofit and one by India’s space agency — ended in failure, with both crashing.
NASA intends to return astronauts to the moon later this decade but has intermediate plans to pay commercial companies to land robotic payloads on the lunar surface, which could begin next year.

Explaining the Frenzy in the Housing Market

Ever since the U.S. housing market has emerged from its pandemic-driven freeze in late spring, there has been a frenzy of homebuying and a sharp rise in prices.
The common explanation is that the pandemic has swollen the ranks of those who need more private space for work and play and safety, typically farther from urban centers.
But why has that translated into fast-rising home prices all around? After all, if buying a new home means leaving behind an old one — an equal contribution to supply and demand — then what’s disturbing the market balance and driving up prices?
A number of factors are at work. Some are well known, and others — like innovations that speed up homebuying — have been less noticed and seem as if they may last.
Mortgage rates are low and continue to fall, increasing buying power and helping to fuel housing price growth. But the rates can explain only so much. The current episode of declining mortgage rates began in late 2018 and has been gradual, whereas the current frenzy began in late spring with a jolt.
There is also a relative dearth of homes for sale. Despite a recent increase in new listings that helps compensate for the big drop in the spring, the flow of new listings is still lower than that of previous years.
In addition, the pandemic has increased second-home buying and has crucially brought more first-time buyers into the market.
Typically, 55% to 70% of U.S. homebuyers are selling one home and buying another, with the remainder buying a home for the first time.
Since the spring, the share of first-time buyers in the housing market has risen sharply. Unlike repeat buyers — who contribute equally to demand and supply — first-time buyers contribute only to demand. The share of first-timers, which hovered around 31% in 2018 and 2019, increased to about 34% during the spring and summer of 2020, according to a National Association of Realtors survey report.
One effect of the pandemic has been to prompt many renters to make the leap into homebuying. To some extent, that’s because the U.S. housing market traditionally associates multifamily housing with rentals, and single-family homes with homeownership (despite recent trends to the contrary), leaving those who want more private space fewer options except buying a home.
That accelerated departure from the rental market of homebuyers has contributed to a softening of rental prices throughout the nation (as has the consolidation of households as renters move in with friends and relatives). The impact on rents is especially marked in urban areas like San Francisco and New York, where the proximity to jobs and amenities like theaters or museums that normally justifies a high price has lost relevance during the pandemic.
But perhaps the most important factor is the sheer rise in volume of buyers. Adding more buyers and sellers can generate frenzy all on its own, even without altering their balance. Homebuyers flock to homes unequally, converging upon the most attractive ones, and in a thicker market that means this subset of homes draws far more buyers than before. (A market grows “thicker” when it has more participants on both sides, while holding their proportion fixed.) The experience of heightened competition around those homes affects perceptions. And when that culminates in higher sales prices, those sales serve as “comparables,” which inform asking prices on subsequent listings (including less attractive ones), lifting housing prices more quickly.
But another explanation for the current buying boom has so far largely escaped attention. Thanks to innovation, the housing market is operating faster than it used to, and that has helped make supply and demand imbalances more extreme.
Here’s how it works. Suppose that for every two sellers in the market, there are three buyers. In other words, the market is a hot one, dominated by sellers. Accelerating the pace at which buyers and sellers successfully pair up and exit the market reduces the number of buyers and sellers equally, and can be thought of as leaving two buyers for every one seller.
Because that ratio of 2 to 1 is even more unbalanced than 3 to 2, it implies more intense competition over homes for sale. (The opposite would be true in a buyers’ market, in which faster matching of buyers and sellers would make buyers scarcer than before.) By helping speed up the homebuying process, innovations also reduce for-sale inventory and shorten the length of time that homes are on the market. (In isolation, it also shortens the time that buyers are in the market.)
Just as technology for remote work has been available for years — but has only now come into wide use because of the pandemic — innovations in home sale transactions have been widely embraced only recently despite being around for a while.
Those include substitutes for in-person visits like 3D home tours, drone footage and virtual staging that lets viewers imagine how a space could be used. The innovations also include mundane but meaningful things like phone-based entry into homes for sale (no appointment necessary), or the availability of remote notary services, which streamline the transaction process.
The key here is that such innovations are likely to make homebuying faster. Showing a home virtually, for example, eliminates the delay imposed by the need for a weekend open house, and a remote online notary can save time when local ones are in short supply. Again, it’s not that these innovations are necessarily new, but that they are now being taken up much more broadly than before.
All of these factors contribute to the buying frenzy, but some are likely to outlast others. The pursuit of private space because of health fears may last a good while, perhaps even for a few years, and a low-interest environment even longer. But neither is likely to be permanent.
If the pursuit of private space is driven by remote work and the need for office space in the home, there is a greater chance it will persist (though not at the shelter-in-place extreme).
But to the extent that innovations accelerating the home sale process are the culprit for a more extreme supply and demand imbalance, well, there’s no turning back the clock on that.

When asked to imagine a British car, most people would picture a buzzy MG or Triumph roadster, or a stately Jaguar or Rolls-Royce sedan. But with SUVs, vans and pickups now accounting for nearly three-quarters of new vehicle sales in the United States, manufacturers in Britain — some familiar, some unexpected — have followed the market.
Aston Martin, the storied sports carmaker, has just begun delivering its first sport utility vehicle, the DBX, to American customers. Bentley, known for rarefied luxury, has just released a highly revised version of its SUV, the Bentayga. And England’s original SUV manufacturer, Land Rover, has reintroduced its rugged Defender nameplate, which had been absent from this market for nearly 25 years.
Not surprisingly, these vehicles have drawn considerable attention in the States. Bentley’s chief executive, Adrian Hallmark, said interest in the Bentayga, as measured in “website visits and configurations and hand-raises for further information was about four times what we saw” at the launch of the Flying Spur sedan in January. He believes that Bentayga sales will match those of “our three other cars, combined” — up to 5,000 or so in a year.
Similarly, Ed Moran, interim president of Aston Martin of the Americas, anticipates that the DBX will most likely double the brand’s global production.
“The vast majority of our customer base already owns an SUV,” Moran said. “And I think we’ve seen, in the high-luxe SUV segment, for our competitors who have an SUV, how much it makes up of their portfolio. We see a correlation with DBX in terms of the role it will play in the Aston brand.”
While Land Rover already produces a half-dozen luxury SUVs, Joe Eberhardt, Jaguar Land Rover North America CEO, expects the United States “to be the biggest market, globally, for Defender,” with sales “around the volumes we see for Range Rover or Range Rover Sport.” Together, those vehicles account for half the brand’s U.S. output.
From behind the wheel, these vehicles fulfill their missions. The Aston, whose base price starts at $176,900, is the sportiest, with a 542-horsepower, twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V-8 engine. Although it weighs nearly 5,000 pounds, on back roads it feels nearly as nimble as the brand’s Vantage or DB11 sports car, though it’s less afraid of a little sand and gravel.
Sadly, the infotainment system — purchased, like the engine, from Mercedes-Benz, which owns a 5% stake in Aston Martin — is generations behind and already outmoded. Fortunately, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, which mirror the functions of your phone on the vehicle’s screen, make up for the infotainment system’s irrelevance, and the DBX’s alluring shape and generous helpings of leather cement its appeal.
While more luxurious and technologically sophisticated — with an advanced infotainment setup, its own 542-horsepower 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8, an alluring cabin layered in burled wood and knurled metal, and a potent all-wheel-drive system — the $177,000 Bentayga can handily tackle dunes and is vaultlike in its highway composure. Its awkward exterior styling melds bland stolidity and tacked-on glitz, but because it tips the scales at a quarter-ton more than the Aston, it’s more of a cashmere steamroller through the twists.
The $51,925 Defender 110 is the intrepid adventurer. Assembled on an all-new platform and sporting either a 296-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four engine or a 395-horsepower turbocharged and electrically supercharged 3.0-liter inline-six, it shares its predecessor’s appetite for mud and rubble but dispatches that truck’s agricultural heritage, providing a luxurious on-road experience.
While each of these vehicles enjoys distinctive positioning and Americans continue to flock to SUVs, some forces are running counter to their success. Heritage brands like Ferrari, Cadillac, Lincoln and even Jeep are also entering the six-figure SUV market. A host of electric vehicle startups like Bollinger, Rivian and Pininfarina have plans to release similarly costly battery-powered SUVs.
These vehicles may steal sales from other offerings in their manufacturers’ limited lineups. And there seems to be an intrinsic disconnect between a high-end marque and the utilitarian nature of an SUV.
“There’s not infinite capacity,” warned Alexander Edwards, president of the automotive research and consulting firm Strategic Vision.
The ultraluxury SUV segment can expect some limited expansion simply because about 30% of these will be vehicles that “aren’t replacing purchases but are just being added to people’s fleets,” Edwards said. But he suggested that an additional 40% of these purchases might be made by people moving out of cars, potentially eating into sales of Aston’s Vantage and DB11 and Bentley’s Continental and Flying Spur.
He also noted that more than 20% of Defender buyers were coming out of other Land Rover products but said, “Cannibalization is very common for early buyers.”
Intriguingly, Edwards suggested that fully 30% of sales would involve consumers “moving up” from a luxury to an ultraluxury SUV.
Edwards provided a clever distinction between luxury SUV buyers and buyers of sports cars from these same brands.
“Anybody who drives the Batmobile, they can be Batman. So when I get into that vehicle, I can become that fantasy image,” he said. “Whereas for the SUV person, the car is my ideal self as the way I see myself, and I’m just presenting that to the world. I may not be Batman, but I am a sophisticated, intelligent person who leads an active, healthy life.”
Moreover, instead of diluting a carmaker’s appeal, these vehicles seem to extend it. Edwards’ research shows that producing an SUV engenders brand gratitude from consumers for understanding their needs.
“It says, ‘We’re not just a little niche group. We’re something that does something,’” he said.
While all of these manufacturers have plans to incorporate mild electric hybridization soon and remain vaguely committed to a more electrified future, they don’t seem in any rush to abandon internal combustion engines. Only Bentley has set a nonbinding deadline to do so — 10 years hence, in 2030.
“We don’t lose any sales to Tesla, as far as I’m aware,” Hallmark said. “Tesla are the big dog in the yard, but you couldn’t call them luxury cars compared to the way that we deliver them. They are high-cost cars because of the high technology. But people don’t buy a Tesla Model X instead of the Bentayga. There’s no cross-shopping.”
So even — or perhaps especially — in these uncertain times, ultraluxury SUVs are drawing the well-heeled buyer.
“A large portion of the population is still working form home, so the ability to get in your vehicle and escape a bit has become that much more valuable,” Moran said. “And I don’t think that’s going to go away anytime soon. The bottled-up feeling that has transpired through this year, people are looking for avenues to escape a bit, and getting in your vehicle is the perfect way to do that.”

LONDON — British and U.S. officials sparred Thursday over how Britain had beaten the United States to authorizing a coronavirus vaccine, a debate touching on politics and regulatory styles that has heated up as wealthy countries vie to receive the first shipments of vaccines.
In Britain, the euphoria of winning the global race to authorizing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was quickly giving way to a more sober realization of the choices facing the country’s National Health Service as it tries to deliver the first doses into people’s arms by Monday.
Nursing home residents, who had been named the government’s top priority, have fallen down the list. Doctors and nurses were expecting to be vaccinated first, but those plans appeared to be in flux. Meanwhile, the government pleaded with people not to call hospitals to ask for a shot.
The question of whether Britain had authorized a vaccine in haste on Wednesday, or the United States was wasting valuable time as the virus was killing about 1,500 Americans a day, has divided scientists and has also drawn in politicians. Facing criticism from U.S. and European regulators, British officials boasted of the decision on Thursday, with one lawmaker suggesting the Europeans were “a bit sniffy” and others misleadingly crediting Brexit.
“We’ve obviously got the best medical regulators,” Gavin Williamson, Britain's education secretary, said in a radio interview, by way of explaining why Britain had become the first Western country to authorize a vaccine. “Much better than the French have, much better than the Belgians have, much better than the Americans have. That doesn’t surprise me at all because we’re a much better country than every single one of them, aren’t we.”
Those remarks drew eye rolls from British scientists, but also provoked more serious concerns that any chest-beating by government ministers risked undermining the public’s faith in a vaccine.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that British regulators had not scrutinized data from clinical trials as carefully as their American counterparts in the Food and Drug Administration.
“We have the gold standard of a regulatory approach with the FDA,” Fauci said in an interview on Fox News. “The U.K. did not do it as carefully, and they got a couple of days ahead.”
Approval could come as early as next week from the FDA, and at the end of the month from European Union regulators.
Pro-Brexit lawmakers in Britain have incorrectly cast Britain’s split with the European Union as the reason it authorized a vaccine first. In fact, Britain remains under the bloc’s regulatory umbrella until Dec. 31 when it comes to drug and vaccine approvals, but was able to move more quickly because of European regulations enabling countries to act independently in public health emergencies.
While as a political matter, Brexit may have made it easier for Britain to authorize the vaccine early, analysts said, the divorce has made the job of its medical regulators more difficult in other ways.
And the flag-waving of pro-Brexit lawmakers was doing little to engender public trust in vaccines, scientists said.
“Vaccine nationalism has no place in COVID or other public health matters of global significance,” said Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a scientific adviser to the British government. “Science has always been the exit strategy from this horrendous pandemic — that science has been global.”
With the first inoculations just a few days away, Britons were parsing the government’s shifting and sometimes vague statements about who would get the vaccine and when.
A government advisory committee had recommended that nursing home residents and workers be first in line for the vaccine, to prevent suffering and deaths among the most vulnerable and to protect the country’s overburdened hospitals as they deal with a second wave of infections. More than a quarter of coronavirus deaths in England and Wales have happened in nursing homes.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said this week that the Pfizer vaccine, owing to its ultracold storage needs, would only be administered in hospitals for the time being, ruling out nursing home residents as the first recipients.
“We’re all sat in this sort of limbo of, ‘Are we getting it? Aren’t we getting it?’” said Adam Purnell, an administrator at Kepplegate, a small nursing home in northwestern England.
“It just breaks my heart the stories I am hearing of not being able to see their loved ones,” he added. “To have another promise crumble underneath them is quite insensitive to those people that live in care homes and their relatives.”
Roughly 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, developed with BioNTech, a German company, were being packaged at the company’s Belgian manufacturing plant this week for shipment to Britain. How and when they will arrive was being kept secret for security reasons, the company said, though the BBC reported Thursday that some of the doses were being transported through the Eurotunnel between France and Britain
Pfizer sought to shut down questions this week about whether people in Britain would be able to pay to cut the line for inoculation, which requires two doses, given a month apart.
“I can say clearly and confidently that there are no plans to supply the private sector for the foreseeable future — no chance at all,” Ben Osborn, Pfizer’s Britain country manager, said Wednesday, adding that for the sake of equity, the public National Health Service would decide whom to vaccinate.
And despite predictions of some analysts that a black market in vaccines was inevitable, Osborn insisted that people trying to sell the shot without authorization would not be able to divert doses from its supply chain.
As for the National Health Service’s plans, hospitals had been sending internal emails in recent days outlining plans for scheduling shots for doctors and nurses. A government advisory committee has suggested that older or more vulnerable health workers, and doctors and nurses who work with fragile patients, would be among the first in line.
The logistics of moving, defrosting and preparing the vaccine were so complicated, the government said, that it would only be given at 50 British hospitals to begin with.
But by Thursday, there were indications that before health workers were vaccinated, the government wanted to offer shots to nursing home workers and people age 80 and over who were already coming to hospitals for other reasons. It still appeared likely that doctors and nurses would be among those receiving vaccines in the coming weeks.
Sally Gilbert, an anesthesia technician who has been working on the coronavirus ward at a hospital in Hull, in northeast England, said she was relieved to hear of a vaccine being authorized.
“I hope this helps us get back to some kind of normality,” she said, “whatever that is.”
Though details were scarce about how vaccinations would work at her hospital, she said she had received an email suggesting that staff members could begin getting shots on Monday.
“I’m sure they have a plan,” she said. “They just haven’t told us yet.”

Sale of Arctic Refuge Oil and Gas Leases Is Set for Early January

The Trump administration said Thursday that it would sell oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska in early January, further accelerating its last-ditch effort to allow drilling there.
The Bureau of Land Management said the sale would take place Jan. 6, following the publication next Monday of a notice of sale in the Federal Register. That notice requires a 30-day comment period before a sale can occur.
The announcement of a sale date came just 16 days after the bureau released a “call for nominations,” which allowed oil companies and others to detail which tracts of land in the refuge were of interest for drilling.
Normally, a call for nominations allows at least 30 days for such responses, followed by weeks of analysis by the bureau to ultimately decide which tracts will be offered. That time frame would have pushed a sale to just a few days before, or beyond, the Jan. 20 inauguration of Joe Biden, who has opposed drilling in the refuge.
The announcement, which came from the bureau’s Alaska offices, did not mention why the timetable had been accelerated. But the Trump administration has made no secret of its desire to sell drilling rights in the refuge before leaving office.
Environmental groups denounced the last-minute push.
“This is a shameful attempt by Donald Trump to give one last handout to the fossil fuel industry on his way out the door, at the expense of our public lands and our climate,” Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said in a statement.
Once the sale is held, the bureau has to review and approve the leases, a process that typically takes months. But holding the sale Jan. 6 potentially gives the bureau opportunity to finalize the leases before Inauguration Day. That would make it more difficult for the Biden administration to undo them.
Environmental groups said they expected Biden to do just that.
“President Biden ran on, and was elected on, the most aggressive pro-climate platform of any successful candidate in history, and he made protecting the Arctic refuge a Day One priority,” Adam Kolton, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said in a statement. “We will need him to use all the tools at his disposal to stop the industrialization of this iconic national treasure."
The plan to sell leases is also the subject of four lawsuits filed by environmental organizations, some Alaska Native groups and, in one case, a coalition of 15 states. The lawsuits contend that the Trump administration took shortcuts in the leasing process and that an environmental review was deeply flawed.
The Arctic refuge is a vast expanse of virtually pristine wilderness, almost untouched by people and home to migrating caribou, polar bears and other wildlife. Of the refuge’s 19 million acres, the lease sales would involve up to 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain of northeast Alaska. The environmental review, which was finalized earlier this year, recommended that almost all of the 1.5 million acres be offered for sale.
The refuge has long been protected by environmentalists and Congressional Democrats. But in 2017, with Republicans holding the White House and both houses of Congress, the plan to sell oil and gas leases in the coastal plain was approved as part of tax legislation.
President Donald Trump has said that opening part of the refuge to oil development was among the most significant of his efforts to expand domestic fossil fuel production.
The coastal plain is believed to overlie one of the last remaining significant petroleum reserves in the United States and could potentially yield billions of barrels of oil. But that assessment is decades old and relies largely on studies that used now-outdated technology to detect petroleum deposits underground.
One exploratory well was drilled in the refuge in the 1980s, and a New York Times investigation found that the results were disappointing.
The American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, has praised the Trump administration’s efforts to open the refuge to drilling, saying it would provide jobs and add to Alaska’s revenue, which has been suffering as oil production on the North Slope has declined over the years. More recently, oil prices have sharply declined during the pandemic. Most of the state’s political leaders support drilling in the refuge as well.
Yet it is not clear how much interest the sale will attract from oil companies. Drilling in the Arctic is costly, making it harder to achieve a good return on investment, especially compared with drilling in places in the Lower 48 states, like Texas, which have less onerous conditions.
Moreover, purchasing the leases would be only the beginning of the process. Most experts say it would be at least a decade or longer before any oil or gas was extracted from the refuge. By then, the drive to reduce worldwide fossil fuel use may mean there is little or no market for the oil.
Companies may also decide that pursuing oil in such a pristine area, one that is prized by environmentalists around the country and by some Alaska Native groups, is not worth the potential effect on their reputations. Many major banks have said they will not lend money to companies for drilling in the refuge.
In the 2017 legislation, the lease sale plan was billed as a means for raising revenue for the federal treasury. The Trump administration originally estimated a $1.8 billion windfall for the government over a decade. The Congressional Budget Office later offered a lower estimate of $1.1 billion.
But independent analyses, including one by The New York Times, found that even that revised amount was likely overly optimistic. Based on similar sales in Alaska over the past several decades, the analyses found potential revenue over the next decade would likely be in the range of tens of millions of dollars.

WASHINGTON — The government has interpreted a high-profile provision of the Patriot Act as empowering FBI national-security investigators to collect logs showing who has visited particular web pages, documents show.
But the government stops short of using that law to collect the keywords that people submit to search engines because it considers such terms to be content that requires a warrant to gather, according to letters produced by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.
The disclosures come at a time when Congress is struggling with new proposals to limit the law, known as Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The debate ran aground in the spring amid erratic messages from President Donald Trump but is expected to resume after President-elect Joe Biden takes the oath of office in January.
Enacted after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Section 215 of the Patriot Act permits the FBI to obtain a secret court order to collect any business records deemed relevant to a national-security inquiry — a very easy standard for investigators to meet. The legal authority for it and two other surveillance-related investigative tools lapsed for new inquiries earlier this year, although the FBI can still use them for preexisting cases.
Section 215 has been at the center of repeated fights over the balance between empowering national-security investigators to detect potential threats and preserving Americans’ privacy and freedom to read what they want or call other people without fear of government observation. In the Bush years, civil rights advocates raised alarms over the possibility that the FBI might use it to monitor people’s library records. In 2013, an uproar erupted over the disclosure that the National Security Agency had been secretly using it to collect bulk logs of all Americans’ phone calls.
Demands to ban using Section 215 for library records gradually faded — it appeared that in practice, the FBI was not using it to monitor what books people had checked out — and Congress ended the use of Section 215 for bulk collection of calling data in 2015. But new tensions have emerged over the extent to which the FBI could use that law to gather logs of people’s web browsing activities, as opposed to using warrants — a tool that requires investigators to first be able to produce evidence that a person probably engaged in wrongdoing.
In May, 59 senators voted to bar the use of Section 215 to collect internet search terms or web browsing activity, but negotiations broke down in the House. During that period, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., one of the sponsors of the proposal ban, wrote to the director of national intelligence seeking clarity about any such use.
Six months later, the Trump administration finally replied — initially, it turned out, in a misleading way.
In a Nov. 6 letter to Wyden, John Ratcliffe, the intelligence director, wrote that Section 215 was not used to gather internet search terms and that none of the 61 orders issued last year under that law by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court involved collection of “web browsing” records.
Wyden’s office provided that letter to The New York Times, arguing that it meant that Wyden’s proposal in May — which he co-sponsored with Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont. — could be enacted into law without any operational costs.
But The Times pressed Ratcliffe’s office and the FBI to clarify whether it was defining “web browsing” activity to encompass logging all visitors to a particular website, in addition to a particular person’s browsing among different sites. The next day, the Justice Department sent a clarification to Ratcliffe’s office, according to a follow-up letter he sent to Wyden on Nov. 25.
In fact, “one of those 61 orders resulted in the production of information that could be characterized as information regarding browsing,” Ratcliffe wrote in the second letter. Specifically, one order had approved collection of logs revealing which computers “in a specified foreign country” had visited “a single, identified U.S. web page.”
Ratcliffe expressed regret that “that this additional information was not included in my earlier letter” to the senator and suggested that his staff might take further “corrective action.”
In a statement, Wyden said the letters raise “all kinds of new questions, including whether, in this particular case, the government has taken steps to avoid collecting Americans’ web browsing information."
“More generally,” Wyden continued, “the DNI has provided no guarantee that the government wouldn’t use the Patriot Act to intentionally collect Americans’ web browsing information in the future, which is why Congress must pass the warrant requirement that has already received support from a bipartisan majority in the Senate.”
Neither Ratcliffe’s office nor the FBI answered The Times’ follow-up questions, such as whether the bureau had used the law to gather website visitor logs or other types of web browsing data before 2019 or in 2020 — and if so, whether such information was collected without attempting to filter out Americans’ data.
The disclosure that the government has used Section 215 to gather logs of visitors to a web page may shed additional light on a fight in May between two factions of House Democrats over the law, before the legislative process collapsed.
The Wyden-Daines amendment had fallen one vote short of the supermajority it needed to be attached to the bill in the Senate. But similarly minded lawmakers in the House then sought to vote on attaching the same language to the bill in their chamber.
The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, instructed two Democrats from California — the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, and a proponent of greater privacy limits on surveillance, Rep. Zoe Lofgren — to negotiate over a narrowed version of the proposal.
Schiff and Lofgren tentatively agreed on language that would bar the use of Section 215 to collect Americans’ web browsing data and search terms. But while privacy advocates initially supported the compromise, they withdrew their backing after Schiff put forward an interpretation suggesting that it would leave the government, while investigating foreign threats, empowered to gather Americans’ data as long as that was not its specific intention.
Debates in Congress over the wording of laws that govern classified surveillance-related techniques and capabilities are often opaque, and the lawmakers participating in the May debate were not explicit about the crux of their disagreement.
But it appeared to fit a dispute over where to draw the line in preventing the government from ever collecting Americans’ web browsing data using Section 215 and preserving its ability to develop investigative leads about foreigners by logging visitors to suspicious websites even if sometimes domestic users’ data may get swept up too. The government cannot know ahead of time whom it will catch in such a net, and there is no foolproof way to screen out U.S. users, computer experts say.
Asked whether Schiff had been trying to preserve that ability for national-security investigators, as Ratcliffe’s letter revealed they have done at least once, a Democratic official on the House Intelligence Committee said his efforts were based on “balancing legitimate privacy interests and the need to maintain capabilities that are critical to national security.”
Even as Schiff’s and Lofgren’s compromise was breaking down, Trump further disrupted the negotiations by abruptly urging Republicans to vote against the bill until the Justice Department’s Russia inquiry was more fully investigated. (The bill also contained changes to national-security wiretapping laws in response to findings that the FBI had botched applications to wiretap a former Trump campaign adviser as part of the inquiry.)
With support bleeding away from both the left and right flanks, Pelosi sent the legislation to a House-Senate conference committee for further negotiations. But without any coherent signal from Trump about what he would avoid his veto, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, appointed no members to the panel — permitting Section 215 to remain lapsed until negotiations resumed under a new president.

HONG KONG — Jimmy Lai, the founder of Hong Kong’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, was denied bail on fraud charges Thursday and ordered jailed until April by a court.
The detention of Lai, 72, came a day after three leading Hong Kong activists were sentenced to prison for participating in a protest last year, the latest blow to the territory’s pro-democracy movement.
The Chinese government imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong at the end of June, and Lai became the law’s most high-profile target in August, when he was arrested along with his two sons and four executives of his media company, Next Digital.
But the new fraud charges are unrelated to the security law. Rather, they accuse Lai of violating the terms of the lease of Next Digital’s headquarters, the public broadcaster RTHK reported.
Two other Next Digital executives were charged with fraud but were granted bail Thursday, RTHK said. Shares of Next Digital were suspended from trading Thursday morning pending an announcement from the company.
Lawyers for Lai will appeal the bail ruling, a process that will take at least eight days, said Mark Simon, an aide to Lai.
Lai and his newspaper have been vocal supporters of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests, and they have been among Beijing’s biggest targets as it has moved to quash dissent in the territory.
In addition to Apple Daily, several other Hong Kong news outlets have come under pressure in recent months. A reporter for RTHK who investigated the police was arrested last month over her use of a database of license plates.
And i-Cable, the biggest pay television operator, said this week that it was laying off more than 100 staff members. That group included about 40 journalists, including its entire investigative team known as News Lancet, according to local news reports.
The protests that roiled Hong Kong have largely quieted this year because of social distancing restrictions, aggressive police tactics and the new security law. More than two dozen people have been arrested under the law. Beijing authorized the removal of four pro-democracy lawmakers last month, which prompted the mass resignation of the pro-democracy camp from the Hong Kong legislature.
Ted Hui, one of the lawmakers who resigned in protest, said Thursday from Denmark that he planned to go into exile. Hui was a frequent presence at the front lines of protests, where he tried to mediate between the police and demonstrators. He faced several criminal charges in Hong Kong over the protests and was one of eight lawmakers arrested last month over a chaotic meeting in May.
“From when the evil national security law took effect until I left the legislature recently, I asked myself at every moment — what can I still do in Hong Kong?” he wrote on Facebook. “I have struggled, hoping to resist in the streets like last year, regardless of criminal liability. I have also tried to stay in a languishing parliament and use what platform I have left to contend with tyranny.”
He wrote that he realized that the only option left open for him was to work from abroad for the cause of Hong Kong’s democracy. Hui said in a statement to reporters that he planned to soon travel to Britain.

Boston Globe names top journalists to be new Spotlight Fellows

Texto completo: The Boston Globe on Thursday announced that it will partner with the Portland Press Herald in Maine for next year's Spotlight Fellowship, joining forces to produce a multipart investigative report that will be published by both media companies' websites and newspapers.
Penelope Overton, who covers the lobster industry, will be the lead reporter for the Press Herald, but the project may involve other journalists from both newsrooms, including photographers, designers, and editors.
The Globe has also selected Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Sarah Ryley of New York to work with the Spotlight Team as a Spotlight Fellow.
“We had an extraordinary group of applicants this year, but these two stood out,” said Scott Allen, the Globe's assistant managing editor for projects and one of the judges who selected the fellows. “Penny brings a wealth of experience and a powerful instinct for finding the real story, while Sarah is one of the most capable young investigative journalists in the country.”
The Spotlight Fellowship, entering its sixth year, is funded by Participant, co-producer of Spotlight, the Academy Award-winning movie about the Globe's famed Spotlight Team. The movie tells the story of the team's best-known investigation, exposing the coverup of the sexual molestation of thousands of children by bishops and cardinals in the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston.
“The work that past Spotlight Fellows have done — and that this year's Fellows will certainly do — has been critically important to holding powerful institutions and individuals to account,” said David Linde, CEO of Participant. “We're so proud to stand alongside these journalists in their mission to right wrongs, and speak truth to power.”
The collaboration with the Press Herald represents a first for the fellowship program, which allows fellows to work with Spotlight reporters and editors on a project of their choice. This time, the Globe will be teaming up with another newsroom, combining resources to produce an ambitious project of great import to the region and compelling interest nationally.
Overton, a Yale University graduate, has been a journalist for more than two decades, the last four years at Maine's largest newspaper where she covers the state's $1.4 billion lobster industry as well as the growing recreational marijuana industry. The New York Times Magazine once described her as a “fresh faced, but dogged investigative reporter.”
“We're thrilled about the opportunity to team up with The Boston Globe,” said Press Herald managing editor Steve Greenlee, who spent 12 years as an editor at the Globe before moving to Portland. “Pairing one of our best reporters with the Globe's top investigative journalists will help us elevate our work to an even higher level. We can't wait to get started.”
Ryley, who will work directly with the Spotlight Team on a second project, won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for her series with the New York Daily News and ProPublica on the New York Police Department's use of the nuisance abatement law to drive people from their homes and business. Her investigation led to sweeping reforms. She has also reported for outlets such as the New York Times Opinion Video and BuzzFeed News, and has been recognized with a total of 23 awards and honors.
“I feel fortunate to have someone as talented as Sarah Ryley joining us this coming year,” said Spotlight Team editor Patty Wen, who was also one of the judges. “She brings superb data-gathering and interviewing skills and seems like such a team player too. She will clearly be such an asset.”
Past Spotlight Fellowships have produced groundbreaking work, including “Secrets in the sky” by Jaimi Dowdell and Kelly Carr, and “The danger in our salad bowls,” by Christine Haughney. The Globe will soon publish a new investigation by Spotlight Fellow Mike Stanton. For more information about the fellowship program, go to www.spotlightfellowship.com.

Amazon in Talks to Buy Podcaster --- Wondery, known for true-crime stories, would help tech giant grow in audio sector

Texto completo: Amazon.com Inc. is in exclusive talks to purchase podcast startup Wondery, according to people familiar with the matter, as the tech giant pushes further into the growing audio sector.
The talks value Wondery at over $300 million, the people said. Wondery's last funding round, in June 2019, valued the company at $100 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Wondery is on track to increase revenue to more than $40 million this year, according one person familiar with the matter, with about 75% of that coming from advertising and the rest from licensing to TV, to subscription services like Audible and Stitcher Premium and to Wondery's own premium subscription service, which launched this summer.
The deal talks are continuing and negotiations could still fall apart, the people said.
Closely held Wondery is the last large, independent podcaster on the market -- and could present the final opportunity for a major tech or media giant to buy its way into the exploding field. Wondery's investors include venture-capital firms such as Waverley Capital, Lerer Hippeau Ventures, Greycroft Partners and Advancit Capital.
Amazon's foray coincides with a growth spurt for the small but rapidly expanding podcasting industry. Once the domain for super-niche fare, true-crime content and pop-culture dissections, the format has exploded in recent years as a destination for high-profile entertainment and political programming.
Podcasting as a whole is attracting over 100 million monthly active listeners, according to Edison Research.
U.S. ad revenue from podcasts, meanwhile, rose an estimated 48% to $708.1 million last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, and is projected to exceed $1 billion by 2021.
Major players in the tech and media sectors have acquired several other podcast startups in recent years. Spotify Technology SA bought Gimlet Media, a maker of narrative podcasts, in 2019 for more than $200 million. New York Times Co. in July said it would acquire Serial Productions, maker of the hit podcast "Serial," in a deal that could be worth as much as $50 million depending on milestones and performance metrics, the Journal reported.
Wondery, which is known for true-crime podcasts such as "Doctor Death," "Dirty John" and "Over My Dead Body," was the sixth most-popular podcast publisher in the U.S. in September, according to audio analytics firm Podtrac, with more than 60 million downloads and streams of its shows.
Publishers ahead of Wondery included NPR, iHeartMedia Inc. and the New York Times.
Like many of its peers, Wondery has benefited from the growth of podcasting among listeners and advertisers. Wondery generates revenue from advertising and licensing fees as well as from optioning the rights to its podcasts to media companies such as AT&T Inc.'s WarnerMedia and Walt Disney Co.
Amazon Music moved into podcasting in September, looking to draw new listeners with 70,000 titles to start, including new original, exclusive shows hosted by DJ Khaled, Becky G, Will Smith and Dan Patrick.
The tech giant has some catching up to do with Apple Inc.'s Apple Podcasts, where most podcast listeners tune in free, and Spotify, which has been investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the format and sparked an arms race for programming and talent.
While Amazon is joining a competitive field, executives have said the service can tack differently from rivals -- as it has with music streaming -- and bring in new podcast listeners, particularly through its voice-activated home speakers.
Amazon has the third-largest music service by subscriptions, behind Spotify and Apple Music, and has drawn an older listening base across the U.S., in part through the help of its Prime subscription service and Echo speakers.

US sets record for deaths and hospitalizations

Texto completo: The United States on Wednesday recorded its single-worst daily death toll since the pandemic began, and on a day when COVID-19 hospitalizations also hit an all-time high, the pace of loss showed no signs of slowing anytime soon.
Not since spring, during the pandemic's first peak, were so many deaths reported. The high point then was 2,752 deaths on April 15. On Wednesday it was at least 2,760.
Hospitalizations from the virus topped 100,000 — more than double the number at the beginning of November. That is a clear indicator of what the days ahead may look like, experts say.
“If you tell me the hospitalizations are up this week, I'll tell you that several weeks down the road, the deaths will be up," said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency medicine physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.
For all the similarities to the spring pandemic peak, there are some profound differences.
In April, the virus and the deaths were concentrated in New York and New England. Today, the pandemic's toll is being felt across the country.
Still more sobering: The April peak represented the worst moment of spring. It was followed by a decline in deaths as lockdowns were imposed and many Americans altered their behavior.
And as staggering as it is, the death toll reported Wednesday appears likely only to worsen, experts say, as the delayed effects of Thanksgiving travel are felt. Many Americans are now weighing how to celebrate Christmas and New Year's.
“This is a much worse situation," said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health. “Summer is not going to bail us out. Things are not shut down."
Still, interpreting daily death tolls can be tricky.
The figure represents what health authorities report on any given day, not when people actually die. So while the total appeared to dip in the days after Thanksgiving, for example, that most likely meant those doing the tallying had time off, not that fewer people were dying.
The April 15 peak included deaths announced that day, as well as probable deaths in New York City that were later reported to have occurred that day.
There are other differences from the spring, some more hopeful.
Though coronavirus cases have exploded recently, with new infections topping one million a week, a far smaller proportion of people who get the virus these days are dying from it. National data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that the share of cases resulting in death dropped from 6.7 percent in April to 1.9 percent in September.
But overall, deaths in the United States are still climbing.
“It's terrible, because it was avoidable," said Dr. Leora Horwitz, an associate professor of population health and medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine. “We are a world outlier in this regard."
The bright spot, Horwitz said, is that health care workers have gotten much better at treating the virus, and that has cut the death rate.

US health officials urge against holiday travel
Health officials on Wednesday urged Americans to stay home over the upcoming holiday season and consider getting tested for coronavirus before and after if they do decide to travel.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the best way to stay safe and protect others is to stay home.
That's the same advice they had over Thanksgiving, but many Americans traveled anyway. With COVID-19 cases and deaths continuing to rise, the CDC added the testing option.
The CDC says even if few became infected while traveling over Thanksgiving, that could still result in hundreds of thousands of new infections.
During a news briefing, the CDC said travelers should consider getting COVID-19 tests one to three days before their trips and again three to five days afterward. They also recommended reducing nonessential activities for a full week after travel or for 10 days if not tested afterward.
Meanwhile, the CDC said that the standard 14-day coronavirus quarantines potentially can be shortened to 10 days or even seven. The revised guidance is an effort to boost compliance with one of the most important tools for limiting spread of the virus.
The move reflects the agency's recognition that the two-week quarantine rule is onerous for many people and that most of the public health benefit from quarantining people exposed to the virus can be gained with a more flexible approach.
The CDC acknowledges that this new guidance involves a trade-off.
The 14-day quarantine recommendation reflects the ability of the virus to incubate for a long period before symptoms appear. But lack of compliance — for example, among people who fear that they will lose a job, or two weeks of income, if they admit to being exposed — can undermine the public health benefit from that standard.
The 14-day quarantine recommendation from the CDC remains in effect, but the revised guidance being given to public health agencies offers two ways for people to shorten the period. If a community has adequate testing resources, the quarantine can end after seven days if a person tests negative for the virus at some point in the final two days of that period.
The quarantine can end after 10 days without a test if a person monitors potential symptoms, such as fever, on a daily basis and has none. The exposed person is expected to continue monitoring symptoms and wearing a mask for the 14 days.
CDC scientists calculated that, for people discontinuing quarantine after seven days, the “residual post-quarantine transmission risk" is about 5 percent, dropping to 1 percent for those who quarantine for 10 days under the new guidance.

CVS will pilot program in home antibody therapy
CVS Health will mount a pilot program administering Eli Lilly's experimental antibody therapy to patients in their homes and long-term care facilities as part of Operation Warp Speed, the pharmacy giant announced Wednesday.
Coram, the specialty pharmacy and infusion care business of CVS Health, will administer a limited supply of the intravenous therapy bamlanivimab starting Dec. 3.
The pilot is operating in Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Tampa, but CVS plans to scale the program to areas of greatest need if supply of the drug increases.
There is no out-of-pocket cost to the patient for treatment through the pilot program, CVS said in a news release.
The Eli Lilly & Co. drug is similar to an experimental treatment President Trump received when he was infected with the coronavirus. It is a laboratory-brewed antibody that imitates the immune system's attack on the virus.

Redfield sees 'most difficult time' in public health history
The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on Wednesday that the nation is facing a devastating winter, predicting that total deaths from COVID-19 could reach “close to 450,000" by February unless a large percentage of Americans follow precautions like mask-wearing.
“The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times," said Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the CDC, in an address to the Chamber of Commerce Foundation. “I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation."
The CDC has been posting aggregate forecast models of the potential for a mounting death toll as the pace of the coronavirus outbreaks in various states has accelerated.
“We're in that range potentially now, starting to see 1,500 to 2,000 to 2,500 deaths a day from this virus," Redfield said. “The mortality concerns are real, and I do think, unfortunately, before we see February, we could be close to 450,000 Americans" dead from the virus.
Redfield added that the death toll could be lessened if the public would embrace mitigation strategies, most importantly wearing masks.
Redfield pointed to a recent CDC report that found that sample counties with mask mandates had a 6 percent decrease in new cases, while those without mandates saw a 100 percent increase in new cases.

Pets, grandparents, medicine, science, sunshine. Check.
Some people were grateful for President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Others for President Trump. Some were grateful for Thanksgiving food; others were grateful for delivery people.
The author Larry Smith popularized the six-word memoir during Thanksgiving one year, a twist on a challenge that somebody may or may not have issued to Ernest Hemingway.
This Thanksgiving, we -- staff members of The Morning, The New York Times's daily newsletter -- invited our readers to do a version of the exercise. We wanted to share the joys and gratitude that managed to poke through a year dominated by suffering.
And you, our readers, delivered.
Together, our team sifted through more than 10,000 submissions -- many funny, some sad, all heartfelt. Then, we found one of the most consequential and life-changing questions anyone can ask.
There it was, neatly packed into six words: "Will you marry me, Taylor Hollenkamp?"
After a flurry of excitement, we reached out to check if it was real -- and if Lauren Few, who submitted the proposal, truly wanted to get engaged in The New York Times. Absolutely, she said.
Ms. Few, 35, had known within weeks of starting their relationship that she had found her person.
"When we were first getting serious, Lauren said: 'I would marry you now, but for everyone else's sake, we should wait at least a year before we get engaged,"' Ms. Hollenkamp, 35, said. "We made it 11 months."
When Ms. Few saw the six-word challenge, she said, she almost felt it was a sign. Her father, Harry Few, who died in 2014, loved Hemingway. Ms. Few said this felt like the perfect way to honor his
memory.
As we waited to learn the outcome of the proposal, subscribers drummed their collective fingers on Twitter.
"WAIT will someone tell me if the proposal in @nytimes briefing was accepted?! Taylor Hollenkamp, what did you say?!" one person wrote. "Who is #TaylorHollenkamp?" another demanded. "Did you say yes? We need to know!!!"
Well before Thanksgiving, Ms. Few had spoken to Ms. Hollenkamp's family members, who gave their blessing. She had cleared the ring with two of Ms. Hollenkamp's closest friends.
Unable to sleep, Ms. Few woke up at 5:30 a.m. on Thanksgiving. She grabbed the engagement ring, a lavender sapphire, and Ms. Hollenkamp's phone, in case an excited friend called with ill-timed congratulations. She crept out of their San Diego home, leaving Ms. Hollenkamp to sleep, blissfully unaware of what was about to happen.
Ms. Few picked up a newspaper at her local coffee shop, buzzing with nerves.
She had originally planned to propose over dinner, but The Morning publishes in, well, the morning. With family across the country -- not to mention the Twitter storm that would soon follow -- she couldn't exactly wait.
After she returned with pumpkin spice lattes, it was time to exchange their six words of gratitude. (Ms. Few had challenged Ms. Hollenkamp to come up with her own, as a setup.)
Still unaware, Ms. Hollenkamp went first. "My life has never been happier," she said.
Then, Ms. Few handed her the newspaper -- the print edition also published the collection --and opened it to the story.
Ms. Hollenkamp said she read it five times because she couldn't believe it was real. "I was like, 'Wait, I'm Taylor Hollenkamp,"' she said.
"I started bawling and then Lauren asked me herself," she added. "She put the ring on my finger. I was sobbing and pretty much scream-cried."
The couple plan to get married in June, then go on a honeymoon in Costa Rica. (They've already booked their tickets.) But first, Ms. Hollenkamp said she planned to propose right back. "Lesbian perks," she said, laughing. "You get two engagements."

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani pushed back against a Tuesday report that he recently asked President Trump to give him a preemptive pardon, claiming he never made the eyebrow-raising request.
The New York Times, citing two anonymous sources, reported Giuliani and Trump talked about the potential pardon last week. The sensitive topic came up in previous conversations between the two men as well, according to the report.
But Giuliani - who's spearheading Trump's baseless legal battle to subvert Joe Biden's election victory - vehemently denied ever talking about pardons with the president.
"Not true at all," he said in a text message.
Robert Costello, Giuliani's attorney and friend, echoed his client's denial, but also suggested that if such a conversation were to ever take place, the public wouldn't find out about it.
"If there would have been such a discussion, it would have been between Giuliani and Trump. Do you think either one of them would be the source for The New York Times? It doesn't make any sense. The whole story is ludicrous," Costello told the Daily News.
Giuliani (above) has not been charged with any crimes, but federal prosecutors in Manhattan are known to be investigating his various business dealings in Ukraine and his role in the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to the European country - a scheme that prompted Trump's impeachment.
The former New York mayor has also been the point person for Trump's reality-defying bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election. As part of that fact-challenged effort, Giuliani has unleashed a torrent of unfounded accusations of voter fraud and even personally accused Biden of unspecified crimes.
Trump's likely to issue several more pardons before leaving office on Jan. 20. Beyond Giuliani, Trump has several other associates who remain in legal jeopardy, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and Steve Bannon, his former chief strategist.

Washington Post does its best to rehab ‘Anonymous’ New York Times author

Texto completo: It is tough out there for a “Never Trump” guy who is nowhere near as interesting as he would like to be.

Miles Taylor, the former Department of Homeland Security staffer who authored an anonymous New York Times op-ed in 2018 claiming he was part of an anti-President Trump resistance inside the White House, has resurfaced this week as the subject of a Washington Post profile. The article, which reads more like a hagiography than a news profile, is a bizarre mishmash of glowing praise for Taylor, advertisements for his political services (he is more or less unemployed at the moment), and various defenses for his rotten behavior throughout the “anonymous” episode.

It also features an awful lot of hand-wringing from Taylor, who says he is scared and uncertain about his future. The story also features Taylor bragging about how proud he is for having opposed the Trump administration while also drawing a paycheck from the Trump administration.

Unsurprisingly, the article makes no mention of the fact that Taylor stood by silently as former National Security Council official Victoria Coates took all the heat for his op-ed, including her eventual demotion and reassignment to the Department of Energy.

Instead, the profile includes passages such as this:
Of course, he went to an elementary school set in a Midwestern cornfield. Of course, the future fast climber at the Department of Homeland Security came to Washington as a teenage page in the House of Representatives. Of course, he landed the most-coveted page assignment: Working for then-Speaker Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican. Of course, he dazzled, and sometimes put off, his new friends and the higher-ups with his energy, all-too-apparent ambition and overachiever’s enthusiasm — for everything. … The future shaper of Washington policy nerded out as a sixth-grader researching the intricacies of policies related to extreme poverty. He got a job writing scripts at a tiny radio station; one day his dad tuned in, and to his surprise, heard his son’s voice. The next thing he knew, Ted Taylor was driving his precocious son to news conferences. ... They’re practical folk, these Taylors. When Taylor went off to study philosophy and international relations at Oxford years later, his father bought him a pair of clippers so he could save money by cutting his own hair. Taylor figures he’s saved $4,000 over seven or so years.
The report then goes on to detail Taylor’s supposedly heroic efforts to thwart the president’s agenda, including an attempt to limit the number of countries affected by a proposed travel ban. Really, though, the article, like Taylor’s stupid book, is mostly just an exercise in self-promotion and butt-covering (“Proximity to Trump’s policies would haunt Taylor,” “Taylor says he delegated most immigration policy work to underlings,” and “he envisioned a dramatic en-masse resignation, including Cabinet secretaries and their top aides, to prove the point that Trump was unfit for office,” etc.).
Oddly enough, the profile is also careful to mention, repeatedly, that Taylor is on the run because he has allegedly received numerous death threats from the Left and the Right since outing himself as the author of the op-ed. Though one would be foolish to doubt this claim, as any political position these days tends to inspire some form of threat online, Taylor’s reported attempts to conceal his identity and whereabouts seem both unnecessary and even self-indulgent.

Consider the following passages:
“I’m so spooked,” Taylor, a former Trump Homeland Security Department official, recalls during an in-person interview that he agreed to participate in only after many assurances that the location be kept secret. ... In the weeks since Taylor’s self-induced unmasking, he has shuffled between at least 10 undisclosed locations, he says, bunking in private homes and hotels after receiving a deluge of death threats. Haters on the political right despise him, nudged along by Trump calling him a “traitor.” Haters on the left demean him for staying more than two years in an administration they consider corrupt and amoral, and for working at a Department of Homeland Security notable for its inhumane immigration policies — positions that he says he did not support and sought to soften. Worried that he’ll be attacked, Taylor now employs private security. One recent afternoon, a large, stern man guarded the entrance to the location where Taylor has holed up for the day. Inside, Taylor stuffs rolls of toilet paper into a backpack because he’s close to running out at one of his other places of refuge. ... When he ventures out of his hiding places, Taylor favors baseball caps pulled low and sunglasses. A mask serves the dual purpose of shielding him from infection by the coronavirus and concealing an identity that has become ever harder to camouflage as he’s upped his public presence by serving as a CNN contributor and talking head.
I write about this stuff for a living. I have seen Taylor’s face all over cable news. But I would not notice him at a supermarket even if he stood right next to me. He has that sort of “generic white guy” quality about him that defines most Washington, D.C., careerists. If I can’t pick him out of a lineup — and I do this for a living — I basically guarantee Joe Public can’t do the same. All of this is to say: These security measures he has taken seem unnecessary — unless, of course, feeling important is the point, which would be consistent for him.

As for the legitimate criticisms of Taylor’s sleazy behavior, including exaggerating his credentials for the op-ed and lying on CNN about whether he is the “anonymous” author, the Washington Post is Johnny-on-the-spot with defenses.

“As a device,” the Washington Post says of Taylor’s decision to go unnamed for his New York Times op-ed, “it was genius.”

“The intrigue about who might have written it — and the speculation that it might have been someone far above Taylor’s rank, perhaps even a member of the Cabinet — gave a then-shocking (though now commonplace) revelation all the sizzle that it would never have received if he’d put his name on it,” the report adds.

Well, yes. That is part of the problem, though, isn’t it? Both Taylor and the New York Times grossly exaggerated his credentials as a “senior” member of the Trump administration. We were lied to, but now, we are being told that it was a pretty “genius” device.

The article continues:
The New York Times took a little heat for calling him a “senior official,” though Taylor was able to mostly swat that away by pointing out that he was, after all, the deputy chief of staff, at the time, for a department with more than 200,000 employees and that the Trump administration had tasked him to give background briefings to the media as a “senior official.” He also got slapped around a little for having denied being Anonymous in an on-air CNN interview, the network where he is now a contributor. It’s not the first time, however, that an “Anonymous” has falsely said he wasn’t Anonymous. Remember the denials from author Joe Klein when he anonymously wrote the buzzy book inspired by Bill and Hillary Clinton, “Primary Colors”?
Is this a paid advertisement or a news profile? It is hard to tell.

Anyway, in case you are still interested, the report concludes with a maudlin anecdote about Taylor crying with relief after President-elect Joe Biden was announced the winner of the 2020 election.

“On the Saturday after the presidential election, Taylor says a friend called him. The friend had news: The networks had declared Biden the winner of the presidency,” the report reads. “Taylor, a man of oceanic words, was speechless. Moments passed before the silence broke.”

It adds, “Miles Taylor was sobbing. They were tears of joy.”

We will leave it at that. There is no criticism I can add that is more insulting than those final lines.

Iran changes its story on killing of top nuclear scientist

Texto completo: Accounts of the killing of a top Iranian nuclear scientist have devolved into finger-pointing and shifting narratives.
Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the man widely described as one of the leading architects of Iran’s secretive military nuclear program, was killed on Friday when his convoy was ambushed on a rural road 40 miles east of Tehran. Initial news reports indicated there was an explosion and a cacophony of gunfire from several assailants.
Iran claims Israel’s elite intelligence agency Mossad was behind the attack, and the New York Times reported that a senior U.S. official also said that Israel was responsible for the operation. Israel has yet to comment on the killing. Early reports from Iranian authorities, corroborated by an eyewitness, detailed an explosion and gun battle between up to a dozen attackers and Fakhrizadeh’s bodyguards.
Attack Aftermath
No one behind the attack has been arrested, and now, officials have begun to spin a new story about what happened on Friday in an apparent attempt to shift the blame from Iran’s massive intelligence failure that allowed the operation to be successful and the supposed gunmen to escape.
Ali Shamkhani, secretary for Iran’s National Security Council, claimed on Monday that there were not actual operatives on the ground during the attack and that the killing was carried out by a remote-control robotic machine gun affixed to a parked Nissan, according to the Associated Press.
“Unfortunately, the operation was a very complicated operation and was carried out by using electronic devices,” Shamkhani told state TV. “No individual was present at the site.”
The account flies in the face of previous versions given on that same day. One eyewitness, who was not named, said on state media that he saw about a half dozen gunmen open fire on the caravan after the Nissan exploded.
“One gunman was sitting on the road, and he started shooting at my direction,” the witness claimed, according to the New York Times. “I immediately put my car in reverse, but he kept shooting.”
Reports sourced from Iran immediately after the attack also indicated that one of Fakhrizadeh’s bodyguards, Hamed Asghari, covered the nuclear scientist’s body with his own, taking the brunt of four bullets. Fakhrizadeh’s widow reportedly described “constant gunshots whizzing over our head from left and right” during the attack.
Shamkhani claimed on Monday that Iranian intelligence was aware that an Israeli attack against Fakhrizadeh was planned. He further stated that intelligence even knew in advance the road where it was going to happen. The National Security Council secretary also placed blame on leading Iranian dissident group Mojahedin-e Khalq, or the MEK, which seeks the overthrow of the regime.
Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman with the MEK in Paris, told the Washington Examiner over the phone on Wednesday that his group was not involved and, in a statement, characterized Shamkhani’s accusations as “rage, rancor, and lies.” He said the regime’s claims that the MEK is involved in assassinations is “nothing new.”
On Tuesday, an Iranian government spokesman said that the Intelligence Ministry had given Fakhrizadeh’s security team “specific and exact details” of a possible assassination attempt weeks in advance. The missive was an apparent jab at the military’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was charged with guarding the scientist.
Fakhrizadeh
Given that the attackers have not been apprehended, and Israel is believed to be behind the slayings, Iran’s mullahs are likely fearful about the lack of control that the country’s military and intelligence has over preventing major incursions of that nature. Fakhrizadeh was under close watch, and the slaying is a black eye for the regime, which is already grappling with overwhelming sanctions and the embarrassment of accidentally shooting down a civilian airliner in the aftermath of the successful U.S. operation to kill top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.
James Phillips, senior research fellow for Middle Eastern affairs at the Heritage Foundation, said in a statement to the Washington Examiner on Wednesday that he believes the narrative shift toward the robotic gun is “designed to mask the Revolutionary Guards latest failure.”
“It would help explain why none of the perpetrators were caught and distract attention from the fact that Israel almost certainly had inside help from Iranians opposed to the regime and evidently has penetrated the regime’s security services,” he said.
The regime has also faced domestic unrest, in particular, in November 2019, when hundreds of protesters were killed in demonstrations that began after fuel-price hikes but morphed into an expression of broader discontent with the ruling Iranian government.
Phillips said the security failure on the part of Iran “further undermines the intimidating image of the regime at a time when it is increasingly hated and opposed by its own people, who repeatedly have staged massive anti-government protests over the last 10 years.”
The CIA declined to comment on this report when contacted by phone. The Washington Examiner reached out to the State Department but did not immediately receive a response.

AOC hits back at Joe Manchin as feud between the two Democrats escalates

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to Sen. Joe Manchin after he said the New York Democrat focuses on tweeting more than “anything else,” amid a feud over defunding the police.
“I find it amusing when politicians try to diminish the seriousness of our policy work, movement organizing & grassroots fundraising to 'she just tweets,' as though 'serious' politics is only done by begging corporate CEOs for money through wax-sealed envelopes delivered by raven,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted Tuesday evening.
Tweet
The response comes after Manchin, who is also a Democrat, told the New York Times this week that he has “never met” Ocasio-Cortez and said she focuses on being “more active on Twitter than anything else.”
“I guess she put the dagger stare on me,” Manchin told the New York Times. “I don’t know the young lady — I really don’t. I never met her. I’m understanding she’s not that active with her bills or in committee. She’s more active on Twitter than anything else.”
The feud between the two Democrats began last month after Manchin tweeted he did not support defunding the police.
“Defund the police? Defund, my butt,” Manchin tweeted. “I’m a proud West Virginia Democrat. We are the party of working men and women. We want to protect Americans' jobs & healthcare. We do not have some crazy socialist agenda, and we do not believe in defunding the police.”
Ocasio-Cortez hit back at the tweet with a photo of herself staring down Manchin at the State of the Union address.
Tweet
The New York representative has been an adamant supporter of defunding the police, and she criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio’s proposal earlier this year of cutting $1 billion from police funds in New York City.
“Defunding police means defunding police,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement at the time. “It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. It does not mean moving school police officers from the NYPD budget to the Department of Education’s budget so the exact same police remain in schools.”

Texto completo: After the attorney general said the Justice Department had not found voter fraud, pro-Trump personalities accused Mr. Barr of being part of a nefarious scheme against the president.
Not long after Attorney General William P. Barr said on Tuesday that the Justice Department had found no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election last month, the pro-Trump media world began circulating a falsehood about him. In this telling, Mr. Barr had been part of a plot by a secret cabal of elites against President Trump all along.
The most prominent right-wing personality who spread the baseless narrative was the Fox Business host Lou Dobbs. In his nightly show monologue on Tuesday, Mr. Dobbs said that Mr. Barr must be "either a liar or a fool or both" and suggested that he was "perhaps compromised." Mr. Dobbs added that Mr. Barr "appeared to join in with the radical Dems and the deep state and the resistance."
Mr. Dobbs's unfounded accusation inspired dozens of Facebook posts and more than 14,000 likes and shares on the social network, as well as hundreds of posts on Twitter, over the past 24 hours, according to a New York Times analysis.
Many of President Trump's most fervent supporters reacted virulently to Mr. Barr's comments on Tuesday because they dealt a blow to Mr. Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the election. The comments were also jarring to some conservatives because Mr. Barr had been a longtime Trump loyalist.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. But one of Mr. Barr's former colleagues denied the attorney general was part of a secret plot against President Trump.
George Terwilliger, who was Mr. Barr's deputy in the 1990s when Mr. Barr was attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration, said Mr. Barr's intent in his Tuesday statement was "just to be responsible." When there are unfounded conspiracy theories about the Justice Department, Mr. Terwilliger said, "it is responsible to say no, that did not happen."
David Rohde, a New Yorker writer and former Times reporter who wrote the book "In Deep: The F.B.I., the C.I.A., and the Truth About America's Deep State," added that Mr. Barr could not be involved with a cabal of elites because "in fact, there is no deep state plot." He said the term "deep state," which is shorthand for the conspiracy theory about Democratic elites secretly exercising political control over the public, has been co-opted and vulgarized by many in the pro-Trump universe.
Mr. Dobbs did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The far right's suspicions of Mr. Barr have been building for several days, partly because of comments made by President Trump. In a Fox News interview on Nov. 29, the president declared that the Justice Department was "missing in action" in investigating allegations of widespread election fraud.
"You would think if you're in the F.B.I. or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at," Mr. Trump said. "Where are they? I've not seen anything."
"They just keep moving along and they go on to the next president," he added.
That set the stage for mistrust in Mr. Barr.
Even before Mr. Barr made his comments on Tuesday about not having found voter fraud, Emerald Robinson of Newsmax, the conservative cable network, tweeted that it was "obvious now that Bill Barr came out of retirement to protect the DOJ/FBI from accountability for its role in Spygate." She was referring to the convoluted and unfounded conspiracy theory involving a Democratic plot to spy on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign.
After Mr. Barr publicly acknowledged the election results, Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, said on Twitter and Facebook that it was "misleading" and that "the DOJ has been very passive."
The Gateway Pundit, the Right Scoop and The Washington Times, which are far right websites, also piled on. In various articles, the sites said: "Barr's masquerade as someone opposed to the criminality of the Deep State" was "a venal lie," and claimed, without evidence, that the "DOJ is reluctant to investigate election fraud."
The articles reached up to 886,000 people on Facebook, according to the analysis by The Times.

China Poised to Be First to Distribute Virus Vaccine in Latin America, U.S. Official Says

WASHINGTON — China, already competing for influence in this hemisphere through a multibillion-dollar network of investment and infrastructure deals, is likely to beat the United States in its own backyard with vaccine diplomacy, according to the military’s top commander for Central and South America.
Adm. Craig S. Faller, who leads the military’s Southern Command, acknowledged on Wednesday that China is actively making “deals to try to get the vaccine deployed and employed” around the globe to stop the coronavirus, as the United States, through the governmentwide Operation Warp Speed program, is “looking at taking care of the U.S. first.”
While neither country has an approved vaccine, China has begun inoculating citizens under what appears to be an emergency use strategy. Its Sinovac Biotech developer has collaborated with Brazil on late-stage trials. Another Chinese developer, CanSino Biologics, has a clinical trial underway in Mexico and signed an advance purchase agreement with the government there to supply 35 million doses of a single-dose immunization.
“Look, we’re in a pandemic and I’ve taken the approach here that any help is legitimate help is welcome help,” Faller said in a video meeting with members of the Defense Writers Group. “So I don’t make any judgment on that. If the vaccine works, folks need to do what they need to do as a nation.”
A major focus of the Southern Command is providing humanitarian assistance, including health care, and foreign disaster relief in the region to strengthen relations and stave off a destabilizing migrant crisis. During this year’s hurricane season, which just ended, U.S. forces took part in rescue operations and provided relief supplies in Central America while American military medics tested troops for the coronavirus as they deployed and returned.
From his headquarters in Doral, Florida, Faller monitors the activities of “external state actors” in the region and seeks to counter their influence in what he calls a global “great power competition” that is “alive and well in the hemisphere.”
Of particular concern, he said, is China’s port deals around the Panama Canal, “a significant global choke point” in the event of “a major global conflict,” as well as Beijing’s efforts to seek deep-water port deals in such places as Mexico and the Bahamas.
China has been steadily expanding its presence in the region with loans across Latin America, Chinese-government-subsidized projects that include a space mission control station in Patagonia and, recently, shipments of medical supplies to help cope with the pandemic.
It has become a major trading partner in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative — but the admiral also asserted on Wednesday that China had been trying to “undermine local elections, pay off mayors” and offer deals that undercut private U.S. industry through unfair competition.
The Southern Command has detected one upside of the pandemic, in the area of narcotics trafficking. The Pentagon has for years participated with the U.S. Coast Guard and other ally nations in efforts to interdict the drug trade.
“There’s less drugs moving,” Faller said. “We have seen an impact of COVID to the amount of narcotics flow and activity as borders shut down and precursor chemicals became more difficult.”
At the same time, he said, the U.S. military and partner nations “stepped up” cooperation in efforts to interdict drugs moving toward the United States.

Trump, in Video From White House, Delivers a 46-Minute Diatribe on the ‘Rigged’ Election

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Wednesday released a 46-minute videotaped speech that denounced a “rigged” election and was filled with lies the day after his own attorney general joined election officials across the country in attesting to his defeat.
Trump recorded what he said “may be the most important speech I’ve ever made” in the Diplomatic Room of the White House and delivered it behind a lectern bearing the presidential seal. He then posted a two-minute version on Twitter, with a link to the full version on his Facebook page.
The president once again refused to concede defeat in his bid for reelection almost a month after Election Day, repeating a long list of false assertions about voter fraud and accusing Democrats of a conspiracy to steal the presidency.
Twitter quickly labeled the post “disputed.” Facebook added a note that President-elect Joe Biden, who received almost 81 million votes and 306 electoral votes, is the projected winner of the election.
The video, which a White House official said was recorded last week, was the in-person embodiment of Trump’s staccato tweets over the past three weeks: one falsehood after another about voting irregularities in swing states, attacks on state officials and signature verifications, and false accusations against Democrats.
The president’s rambling assertions in the video were drastically undercut on Tuesday, when Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press that despite inquiries by the Justice Department and the FBI, “to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.”
The same day, a Republican election official in Georgia blamed him for inciting violence and a wave of death threats.
“Mr. President, you have not condemned these actions or this language,” said Gabriel Sterling, a voting systems manager in Georgia. “Stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence.”
At the end of the video, Trump improbably described himself as the defender of America’s election system, saying he had been told that the single most important accomplishment of his presidency would be protecting the integrity of the voting system.
It was unclear why Trump waited until Wednesday to release the video. But he made it public after a series of rebukes by members of his own party, who have increasingly abandoned him as he refuses to acknowledge the results of the election.
The president’s legal team, led by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has lost dozens of lawsuits in courts across the country while making wild allegations without any proof to back them up.
Some of the president’s key Republican allies on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have urged him to move on in recent days. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R- Kentucky, the majority leader, who has been conspicuously silent about Trump’s claims, finally referred this week to the “new administration” that would be taking over next year, a clear signal to Trump that his time in office was coming to an end.
But he retains the support of a core group of voters who quickly responded to his latest attack on the election. Within a few hours, his tweet had been “liked” by almost 134,000 Twitter users, and his Facebook video had been shared 93,000 times.

12 Votes Separated These House Candidates. Then 55 Ballots Were Found.

After all the votes had been counted in a heated House rematch in Central New York, only 12 votes separated Claudia Tenney, a former Republican congresswoman, from Rep. Anthony Brindisi, a Democrat.
But the razor-thin margin is far from the only reason the race is engulfed in chaos.
There was the case of the missing Post-it notes, which had mysteriously fallen off a stack of disputed ballots, making it unclear whether they had been counted and why they had been challenged. The scandal has been christened “StickyGate” by local media.
Now comes the disclosure that 55 in-person ballots, apparently “mislaid and never counted,” according to a lawyer for the Chenango County Board of Elections, were found by elections workers in that county.
Eleven of the ballots are invalid, officials said, because the voters weren’t registered. Of the remaining 44 ballots, more were cast by Republicans, which should favor Tenney, who holds the 12-vote lead.
The bombshell revelation was but the latest twist in a race — the second closest House contest in the nation — that will ultimately be decided by the courts and could take weeks to resolve if it leads to a recount.
The fate of the race is of utmost importance for House Democrats, who are holding on to a slim majority after a disconcerting election cycle in which 12 Democratic incumbents have suffered defeat.
The other unresolved race is an open seat in Iowa’s 2nd District, where Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a Republican, was recently certified the winner following a recount in which she led the Democrat, Rita Hart, by just six votes. Hart has indicated she intends to challenge the result, which could be the closest congressional race in recent memory.
The election in New York’s 22nd Congressional District has underscored the perils of New York’s opaque and decentralized approach to administering elections, issues exacerbated in a race with razor-thin margins.
Indeed, the judge overseeing the election has increasingly expressed consternation with how election officials in the district's eight counties have mismanaged batches of disputed ballots.
Last week, the judge rebuked the Oneida County Board of Elections when its officials admitted they could not determine whether 39 contested ballots were counted or why they were challenged because the sticky notes that contained that information had been misplaced.
“We have a serious problem on our hands,” Justice Scott DelConte of the New York State Supreme Court said in court following the revelation, according to Syracuse.com.
The conundrum remains unresolved.
The 22nd has been a hard-fought swing district for several years. Running from Lake Ontario to the Pennsylvania border, it encompasses both Utica and Binghamton, in the state’s economically depressed Southern Tier. Those two cities provide ample Democratic votes, while the rural areas between and surrounding them are heavily Republican.
Over the past few weeks, Tenney, an avid supporter of President Donald Trump who received his backing for her candidacy, has seen her lead dwindle from more than 28,400 votes based on ballots cast in person to a mere 100 votes or so, after tens of thousands of absentee ballots finished being counted last month.
That margin shrunk even more as some county boards submitted and modified their tallies throughout the court proceedings, sometimes without proper notice, giving each candidate a narrow lead at one point or another.
Both campaigns agree the outcome of the election now hinges on more than 1,500 absentee and affidavit ballots that the candidates have challenged, some of which have been counted already, although the exact figure remains difficult to pin down. DelConte, a Democrat elected in 2018, is expected to rule on their validity in the coming weeks.
“The margin in this race is incredibly close and continues to change,” said Luke Jackson, a spokesperson for Brindisi’s campaign. “As this process continues to play out, we are hopeful that once the counting process is completed, Anthony will be declared the winner.”
Sean Kennedy, a spokesperson for the Tenney campaign, blamed the series of mishaps on Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who he said had not given local election boards “additional resources to cope with the deluge of mail-in ballots and changing rules.”
“As a result of Cuomo’s bad policies, local election boards struggled to maintain the integrity of our election process,” Kennedy said. “We will keep fighting to see that all legal votes are counted so that voters can trust our system’s fairness and accuracy.”
Richard Azzopardi, a senior adviser to Cuomo, said the governor had made the National Guard available to election boards facing staff shortages to “help ensure an orderly election.”
The next hearing is scheduled for Monday in Oswego County, and the case could drag on if the judge orders local election boards to re-canvass the ballots. The judge could also approve a full manual recount, which isn’t triggered automatically in New York. (A new state law requiring recounts in races where the margin is 0.5% or less goes into effect next year.)
Even so, the judge must contend with the many legal tribulations that have arisen over the past few days and that threaten to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the result.
Under state law, election officials are supposed to mark the reasons the validity of a ballot was disputed directly on its back, in ink. But officials in Oneida County used the sticky notes, many of which got mixed up, and no markings at all were used for more than 130 absentee ballots being contested in Madison County.
Because objections were not properly documented, the Tenney campaign argued in court filings Wednesday that the judge had no jurisdiction to rule on the validity of those ballots and should certify the results as they stand.
The counties’ shifting tallies have also raised concerns about the reliability of their record-keeping, frustrating DelConte, who ordered election officials to preserve and not to alter tallying records and worksheets moving forward.
The proceedings were waylaid again Tuesday when the lawyer for the Chenango County Board of Elections sent a letter to the judge, with few details, about the discovery of the 55 previously unreported affidavit ballots cast in person during early voting.
DelConte has not said how he will deal with the 44 valid ballots of those 55, which election officials say have not been opened or counted.
The race in the 22nd District is just the latest New York race to stretch into extra innings, a result of both the state’s languorous approach to vote-counting and a surge of absentee ballots that swamped a system set up to rely on in-person voting.
The state, which had long lagged behind other states in election reforms before passing a raft of laws in 2019, greatly expanded access to absentee voting earlier this year as a response to the coronavirus, which has killed tens of thousands of New York residents.
The first test of that expansion came during a primary in June that was not encouraging, when hundreds of thousands of voters cast ballots by mail and some races weren’t called until early August.
That delay was explained by both the sheer volume of ballots as well as state law that sets strict procedures for handling of absentees — which usually made up just a fraction of the total vote — including delaying the actual counting until well past Election Day.
In 2018, Brindisi, then serving in the state Assembly, defeated Tenney by a little more than 4,000 votes.
The final result in that race was also delayed as absentee ballots were counted. Tenney, herself a former assemblywoman, had first been elected in 2016, succeeding Richard Hanna, a three-term centrist Republican, who had retired and rejected Trump as his party’s standard-bearer.

In the past, we’ve asked some of our favorite artists to choose the five minutes or so they would play to make their friends fall in love with classical music, the piano, opera, the cello, Mozart, 21st century composers, the violin, Baroque music and sopranos.
Now we want to convince those curious friends to love the stormy, tender music of Beethoven, who was born 250 years ago this month. We hope you find lots here to discover and enjoy.

PIANO SONATA NO. 31
Mitsuko Uchida (Decca)
Forget that famous portrait of Beethoven, scowling with arched eyebrows and Medusa hair. For all its anguish, his music teems with hope. The seemingly inescapable low point of the Piano Sonata No. 31 in A flat (Op. 110), a resigned arioso, gives way to a wondrous fugue. Later, that arioso’s darkness returns — a reminder, even a relapse — but is fought off by majestic chords. Then the fugue resounds anew, marked in the score as “gradually coming back to life.” The melody soars ever higher, riding a crest of euphoric runs. Back to life, indeed. — JOSHUA BARONE, New York Times editor
—
“CORIOLAN” OVERTURE
(Pristine)
Beethoven is at his best when he sweeps you away with him, whether into the heavens or the darkest depths. Nowhere is that polarity more brutally effective than in the “Coriolan” Overture. In the hands of Wilhelm Furtwängler, the most visionary of Beethoven conductors, tearing into his Berlin Philharmonic as the war turned on Germany in June 1943, it’s nine minutes of furious, eruptive, quite terrifying aggression — Beethoven, rampant. — DAVID ALLEN, Times writer
—
STRING QUARTET NO. 13
Guarneri Quartet (Sony Classical)
Especially in our current climate of upheaval and uncertainty, I choose the Cavatina from the late Op. 130 String Quartet. For me, this movement is a truly spiritual experience, a meditation on our existence, a life-affirming reassurance. It begins with an invitation, a welcome, and then we join the musical prayer. But it is not without unease, as Beethoven modulates to an unexpected key and the first violin hesitatingly and tentatively questions. But the composer soothes us with a reprise of the opening prayer, and we find solace in the hope that the good and beauty in humanity will ultimately prevail. — MARIN ALSOP, conductor
—
PIANO CONCERTO NO. 4
Krystian Zimerman, piano; Vienna Philharmonic; Leonard Bernstein, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
Beethoven was one of music’s most passionate and disruptive forces. He simultaneously glorified the traditional forms — symphony, sonata, quartet — and pushed them to the breaking point. One of his most amazing moments comes in the central movement of his Fourth Piano Concerto. The piano line sounds like it’s harking back to Mozart, but restless strings grumble away at something more unsettled. Then the solo piano embarks on a sudden flurry of insistent strangeness, a sound unmistakably atonal in a brief 20-second burst. It’s a flash of Beethoven at his most experimental and daring. — ARMANDO IANNUCCI, writer and director
—
VIOLIN SONATA NO. 7

Isabelle Faust, violin; Alexander Melnikov, piano (Harmonia Mundi)
You could teach a fiction-writing workshop with this movement from the most heroic of the sonatas Beethoven wrote for violin and piano. Set a strong mood from the start (here, dark and brooding). Pace things well (breathless, with one well-placed cryptic pause). Plot your narrative with feints and twists to keep your audience guessing all the way to the end. Create characters that drive the action, like the hunted, haunted curmudgeon of Beethoven’s first theme, and the chirpy martial second theme that skips in out of nowhere and forces a page-turner of a development. Oh, and keep it brief. — CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM, Times writer
—
FIFTH SYMPHONY
Berlin Philharmonic; Herbert von Karajan, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
Even if you think you don’t know the opening of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, you probably do. But you might not be as familiar with the incredible transition into the work’s final movement. This is classical music’s version of moving from Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” to Justin Timberlake’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling.” After 20 minutes of struggle between darkness and light, unabashed joy emerges. I’m hopeful this musical moment is a microcosm of where we are as a people: in the midst of an epic struggle, yet on the cusp of surfacing better than ever and with sunshine in our pockets. — WESTON SPROTT, trombonist and administrator
—
STRING QUARTET NO. 15

Busch Quartet (Warner Classics)

I first heard the A minor String Quartet (Op. 132) when I was about 17. Immediately, the slow movement quietly, intensely, completely took over my attention. Here was something extraordinary. Titled “Holy Song of Thanksgiving of a Convalescent to the Deity, in the Lydian Mode,” it was written after Beethoven recovered from a serious intestinal illness, just two years before his death. The music captures this, though it needs no program note for its emotional force to be clear. The recording by the revered Busch Quartet feels totally in touch with the spirit of this music, scratches and all. — STEVE REICH, composer
—
“MOONLIGHT” PIANO SONATA

Richard Goode (Nonesuch)
Most people know the “Moonlight” Sonata’s moody first movement, but it’s the third that demonstrates how Beethoven became Beethoven . Struggling with his hearing loss, he turns his anger and frustration into a ferocious, heart-stopping declaration of survival. With lightning-quick arpeggios and crashing chords, he teeters on the edge of madness but never topples into the abyss. He would later write that his work saved him from committing suicide. This movement thrills me every time I hear it. — PATRICIA MORRISROE, writer
—
SEPTET
Scharoun Ensemble (Tudor)
I was introduced to Beethoven’s Septet by the International Contemporary Ensemble. This convivial Biedermeier-era work, so influential on Schubert’s 1824 Octet, is one of his most popular pieces, but is so distant in affect from the image of Beethovenian fist-shaking that (as the story goes) when the composer was asked to create a new work in this more agreeable style, he growled, “Mozart wrote that.” — GEORGE LEWIS, composer
—
PIANO CONCERTO NO. 2
Martha Argerich, piano; Mahler Chamber Orchestra; Claudio Abbado, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
The solo part of Beethoven’s Second Piano Concerto ripples with showy passagework that its composer made the most of when he was introducing himself to Viennese audiences. Some consider this early piece vibrant and effective, but not yet the “real” Beethoven. Don’t believe it. Take the Rondo finale. Beneath all the romping jollity, a wild-eyed composer intent on bucking classical niceties comes through, right from the start of the feisty theme. Passages of seemingly playful dialogue between the soloist and orchestra have almost combative intensity. A contrasting section in minor key is spiked with syncopated accented notes in the piano that are almost maniacal. — ANTHONY TOMMASINI, Times chief classical music critic
—
PIANO SONATA NO. 24
Paul Lewis (Harmonia Mundi)
Beethoven is well known for music that conveys a sense of struggle, but there are many more ingredients in his complex musical personality. The first movement of his Op. 78 Piano Sonata is pure radiance and profound lyrical beauty; this was one of the sonatas of which Beethoven declared he was most fond. It couldn’t be further in character from the hell-storming distress of the sonata that preceded it, the much better known “Appassionata.” Opus 78 stands in complete contrast to that, and is one of the most modest, heartfelt, reflective works from a composer more often recognized for his intractable, uncompromising character. — PAUL LEWIS, pianist
—
STRING QUARTET NO. 14
Takacs Quartet (Decca)
The Op. 131 String Quartet is one of my favorite works because it highlights Beethoven’s individuality and willingness to challenge musical precedents. Anyone with the notion that classical music is stuffy or tame needs to listen to this quartet, specifically the last movement. It opens with a ferocity that grows more intense as the music develops. This movement continues with unpredictable drama at each turn. As someone who is in both the classical and popular music spaces, I imagine this movement being sampled and turned into a hip-hop or house track. Beethoven was truly ahead of his time. — EZINMA, violinist
—
PIANO SONATA NO. 32
Glenn Gould (Sony Classical)
The second movement of the Piano Sonata No. 32 is a work of spiritual healing. The tune seems familiar, and you might find yourself humming along, until you realize that you don’t actually know it. At that point, Beethoven leans back and testifies, humbly recounting the physical ailments, heartache and suicidal urges that marked his 51 years. Then comes his spiritual transformation, and that little tune dances like nobody’s watching, transcending the troubles of this world, finding its rightful place among the stars. — TERRANCE McKNIGHT, WQXR host
—
SEVENTH SYMPHONY
Vienna Philharmonic; Carlos Kleiber, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
The second movement of the Seventh Symphony showed signs of staying power early in its public life: At the premiere, audience members clamored for an encore. The movement has continued to inspire — not least filmmakers as different as Jean-Luc Godard (in “Goodbye to Language”) and Sion Sono (“Love Exposure”). No matter how many times motifs from this Allegretto reappear, even within the same movie, the music’s gloomy refinement prevents anything like diminishing returns. — SETH COLTER WALLS, Times writer
—
“DIABELLI” VARIATIONS
Alfred Brendel, piano (Alto)
This is Beethoven’s most thrilling and sophisticated fugue. He’s old and deaf when he writes it, and yet he sets out to create the most ambitious composition he’s ever attempted in fugue form. The result is truly a triumph of the spirit. The harmonies are extraordinary, as is the complexity of the counterpoint. I just love the image of an old artist trying to surpass all his previous achievements. And the ending is sublime; it sounds like a boxer after a long fight. It’s an exhalation more than an ending. — MOISÉS KAUFMAN, playwright
—
“FIDELIO”
Vienna State Opera Chorus; Vienna Philharmonic; Leonard Bernstein, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)
In Beethoven’s only opera, “Fidelio,” a woman disguises herself as a man to infiltrate the prison where her husband is being held on trumped-up political charges. Through unimaginable courage and luck, she succeeds in freeing him, and the crowd joins the couple’s triumph in a stirring celebration of marriage. The text of the immortal “Ode to Joy,” another choral outpouring, also refers to conjugal bonds, but sticks to cosmic generalities. Here in “Fidelio,” though, recognizable characters enact the point: Individual happiness and principles of justice, personal and civic responsibility, feed one another, dual wellsprings of social cohesion. — ZACHARY WOOLFE, Times classical music editor

Why the U.K. Approved a Vaccine First

LONDON — The first rigorously tested coronavirus vaccine was given a green light for use Wednesday in Britain. Doses of the vaccine, made by the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and a small German company, BioNTech, will be injected starting next week, the government said.
In leaping ahead of the United States to allow mass inoculations, Britain added to the pressure on U.S. drug regulators, who were summoned to the White House on Tuesday by President Donald Trump’s chief of staff to explain why they were not ready to do the same.
Why did Britain authorize a vaccine before the U.S.?
The two countries vet vaccines differently.
Rather than accepting the findings of vaccine makers, U.S. regulators painstakingly reanalyze raw data from the trials to validate the results, poring over what regulators have described as thousands of pages of documents. Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said Tuesday that the FDA “is one of the few regulatory agencies in the world that actually looks at the raw data.”
Regulators in Britain and elsewhere in Europe lean more heavily on companies’ own analyses. Instead of sifting through raw trial data and crunching the numbers themselves, regulatory agencies often will study a drugmaker’s reports and, unless there are anomalies, ground their decisions in company-provided documents.
Still, scientists and industry experts said the British regulators maintained high standards, often acting as a bellwether for other countries’ rulings. The regulators themselves said on Wednesday that experts had “unprecedented access” to raw trial data; tested vaccines for quality, batch by batch; and read more than 1,000 pages of documentation.
American and British regulators also have different ways of soliciting outside views.
The FDA consults an independent panel of experts before it decides. In the case of Pfizer’s vaccine, that panel will meet on Dec. 10. British regulators seek opinions from a specialist committee, too, but that group has the flexibility to review data and meet as it needs to, allowing it to move more quickly. In all, the committee met for more than 40 hours about the Pfizer vaccine, its chair said on Wednesday.
Like American regulators, their British counterparts have been reviewing vaccine data as it arrived. And different teams worked in parallel, rather than waiting for other parts of the review to finish.
“If you’re climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare,” Dr. June Raine, the chief executive of Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said on Wednesday. “We started that in June.”
When early results arrived on Nov. 10, she said, “We were at base camp.” And later, she said, “When we got the final analysis, we were ready for that last sprint.”
What about the rest of Europe?
Britain broke from the European Union’s regulatory orbit to approve a vaccine early, owing to emergency powers that the bloc gives countries in the case of a pandemic. Once Britain consummates its split from the European Union on Dec. 31, those powers to approve vaccines on its own will become permanent.
The countries that remain in the European Union are waiting for its regulator, the European Medicines Agency, to authorize a vaccine. Like the FDA, the European regulator has scheduled a meeting during which it will consult outside experts and offer an opinion on the Pfizer vaccine. That will happen Dec. 29.
The agency’s job is complicated by its obligation to solicit the views of all 27 EU countries. That process has been accelerated during the pandemic, but it will still take several days for countries to weigh in after the Dec. 29 meeting, which is likely to delay vaccinations until early January.
When will the first doses arrive in Britain?
Pfizer plans to ship 800,000 doses to Britain in the coming days. Starting Tuesday night, those doses were being prepared for shipping at a factory in Puurs, Belgium, BioNTech said.
The doses will be packaged in boxes of several thousand doses each, with dry ice keeping them at the South Pole-like temperatures they require, before they are put on trucks or planes and taken to Britain. They will arrive in government distribution warehouses by the weekend, Pfizer said Wednesday.
British hospitals have already begun emailing staff members to schedule vaccinations, with a London hospital system indicating that its first doses will be given at 7 a.m. Monday. Britain placed advance orders for 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine but most of those are expected to be administered next year. Each patient needs two, a month apart.
Who will be vaccinated first in Britain?
A government advisory body released its list of vaccine priority groups Wednesday. At the top of the list are nursing home residents and workers, followed by people older than 80 and health care and social workers.
In practice, though, government officials have indicated that frontline hospital workers may be quicker to receive vaccines because of the difficulties of storing and moving the Pfizer vaccine to nursing homes and other sites. It has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) until days before injection.
Pfizer has said that the vaccine can survive for five days in a normal refrigerator. But Britain’s National Health Service still has to consider issues like staffing at non-hospital sites and transport difficulties within the country when deciding how to administer the vaccine.
The National Health Service has roughly 150,000 doctors and more than 330,000 nurses and midwives.
Does authorization in Britain affect other countries’ supply of the vaccine?
The British decision will not in itself bring vaccinations closer anywhere else. But Pfizer executives said Wednesday that they had already heard from other countries that, in light of Britain’s go-ahead, were looking to accelerate their own approval processes.
U.S. regulators, despite months of pressure from Trump, have maintained that they will follow their plan and review Pfizer’s vaccine to the FDA’s standards.
The United States has preordered 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Most of its supply will come from a separate factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Still, many questions remain about how vaccine makers like Pfizer will fulfill the orders of wealthier nations that have procured supplies in advance.
Britain’s ruling offered little relief to poorer countries that could not afford to buy supplies in advance and may struggle to pay for both the vaccines and the exceptional demands of distributing them.

Wong and Chow Are Sentenced to Prison Over Hong Kong Protest

HONG KONG — Joshua Wong, a prominent pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, was sentenced Wednesday to more than a year in prison for his role in a protest last year, the latest blow to the city’s embattled political opposition.
To critics of the government, Wong’s prison sentence is an attempt to muzzle one of the most globally recognized figures of the city’s resistance to Beijing’s encroachment. Wong, 24, rose to prominence nearly a decade ago as a skinny, bespectacled teenager who rallied students to oppose what he saw as the Chinese Communist Party’s indoctrination in schools. His persistent activism has made him a key target in Beijing’s drive to quash dissent in the territory.
Wong was sentenced to 13 1/2 months in prison, while Agnes Chow, a fellow activist, received 10 months. Ivan Lam, a third member of their disbanded political group, Demosisto, was sentenced to seven months. All three had faced up to three years in prison.
Their sentencing points to the wide-ranging nature of Beijing’s increasingly aggressive crackdown on political opposition in Hong Kong, which was roiled by months of anti-government demonstrations last year.
The police have arrested activists, journalists and politicians, while pro-Beijing voices have sought to pressure the city’s largely independent judiciary and freewheeling news media. China also moved to force the ouster of four lawmakers last month, prompting the mass resignation of the pro-democracy camp from the local legislature.
This summer, China imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that grants authorities sweeping powers to limit dissent. More than two dozen people have been arrested under it, including Chow and Jimmy Lai, the founder of the city’s biggest pro-democracy newspaper. Lai and two senior managers in his media group were charged Wednesday with fraud, his newspaper, Apple Daily, reported.
Demosisto disbanded shortly after lawmakers in Beijing approved the security law in late June. The three former members of the group had pleaded guilty to unauthorized assembly charges over a June 2019 demonstration, when thousands of people gathered outside Police Headquarters in the early days of the mass protest movement that engulfed the city. The gathering was a display of both the public’s mounting anger at the police and also the ineffectiveness of the authorities’ attempts to quell the protests with tear gas and pepper spray.
Wong, who had been released from prison only days before the demonstration, was not as involved in organizing the protests as he had been in previous campaigns. But in sentencing Wong, the court pointed to his use of a loudspeaker in leading the crowd in protest chants as evidence of “incitement to knowingly take part in an unauthorized assembly.”
“No riots, only tyranny,” he chanted with the protesters.
Claudia Mo, a former lawmaker in Hong Kong from the pro-democracy camp, called the sentences “very saddening, but not unexpected.”
“All these judicial prosecutions amount to persecution of our young,” she said. “They’re using Joshua Wong as an iconic figure in particular to issue this chilling message.”
The three activists have become symbols of the first generation in Hong Kong to grow up under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party, many of whom increasingly feel alienated from the mainland government. They began campaigning nearly a decade ago, when Wong and Lam, 26, founded a group that led protests against a plan to introduce a national education curriculum in Hong Kong schools, which they attacked as “brainwashing.” They later helped rally huge protests against limits on direct elections in 2014, in what was known as the Umbrella Movement.
Last year, the three activists avoided taking part in the violent clashes between more confrontational demonstrators and the police, and instead used their prominence to explain the movement’s causes, particularly to an international audience. Chow, 23, who has been called the “Mulan” of the Hong Kong democracy movement, enjoys a wide following in Japan thanks to her Japanese-language skills.
After the three activists pleaded guilty to the charges last week, they were immediately jailed. Wong spent three days in solitary confinement because a scan had suggested he might have ingested a foreign object before his detention, according to Fernando Cheung, a former lawmaker who met with Wong on Saturday.
During that period, Wong had difficulty sleeping because his cell lights were left on 24 hours a day and he was subjected to regular medical checks, Cheung said. No foreign object was found, he added.
In a handwritten letter from prison, which a friend photographed and posted on his Twitter and Patreon accounts Tuesday, Wong wrote that solitary confinement had been particularly trying: “Even though I have been imprisoned three times and have the experience, I still found it difficult to be sent suddenly to the ‘prison within a prison.’”
Wong also faces charges over a demonstration in October of last year and his participation in a June 4 memorial for the people killed in China’s 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing.
Wong was sentenced to three months in prison for contempt over the court-ordered dismantling of a protest camp in November 2014. He also served part of a six-month sentence on unlawful assembly charges that was later thrown out.
Chow, who had not previously been imprisoned, said she was not adjusting well to conditions in detention and was unable to sleep at night, according to a message relayed to friends who had visited her in jail and posted to her Facebook account Sunday.
“I understand that I will probably be sentenced to prison on Wednesday, so my morale has been low, and I’ve been very worried,” she was quoted as saying.
Chow was arrested earlier this year on suspicion of violating the new national security law by inciting secession. But she has not been charged in that case.
The activists’ supporters said they worried that the three could face more prison time on additional charges.
“Sentences could pile up,” Nathan Law, a Hong Kong activist who now lives in London, wrote on Twitter. “To be honest, I have no idea when the trio could step out of the prison.”
Cheung said that Wong had found one positive thing about returning to detention: He no longer had to face constant questions about what was next for Hong Kong’s besieged democracy movement.
“He doesn’t have to deal with that for now,” Cheung said. “People understand that he’s incapable of doing much in prison. The burden is now on people on the outside.”

KYOTO, Japan — Naomi Hasegawa’s family sells toasted mochi out of a small, cedar-timbered shop next to a rambling old shrine in Kyoto. The family started the business to provide refreshments to weary travelers coming from across Japan to pray for pandemic relief — in the year 1000.
Now, more than a millennium later, a new disease has devastated the economy in the ancient capital, as its once reliable stream of tourists has evaporated. But Hasegawa is not concerned about her enterprise’s finances.
Like many businesses in Japan, her family’s shop, Ichiwa, takes the long view — albeit longer than most. By putting tradition and stability over profit and growth, Ichiwa has weathered wars, plagues, natural disasters, and the rise and fall of empires. Through it all, its rice flour cakes have remained the same.
Such enterprises may be less dynamic than those in other countries. But their resilience offers lessons for businesses in places like the United States, where the coronavirus has forced tens of thousands into bankruptcy.
“If you look at the economics textbooks, enterprises are supposed to be maximizing profits, scaling up their size, market share and growth rate. But these companies’ operating principles are completely different,” said Kenji Matsuoka, a professor emeritus of business at Ryukoku University in Kyoto.
“Their No. 1 priority is carrying on,” he added. “Each generation is like a runner in a relay race. What’s important is passing the baton.”
Japan is an old-business superpower. The country is home to more than 33,000 with at least 100 years of history — over 40% of the world’s total. Over 3,100 have been running for at least two centuries. Around 140 have existed for more than 500 years. And at least 19 claim to have been continuously operating since the first millennium. The businesses, known as “shinise,” are a source of both pride and fascination. Regional governments promote their products. Business management books explain the secrets of their success. And entire travel guides are devoted to them.
Most of these old businesses are, like Ichiwa, small, family-run enterprises that deal in traditional goods and services. But some are among Japan’s most famous companies, including Nintendo, which got its start making playing cards 131 years ago, and the soy sauce brand Kikkoman, which has been around since 1917.
To survive for a millennium, Hasegawa said, a business cannot just chase profits. It has to have a higher purpose. In the case of Ichiwa, that was a religious calling: serving the shrine’s pilgrims.
Those kinds of core values, known as “kakun,” or family precepts, have guided many companies’ business decisions through the generations. They look after their employees, support the community and strive to make a product that inspires pride.
For Ichiwa, that means doing one thing and doing it well — a very Japanese approach to business.
The company has declined many opportunities to expand, including, most recently, a request from Uber Eats to start online delivery. Mochi remains the only item on the menu, and if you want something to drink, you are politely offered the choice of roasted green tea.
For most of Ichiwa’s history, the women of the Hasegawa family made the sweet snack in more or less the same way. They boiled the rice in the water from a small spring that burbles into the shop’s cellar, pounded it into a paste and then shaped it into balls that they gently toasted on wooden skewers over a small cast-iron hibachi.
The rice’s caramelized skin is brushed with sweet miso paste and served to the shrine’s visitors hot, before the delicate treat cools and turns tough and chewy.
Ichiwa has made a few concessions to modernity. The local health department has forbidden the use of well water. A mochi machine hidden in the kitchen mechanically pounds the rice, saving a few hours of work each morning. And, after centuries of operating on the honor system, it charges a fixed price per plate, a change it instituted sometime after World War II as the business began to pay more attention to its finances.
The Japanese companies that have endured the longest have often been defined by an aversion to risk — shaped in part by past crises — and an accumulation of large cash reserves.
It is a common trait among Japanese enterprises and part of the reason that the country has so far avoided the high bankruptcy rates of the United States during the pandemic. Even when they “make some profits,” said Tomohiro Ota, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, “they do not increase their capital expenditure.”
Large enterprises in particular keep substantial reserves to ensure that they can continue issuing paychecks and meet their other financial obligations in the event of an economic downturn or a crisis. But even smaller businesses tend to have low debt levels and an average of one to two months of operating expenses on hand, Ota said.
When they do need support, financing is cheap and readily available. Interest rates in Japan have been low for decades, and a government stimulus package introduced in response to the pandemic has effectively zeroed them out for most small enterprises.
Small shinise often own their own facilities and rely on members of the family to help keep payroll costs down, allowing them to stockpile cash. When Toshio Goto, a professor at the Japan University of Economics Graduate School who has written several books on the enterprises, conducted a survey this summer of companies that are at least 100 years old, more than a quarter said they had enough funds on hand to operate for two years or longer.
Still, that does not mean they are frozen in time. Many started during the 200-year period, beginning in the 17th century, when Japan largely sealed itself off from the outside world, providing a stable business environment. But over the last century, survival has increasingly meant finding a balance between preserving traditions and adapting to quickly changing market conditions.
For some companies, that has meant updating their core business. NBK, a materials firm that started off making iron kettles in 1560, is now producing high-tech machine parts. Hosoo, a 332-year-old kimono manufacturer in Kyoto, has expanded its textile business into home furnishings and even electronics.
For others, keeping up with the times can be hard, especially those, like Tanaka Iga Butsugu, that are essentially selling tradition itself.
Tanaka Iga has been making Buddhist religious goods in Kyoto since 885. It is famous for what its 72nd-generation president, Masaichi Tanaka, jokingly refers to as the “Mercedes-Benz” of butsudan — household shrines that can sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The pandemic has been “tough,” he said, but the biggest challenges faced by his company, and many others, are Japan’s aging society and changing tastes.
Some companies have closed because the owners could not find a successor. For Tanaka, it is getting harder and harder to replace skilled traditional workers. Business is crimped because fewer people nowadays go to the temples he supplies. And new homes are rarely built with a place to put a butsudan, which normally occupies its own special nook in a traditional Japanese-style room with tatami flooring and sliding paper doors.
When it comes to religious tradition, there is little room for innovation, Tanaka said. Many of his products’ designs are nearly as old as the company. He has considered incorporating 3D printers into his business, but he wonders who’s going to buy items made with one.
Ichiwa is blissfully untroubled by such concerns. The family is large, the business is small, and the only special skill needed to grill the mochi is a high tolerance for blistering heat.
But Hasegawa, 60, admits she sometimes feels the pressure of the shop’s history. Even though the business doesn’t provide much of a living, everyone in the family from a young age “was warned that as long as one of us was still alive, we needed to carry on,” she said.
One reason “we keep going,” she added, is “because we all hate the idea of being the one to let it go.”

Is China Laying Claim to Kimchi, Too? Some South Koreans Think So

SEOUL, South Korea — Fermented vegetables are delicious — on this point, many people from China and South Korea can agree. But for some social media users in the two countries, the culinary goodwill ends there.
A spat is raging this week over a Chinese state tabloid’s claim that China had “led” the development of an international standard for paocai, or pickled vegetables. In South Korea, the claim was seen as misleading because in the Chinese language, paocai also refers to kimchi — the fermented cabbage dish that plays an integral role in Korean cuisine.
It wasn’t clear whether the ambiguity was unintentional or an example of the trolling for which the tabloid, Global Times, is famous. But it prompted ripostes from South Korean officials and newspapers, along with a slew of barbed social media comments about the finer points of pickled cabbage.
“If China plagiarizes the fermentation process of kimchi in the future, then South Korea’s traditional culture may disappear,” one anxious user wrote on Naver, a popular social media platform in South Korea.
The spat opens another front in a tussle for soft power between two countries whose relations sometimes sour over weightier matters, like Kim Jong Un’s nuclear program and the Korean War’s legacy.
It also touches on cultural sore points in South Korea: Nearly 40% of the factory-made kimchi consumed there is imported from China, and the tradition of making the dish locally is fading as Korean families eat more non-Korean cuisine.
The kimchi spat began last week, when a global regulator based in Switzerland released a draft definition of the “categories” and “requirements” of paocai. That is the name in Mandarin for a kimchi-like dish of fermented vegetables that is popular in the western Chinese province of Sichuan.
The regulator, the International Organization for Standardization, typically issues such guidelines to ensure that products and services in one country can be used in the industrial processes of another. In this case, it said that a lack of “unified and explicit product quality and safety guarantees” in the paocai industry “greatly limits the international trade and circulation of paocai products.”
The ISO said specifically that its definition “does not apply to kimchi.” But in an article over the weekend, Global Times, which is fiercely nationalistic, said the new standard proved that China had set an “industry benchmark” for “the international paocai market” — a term that essentially includes kimchi.
The tabloid’s needling, if that’s what it was, touched a nerve in South Korea, where many people feel threatened by China’s increasingly assertive presence in the region. Some social media users accused Global Times of cultural appropriation.
With South Korean “cultural content expanding its influence on a global scale, it seems that China is making efforts to claim that such content was traced to them,” Seo Kyoung-duk, a professor at Sungshin Women’s University in Seoul, told the Yonhap news agency, echoing a chorus of online commentary.
South Korea’s Agriculture Ministry said in a statement Sunday that the ISO’s paocai standard was “completely not related to our kimchi,” adding that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization had published a definition of kimchi in 2001.
“It is inappropriate to report without differentiating our kimchi from paocai,” the ministry said.
Sandrine Tranchard, a spokeswoman for the ISO, said in an email that the organization typically develops standards based on requests from “industry or other stakeholders,” and that its technical committees include experts from industry, consumer groups, academia, governments and nonprofits.
“We cannot comment on the food or cultural heritage,” she said of the paocai standard.
The spat is hardly the first in Asia over a perceived attempt to lay claim, directly or otherwise, to another country’s tradition.
In 2018, for example, when Singapore announced a plan to ask UNESCO to recognize its street-food vendors as an “intangible heritage,” critics in neighboring Malaysia essentially said that their vendors were better — and that much of Singapore’s cuisine came from Malaysia in the first place. Indonesia had a similar quarrel with Malaysia over batik, the textile-dyeing process.
South and North Korea also campaigned separately to put the kimchi-making season, a centuries-old tradition known as “kimjang,” on UNESCO’s intangible heritage register. The agency agreed to both Koreas’ requests.
Kimchi belongs to an international family of pickled food that includes paocai, tsukemono (from Japan) and sauerkraut (from Germany), said Cho Jung-eun, a director at the World Institute of Kimchi, a research institute financed by the South Korean government.
Cho said that when the FAO published its kimchi definition in 2001, “China was not interested in kimchi at all, and kimchi was not produced in China at that time.” It was only after about 2003 that South Koreans began moving to China to build kimchi factories, she added, and later still that a local market for the dish developed within China.
Cho said that kimchi is different from its pickled cousins because of its distinctive blend of garlic, ginger and red pepper powder.
The FAO’s 2001 definition says that kimchi consists of “Chinese cabbage” and other vegetables that are “trimmed, cut, salted and seasoned before fermentation.” A country’s decision to formally accept such definitions is voluntary, and the FAO does not adjudicate disputes about how to interpret them. The agency declined to comment Tuesday.
Some Chinese users have been striking a conciliatory note, saying on social media that kimchi and “Sichuan kimchi” are both delicious — or even that “our paocai” is not as tasty as its Korean counterpart.
But others are not letting go.
“Sichuan’s is the real kimchi,” a user wrote Monday on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media platform in China. “South Korea’s version is merely pickles.”

Add Parkour to the Olympics? Purists Say ‘Nah’

Parkour, the video-friendly sport in which daredevils race over rooftops, flip over ledges and climb walls without assistance or equipment, has always felt a little different. Its freewheeling ethos makes it stand out from other sports, and that perception is encouraged by its fans, athletes and organizers.
But as the sport’s popularity has increased since its emergence in the late 1980s, it has become more organized. And with the lure of a major leap in legitimacy on the horizon, the sport has been drawn into an intramural feud over who governs the acts of spinning, twirling athletes spectacularly catapulting themselves through an urban landscape.
The feud has reached the point that one side — parkour’s international federation — said Tuesday that it did not want what is considered the holy grail of recognition for just about every other lesser-known sport: inclusion in the Olympics.
Parkour began to catch mainstream popularity in the 1990s and 2000s, as the video-readiness of the eye-catching sport helped it become a television and YouTube staple, and later, a social media sensation.
Early parkour practitioners emphasized philosophies like freedom and expressiveness almost as much as the physicality of the sport, which derives from military training and combines elements of gymnastics, martial arts and climbing. Competitiveness and rivalry were shunned as being against the nature of parkour.
Despite that, a parkour federation was founded in 2007 not just to expand the sport but also to add competitive events. In 2017, the international gymnastics federation, FIG, seeing a way to tap into a younger audience, began holding parkour events as well, saying the sport was a natural extension of its own.
That put the two federations at loggerheads as both organized competing events.
“They are a gymnastics federation, not a parkour federation,” said Damien Puddle, the chief executive of Parkour Earth, the sport’s federation. “Parkour is a distinct activity. The whole thing is seemingly a farce.”
The gymnastics federation did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
There are the two main events of competitive parkour, which would be candidates for the Games someday. In speed run, athletes race over a course without pausing for tricks or specialty moves, with only their time counting toward their victory. In freestyle, the athletes are judged subjectively on difficulty and execution.
The International Olympic Committee is meeting Monday to finalize the program for the 2024 Olympics in Paris. No new sports are expected to be added, beyond a few that were already chosen, like break dancing. But individual federations already in the Games may seek to add events to their lineups. That gives the gymnastics federation a chance to ask to include parkour events, leaving out the parkour federation.
“Parkour has been recognized as a sovereign, distinct and independent sport in its own right, and as such cannot be considered a discipline of, or subsidiary to, gymnastics or any other sport,” the parkour federation, Parkour Earth, said in a letter to the IOC on Tuesday. “FIG’s encroachment and misappropriation of our sport continues.”
The federation’s letter to the Olympic committee is rife with phrases like “due diligence,” “formally petition” and “recognized international norms,” the legalese seeming to stand in contrast to the anything-goes spirit of men and women jumping from roof to roof.
Their dispute was reminiscent of a conflict over stand-up paddleboarding in 2017. Each of the canoeing and surfing federations said they were the rightful steward of the sport going forward. Eventually, surfing won.
The Tokyo Games, now scheduled for 2021, are planning to add five sports, although they have been approved for that Games only: baseball and softball (which the IOC counts together), karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding.
The IOC is expected to approve sport climbing, surfing, skateboarding, plus break dancing for Paris 2024.
Regardless of which federation wins the battle, there are parkour enthusiasts out there who have always failed to see the appeal of the Olympics and believe the ultracompetitiveness of the Games conflicts with the spirit of parkour. It is an internal conflict that has also surfaced in other sports with unconventional ethos, like snowboarding and skateboarding.
Puddle, of the parkour federation, would not commit to his sport in the Games, even under his own group’s control.
“That’s a conversation that our community hasn’t had yet,” he said. “The community at large, even if they do participate in competition, that’s not their focus. Most people do it for the love of the experience.”
Ryan Doyle, an English legend of the sport, said in 2010: “Sometimes, people ask, ‘Who is the best at parkour?’ and it's because they don’t understand what parkour is. ‘Who is the best?’ is what you’d say to a sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art form, it’s a discipline. That’s like saying, ‘What’s the best song in the world?’”

Texto completo: When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge - and I don't mean the pandemic, although COVID-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he'll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.
It goes without saying that Trump, whose conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder, will never concede, and that millions of his followers will always believe - or at least say they believe - that the election was stolen.
Most Republicans in Congress certainly know this is a lie, although even on Capitol Hill there are a lot more crazy than we'd like to imagine. But it doesn't matter; they still won't accept that Biden has any legitimacy, even though he won the popular vote by a large margin.
And this won't simply be because they fear a backlash from the base if they admit that Trump lost fair and square. At a fundamental level - and completely separate from the Trump factor - today's GOP doesn't believe that Democrats ever have the right to govern, no matter how many votes they receive.
After all, in recent years we've seen what happens when a state with a Republican legislature elects a Democratic governor: Legislators quickly try to strip away the governor's powers. So does anyone doubt that Republicans will do all they can to hobble and sabotage Biden's presidency?
The only real questions are how much harm the GOP can do and how Biden will respond.
The answer to the first question depends a lot on what happens in the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs. If Democrats win both seats, they'll have effective though narrow control of both houses of Congress. If they don't, Mitch McConnell will have enormous powers of obstruction - and anyone who doubts that he'll use those powers to undermine Biden at every turn is living in a fantasy world.
But how much damage would obstructionism inflict? In terms of economic policy - which is all I'll talk about in this column - the near future can be divided into two eras, pre- and post-vaccine (or more accurately, after wide dissemination of a vaccine).
For the next few months, as the pandemic continues to run wild, tens of millions of Americans will be in desperate straits unless the federal government steps up to help. Unfortunately, Republicans may be in a position to block this help.
The good news about the very near future, such as it is, is that Americans will probably (and correctly) blame Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, for the misery they're experiencing - and this very fact may make Republicans willing to cough up at least some money.
What about the post-vaccine economy? Here again there's potentially some good news: Once a vaccine becomes widely available, we'll probably see a spontaneous economic recovery, one that won't depend on Republican cooperation. And there will also be a vast national sense of relief.
So Biden might do OK for a while even in the face of scorched-earth Republican opposition. But we can't be sure of that. Republicans might refuse to confirm anyone for key economic positions. There's always the possibility of another financial crisis - and outgoing Trump officials have been systematically undermining the incoming administration's ability to deal with such a crisis if it happens. And America desperately needs action on issues from infrastructure to climate change to tax enforcement that won't happen if Republicans retain blocking power.
So what can Biden do?
First, he needs to start talking about immediate policy actions to help ordinary Americans, if only to make it clear to Georgia voters how much damage will be done if they don't elect Democrats to those two Senate seats.
If Democrats don't get those seats, Biden will need to use executive action to accomplish as much as possible despite Republican obstruction - although I worry that the Trump-stacked Supreme Court will try to block him when he does.
Finally, although Biden is still talking in a comforting way about unity and reaching across the aisle, at some point he'll need to stop reassuring us that he's nothing like Trump and start making Republicans pay a political price for their attempts to prevent him from governing.
Now, I don't mean that he should sound like Trump, demanding retribution against his enemies - although the Justice Department should be allowed to do its job and prosecute whatever Trump-era crimes it finds.
No, what Biden needs to do is what Harry Truman did in 1948, when he built political support by running against "do-nothing" Republicans. And he'll have a better case than Truman ever did, because today's Republicans are infinitely more corrupt and less patriotic than the Republicans Truman faced.
The results of this year's election, with a solid Biden win but Republicans doing well down ballot, tells us that American voters don't fully understand what the modern GOP is really about. Biden needs to get that point across and make Republicans pay for the sabotage we all know is coming.

Virus possibly present in US in mid-December

Texto completo: The coronavirus may have infected people in the United States as early as Dec. 13, more than a month earlier than researchers had thought, according to scientists who analyzed blood samples taken from American Red Cross donations. Outside scientists cautioned, however, that the virus was probably not spreading that early.
The researchers noted that they cannot say whether the apparent infections were in travelers who had been infected in other countries, or whether the infections themselves were dead ends, and did not lead to community transmission.
Before this new report, the earliest documented infection in the country was on Jan. 19 in someone who had traveled to China. Although other genetic studies have suggested the possible presence of the virus earlier than Jan. 19, the new study found that blood donations from nine states sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention carried coronavirus antibodies — protein markers of past exposure to the virus.
But at least one prominent virus researcher cautioned that these results could be interpreted differently. Trevor Bedford, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who has been deeply involved in genetic studies of how, when, and where the virus has spread, said in a series of tweets that he thought the study could be identifying people who had antibodies to other human coronaviruses, which cause common colds, although he did not rule out that it may have picked up some cases of travelers who had been infected in other countries.
In the new report, which was released online Monday and has been accepted for publication in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, Dr. Sridhar V. Basavaraju of the CDC and others reported that they had looked for antibodies that reacted to the specific virus that has caused the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2.
In more than 7,000 samples, 106 showed antibodies, they found. The researchers did not find these tests definitive, however, because they can sometimes reveal antibodies to other coronaviruses.
After further tests, they found one blood sample to be most convincing because it showed antibodies to a specific part of the SARS-CoV-2 protein. It was collected on Jan. 10 in Connecticut and was “likely from an individual with a past or active SARS-CoV-2 infection." That person could have been infected while traveling.

LA reverses decision to close testing site for a film shoot
The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, said early Tuesday that the city would reopen a coronavirus testing site at Union Station, a major transit hub, after residents criticized a decision to temporarily close the site during a film shoot.
The movie, “He's All That," which features the TikTok star Addison Rae and is a reboot of the 1999 romantic comedy “She's All That," had received approval to film inside and outside the station on Tuesday, the city and county's film office said. About 170 cast and crew members were expected to take part in the movie scenes, the film office said.
The reversal came after a homeless outreach and advocacy group called Ktown for All criticized the decision to close the site and shared a copy of an e-mail that it said a resident received on Monday afternoon from the company that operates the testing site.
It said that all testing appointments for Tuesday at the station had been canceled because of an event there.
The group said that the move showed that the city had misplaced its priorities at a time when hospitalizations for the virus are on the rise, and that the decision to close the site for a day made it more difficult for people who rely on public transportation to get tested.
“It's truly one of the only COVID testing centers within the city of Los Angeles that is really accessible by public transit," Devon Manney, a spokesman for the group, said in an interview on Monday night. “This is the LA that we are constantly fighting against."
Philip Sokoloski, a spokesman for the film office, which is known as FilmLA, said on Monday night that neither the office nor the locations team for the production company had been aware that the station was one of the city's virus testing locations and were not involved in the decision to close the site.
Union Station is one of the city's 10 permanent testing sites and five pop-up locations, including one at the North Hollywood Metro station that is on the same rapid transit line as Union Station. City officials did not say who had made the decision to suspend testing at Union Station.
In a tweet, Garcetti said the 504 people who were scheduled for a test at Union Station on Tuesday could visit the site as planned. City officials said about 350 daily tests are conducted on average at Union Station, which they said accounted for less than 1 percent of the more than 35,000 tests that are done every day in Los Angeles.
Miramax, which is releasing the film, declined to comment on Monday night.

N.J. health officials urge safe holiday celebrations
It's beginning to look a lot like . . . well, a different kind of holiday season.
With the holidays fast approaching, New Jersey health officials are urging people to celebrate safely, even if it means altering favorite traditions.
Edward Lifshitz, medical director of the state's Department of Health and Senior Services, on Tuesday previewed the department's guidelines for a safer pandemic holiday. On the naughty list: holiday parties, parades, and sitting on Santa's lap.
“We know that this is a time of year where you're used to gathering with loved ones and friends to celebrate," Lifshitz said at a news conference. “But this year, we need to change how we enjoy the holidays."
The guidelines discourage indoor visits with Santa and encourage people to consider alternatives such as meeting Santa digitally and participating in live-streamed holiday parades.
Malls and other indoor locations that choose to offer indoor Santa sessions anyway must require reservations, time limits, and social distancing.
The guidelines also stipulate that Santa, staff, groups of singers, and every person over 2 be masked.
Christmas tree and Menorah-lighting events must be held outside and adhere to gathering limits.

Ga. official pleads with Trump to condemn threats

Texto completo: Gabriel Sterling, a high-ranking Georgia elections official, walked to a lectern in the State Capitol in Atlanta­ Tuesday and angrily denounced the violent threats and harassment directed at people working on elections issues, urging President Trump to condemn them.
“It has to stop," said Sterling, a Republican. “Mr. President, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you're going to take a position of leadership, show some."
Sterling, a wonkish former city councilman in the Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs, has taken on a starring role as Georgia's voting system implementation manager while the president continues to call the election “rigged" and urge for the results to be nullified.
“Mr. President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia," Sterling said. “We're investigating. There's always a possibility, I get it, you have the right to go to the courts. What you don't have is the ability to — and you need to step up and say this — is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt. Someone's going to get shot. Someone's going to get killed."
Sterling's boss, Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, has come under fire from Trump allies, particularly Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia, Republicans who criticized Raffensperger's handling of the election and called for him to step down.
Lawsuits have been filed seeking to halt the certification of the results in Georgia. A second of two recounts, requested by the Trump campaign, is being conducted. The Internet and right-wing news media have flooded the state with baseless conspiracy theories.
Speaking loudly, emotionally, and deliberately, Sterling said that Raffensperger had intruders on his personal property. He said Raffensperger's wife was “getting sexualized threats thorough her cellphone." Sterling said he had police protection outside his own house.
He mentioned reports that Joe diGenova, a lawyer for the Trump campaign, said that Christopher Krebs — a federal cybersecurity official who was fired shortly after saying that the election was fair — should be shot.
But Sterling said “the straw that broke the camel's back" had to do with a contractor for a ­voting system company in Gwinnett County who was targeted by someone who hung a noose and said he should be “hung for treason" simply for doing a routine element of his job.

Trump raises $170 million since Election Day
President Trump has raised about $170 million since Election Day as his campaign operation has continued to aggressively solicit donations with hyped-up appeals that have funded his attempts to overturn the election and that have seeded his post-presidential political ambitions, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The money, much of which was raised in the first week after the election, according to the person, has arrived as Trump has made unsubstantiated claims about fraud and sought to undermine public confidence in the legitimacy of President-elect Joe Biden's victory.
Instead of slowing down after the election, Trump's campaign has ratcheted up its ­volume of e-mail solicitations for cash, telling supporters that money was needed for an “Election Defense Fund."
In reality, the fine print shows that the first 75 percent of every contribution currently goes to a new political action committee that Trump set up in mid-November, Save America, which can be used to fund his political activities going forward, including staff and travel. The other 25 percent of each donation is directed to the Republican National Committee.
A donor has to give $5,000 to Trump's new PAC before any funds go to his recount account.
Still, the Trump campaign continues to urgently ask for cash. On Monday, Trump signed a campaign e-mail that breathlessly told supporters that the end of November — nearly four weeks after Election Day — represented “our most IMPORTANT deadline EVER."
While a breakdown of the money was not immediately available, the deluge of donations would appear to have paid off any remaining Trump campaign debt (in the first days after the election, the fine print showed that contributions were earmarked for that purpose). The money is also likely to provide Trump with a sizable financial head start in paying for his post-presidency political activities.

White House plans series of parties, despite pandemic
WASHINGTON — The White House began the annual holiday party season on Monday, officials said, kicking off a spate of indoor holiday parties that commemorate various religious traditions over the season.
While many public health professionals have asked Americans not to congregate in large group settings and avoid travel over the holidays because of the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 266,000 Americans and infected 13 million more, the White House is expected to throw more than a dozen indoor parties, including a large congressional ball on Dec. 10, officials say.
The parties will be paid for by the Republican Party, a person with knowledge of the planning said, and will cost millions of dollars.
The president and the first lady are determined to have a final holiday season in the White House, officials said, and concerns about spiking cases and deaths across the country have not stopped the events. Many of the administration's supporters have taken a skeptical view of the restrictions over the virus and are choosing to attend, officials said.
Early Tuesday, Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady, said protocols will be taken to protect guests at the parties.
“This includes smaller guest lists, masks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor. Guests will enjoy food individually plated by chefs at plexiglass-protected food stations. All passed beverages will be covered. All service staff will wear masks and gloves to comply with food safety guidelines. Attending the parties will be a very personal choice," Grisham said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says indoor gatherings pose more risks than outdoor congregations, and “gatherings with more people pose more risk than gatherings with fewer people." But the CDC does not have a limit on the number of attendees for gatherings.
A number of events at the White House have previously been linked to coronavirus outbreaks, including a ceremony for Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett's nomination and an election night party. Besides the president, dozens of White House aides, including the chief of staff, the national security adviser, and the press secretary, have contracted the virus.

Texto completo: A photographer said four men dismantled the mysterious shiny object that has captivated the country. On Tuesday, a local outdoorsman with a penchant for stunts claimed credit for the disappearance.
It was, by most standards, a short stay. The pop-up metal monolith that became the focus of international attention after it was spotted in a remote section of the Utah desert on Nov. 18 was dismantled just 10 days later. On Tuesday a local outdoorsman with a penchant for stunts claimed credit on social media for the sculpture's removal.
The office of the San Juan County Sheriff at first announced that it was declining to investigate the case in the absence of complaints about missing property. To underscore that point, it uploaded a "Most Wanted" poster on its website, or rather a jokey version of one in which the faces of suspects were replaced by nine big-eyed aliens. But by the end of Monday, the sheriff's office had reversed its position and announced that it was planning a joint investigation with the Bureau of Land Management, a federal agency.
It was left to an adventure photographer, Ross Bernards, to disclose evidence on Instagram. Mr. Bernards, 34, of Edwards, Colo., was visiting the monolith on Friday night when, he said, four men arrived as if out of nowhere to dismantle the sculpture. Mr. Bernards had driven six hours for the chance to ogle the sculpture and to take dramatic photographs of it. Using upscale Lume Cube lights attached to a drone, he produced a series of glowy, moonlit pictures in which the monolith glistens against the red cliffs and the deep blue of the night sky.
Suddenly, around 8:40 p.m., he said, the men arrived, their voices echoing in the canyon. Working in twosomes, with an unmistakable sense of purpose, they gave the monolith hard shoves, and it started to tilt toward the ground. Then they pushed it in the opposite direction, trying to uproot it.
"This is why you don't leave trash in the desert," one of them said, suggesting that he viewed the monolith as an eyesore, a pollutant to the landscape, according to Mr. Bernards.
The sculpture popped out and landed on the ground with a bang. Then the men broke it apart and ferried it off in a wheelbarrow.
"As they walked off with the pieces, one of them said, 'Leave no trace,"' Mr. Bernards recalled in a telephone interview.
He did not photograph the men who took down the sculpture, saying he "didn't want to start a confrontation by bringing out my camera and putting it in their face -- especially since I agreed with what they were doing."
But a friend who accompanied him on the trip, Michael James Newlands, 38, of Denver, took a few quick photographs with his cellphone.
"It must have been 10 or 15 minutes at most for them to knock over the monolith and pull it out," he told The New York Times. "We didn't know who they were, and we were not going to do anything to stop them." He added, "They just came in there to execute and they were like, 'This is our mission."'
The photos are blurry, but they fascinate, nonetheless. Here are images of several men working beneath the cover of darkness, wearing gloves but not face masks, standing above the fallen monolith. We can see its exposed insides. It turns out to be a hollow structure with an armature made from plywood.
The photographs are the only known images of the culprits who removed the sculpture; they may not have been the same people who installed it in the first place.
On Tuesday, Andy L. Lewis, a professional sportsman in nearby Moab, Utah, took credit for the sculpture's removal with his group, posting a video on his Facebook page. Mr. Lewis is a 34-year-old slackline performer who specializes in high-altitude stunts and brought his sport to Madonna's 2012 Super Bowl halftime show.
His video consists of a short, shadowy clip, barely half a minute long, that shows the monolith lying in a wheelbarrow, as someone quickly rolls it out of the park. "The safe word is run," one man says, as his headlamp illuminates the fallen sculpture.
His friend, Sylvan Christensen, who said he had taken part in the dismantling of the sculpture, sent a statement to The New York Times on Tuesday evening explaining that the group took it upon themselves to destroy the sculpture to protect the area -- not only from the incursion of a silvery sculpture but also from the gawkers who had begun descending to see it. "This land wasn't physically prepared for the population shift," they wrote, adding that the public needs to be educated about proper land use and management.
But Mr. Lewis has not always been so supportive of the challenges faced by the Bureau of Land Management. He pleaded guilty in federal court in Utah in 2014 to lying to rangers at Arches National Park. He was accused of hindering their investigation into BASE jumping, a sport that Mr. Lewis practices. At the time, the Bureau of Land Management was trying to prohibit such aerial sports, which can damage the home of owls, bighorn sheep and other animals that inhabit the desert. Mr. Lewis was fined $ 965 and was put on 18-months probation, during which time he was prohibited from entering a national park.
Asked if they were focusing on any suspects, Alan Freestone, chief deputy with the San Juan County Sheriff's Office, said on Tuesday, "I know they have some leads, and that's all we are saying right now."
Artists had been casually speculating that whoever put the sculpture up probably had taken it down once it was discovered, as if aspiring to be anonymous artist-activists, the Banksy of the desert.
But art-world speculation had not yielded too many facts. Initially, the monolith was linked to John McCracken, a California-born artist who died in 2011 and harbored a taste for science fiction. David Zwirner, the New York art dealer who represents the artist's estate and first identified the monolith as an authentic McCracken, stepped forward on Monday to tell The Times that he had studied photographs of it and no longer had any idea who had made it.
Almine Rech, who represents the artist at her galleries in Paris and Brussels, also contacted a reporter to deny that the desert monolith was a McCracken.
And news stories spread of a copycat monolith sighting in the hills of Romania.
All of this leaves us not an iota closer to solving the mystery of who created the Utah sculpture.
On the plus side, the monolith that captivated the country over the past week, then disappeared as quickly as it entered public consciousness, continues to provide a pleasant sensation of uncertainty. Would it lose its aura and power if we knew who had created it?
Susan Beachy contributed research. Cellphone photos show four men dismantling the monolith in Utah on Friday. Two Utah residents later said they took part in the removal. (PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHAEL JAMES NEWLANDS)

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
It wasn’t the year for celebration. But watching innovation flourish inspired our chief critic, while other writers found the joys of the stage in other media.
Best Theater of 2020
A Top 10 list in a Worst 10 year is a strange undertaking. But as I looked back at 2020, even considering the disaster that divided it into before and after, I found that theater was still doing what it does at its best: showing us how we live right now, and how we might live better.
That’s not always the case. Typical seasons offer a selection of titles planned years in advance and sorted by happenstance. But once the stages were locked down in March, throwing thousands out of work, 2020 turned into a year in which theater was of necessity purpose-built, in real time, from scratch. There was some irony in that; it was, after all, the vanishing of the dinosaurs — the corporate Broadway musicals, the 16-week movie-star vehicles — that allowed the smaller, better adapted new works to poke their heads out.
Those shows, however makeshift and mediated by a screen, matched the moment better than most seasons’ shows match theirs. If you follow the calendar (my list is basically chronological), you can see how the online productions I highlight, as well as a few that came before the shutdown, trace a compelling passage through the pandemic year. Together, they helped us move from premonitions through panic toward a new — and often exciting — abnormal. — JESSE GREEN
‘Hamlet’
Only one American had yet died of COVID-19 when the Gate Theater production of “Hamlet,” starring Ethiopian Irish actor Ruth Negga, opened at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn on Feb. 9. Yet in Yaël Farber’s staging, whose spookiest bits were set in the midst of the audience, the usual ghosts and corpses came off as more than whispery premonitions. They were heart-stopping warnings — and Negga, as an unusually quicksilver prince, had to decide along with us what it might mean to avenge the dead.
‘Dana H.’
What seemed at first like paranoia but turned out to be prescience entered the theatrical season with the opening of Lucas Hnath’s “Dana H.” at the Vineyard Theater. It wasn’t just the haunting true story, about the abduction of Hnath’s mother by a violent psychopath, that had audiences hunting for the panic button. The play’s peculiar method, in which Deirdre O’Connell brilliantly lip-synced her role, gave the drama an almost unbearable aura of dissociation, matching a moment when it was beginning to feel as if we, too, were about to be abducted.
‘Girl From the North Country’
Who would have guessed that of all the shows to open before the theaters closed, the most moving would be a jukebox musical? But “Girl From the North Country,” which arrived on Broadway on March 5, after productions in London and at the Public Theater, was like no jukebox ever, with tunes (by Bob Dylan) that, instead of simplistically illustrating the story of Depression-era poverty, contextualized it in cloud of sorrow and hope. Conor McPherson’s script and direction made it clear that the harm people do to one another is always new, if never news.
Benefits
The U.S. death count was still just 107 on March 12, but it was enough to shut down the industry. Nevertheless, within a few weeks, the first signs of new theatrical life — online — emerged in the form of benefits: Rosie O’Donnell’s variety show in March and then, in April, “Take Me to the World,” a 90th-birthday celebration of Stephen Sondheim. Glitchy, audio-challenged and not much to look at, they were nevertheless stuffed with beautifully timely hymns to hope (Kelli O’Hara with a Sondheim song that seemed to have been written for the shutdown) and raucously dazzling outbursts (Meryl Streep, Audra McDonald and Christine Baranski going full blitz with “The Ladies Who Lunch”). Between them, the shows raised more than $1 million for the Actors Fund and Artists Striving to End Poverty.
‘Mama Got a Cough’
By May, we knew that theater people would find ways to produce new work one way or another, but would we ever have permission to laugh at it again? “Mama Got a Cough,” a 14-minute film by playwright Jordan E. Cooper, didn’t just give us that permission, but insisted on it, even in the midst of tragedy. The story of five dysfunctional siblings (one played by Danielle Brooks) negotiating a Zoom call with their ill but hilariously feisty mother (Juanita Jennings), it pointed the way toward a kind of theater-in-exile that instead of circumventing the headlines incorporated them.
Equitable Dinners
On a visit to Atlanta just before the shutdown, I learned about local theater dinners at which community members came together over potluck to watch a play about a pressing issue and discuss it afterward. By April, Out of Hand theater had taken the “dinners” online — opening them up to larger and more diverse audiences. In June, three weeks after the killing of George Floyd, I caught one about economic discrimination, including a searing 10-minute monologue by playwright Avery Sharpe. That dinner (there have been six more since) did what I always hope theater can do: not close wounds but open them, challenge the moral imagination and model ways toward the future.
‘Three Kings’
By the end of the summer, theater artists, working with better technology, had their online act together, producing streamed plays that were sometimes as slick as movies. “Three Kings,” from London’s Old Vic, could have been merely that, with multicamera magic courtesy of the director, Matthew Warchus. But Andrew Scott, making a three-course meal out of Stephen Beresford’s story of a man coming to terms with his father’s emotional cruelty, proved that a great stage performance is different from a great film one because, even at an electronic remove, it somehow encompasses its audience.
‘The Great Work Begins’
In October, after more than 200,000 coronavirus-related deaths in the United States, the creators of “The Great Work Begins,” subtitled “Scenes From ‘Angels in America,’ ” could not ignore the parallels between the current pandemic and AIDS, which over the course of four decades has killed millions worldwide. In five brilliantly imaginative excerpts, distilling Tony Kushner’s seven-hour epic to 50 minutes, director Ellie Heyman and a cast both starry (Glenn Close as Roy Cohn) and multifarious (three Priors, three Belizes, all excellent) showed how classic plays speak not only to their time but also predict their own futures — often, as here, with fury and regret.
‘Russian Troll Farm’
With no end to the pandemic in sight, theater-makers had to face the fact that repurposing existing stage works was not going to produce vibrant new ones for our changed world. Just in time, “Russian Troll Farm,” by Sarah Gancher, showed that digital-native productions could make the medium maximally expressive — in this case by exploring the world of online Russian election disrupters using an online aesthetic. It took two directors (Jared Mezzocchi and Elizabeth Williamson) and three companies (TheaterWorks Hartford, Theater Squared in Arkansas and the Brooklyn-based Civilians) to pull it off, but it was a key step forward and a wicked-smart ride.
‘Lessons in Survival’
As it had with “Dana H.” in February, the Vineyard Theater closed out the fall with work that had actors channeling voices coming into their ears from recordings. But in “Lessons in Survival,” an online series with eight episodes so far, the recordings, made between 1964 and 2008, captured the voices of leading Black thinkers, including James Baldwin and Angela Davis, dissecting the state of American democracy. At the end of a brutal year, it was bracing to hear them (joining a wave of other newly political plays) speak truth to power; they put the words right into our mouths.

11 Ways We Found Theater Without Theater
“Gray skies are gonna clear up/Put on a happy face,” goes that irrepressible lyric from “Bye Bye Birdie.” Not quite the 2020 vibe. But like the troupers who insist that the show must go on, theater fans who looked hard could find the pleasures of the stage without squeezing into a middle (or any) seat. Much came through screens, of course, but joy, ingenuity and pathos arrived in other packages, too — igniting new forms and minting new stars along the way. — SCOTT HELLER
Mary Neely
Many of us were shellshocked back in March, when swaths of the country were in lockdown. Luckily, Mary Neely took action. Quarantining alone in her Los Angeles home, the young actress started tweeting short videos in which she lip-synced, with eerie accuracy, songs from classic musicals. Overflowing with humor, ingenuity and unabashed nerdiness, the videos grew increasingly elaborate, culminating in a multipart re-enactment of “Beauty and the Beast” in which Neely played all the roles. For a few heroic weeks, she was a one-woman incarnation of musical theater itself. — ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
‘The 40-Year-Old Version’
A love letter to theater written in sweat equity, and an unrepentant indictment of a white-run theater that thrives on Black pain, Radha Blank’s “The 40-Year-Old Version” debuted on Netflix in October. Blank, a former playwright, includes a zinger about a multiracial revival of “Fences” and a gloomier story line about a new play workshopped into subscriber-pleasing nonsense. The movie’s most cathartic moment? An unctuous white producer (in a brilliant turn by theater stalwart Reed Birney) suggests that Blank’s character write the book for his Harriet Tubman musical. She chokes him. — ALEXIS SOLOSKI
‘Hamnet’
The cover of Maggie O’Farrell’s “Hamnet” calls it “A Novel of the Plague,” but don’t let that put you off. This superbly imagined book, which won the 2020 Women’s Prize for Fiction, is bursting with life. Named for Shakespeare’s son, who died at 11, it twines the child’s brief illness with his parents’ long coupledom. Shadows of Shakespeare’s plays flicker through this novel, yet its indelible figure is his wife, Agnes — kind seer, herbal healer, Stratford rebel extraordinaire. If her mother was a forest sprite, what of it? — LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
‘Pen15’
The Hulu comedy “Pen15” is theatrical to begin with, its premise demanding suspension of disbelief: Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, actresses in their 30s, star as 13-year-old best friends Maya and Anna, alongside actual kids as their fellow seventh graders. So it is maybe unsurprising that the show’s detour into the realm of the school play, with Maya landing a lead role and Anna working backstage, was not merely knowing but also sublime. In the last two episodes released in 2020, characters suffused with adolescent awkwardness found, on the stage, an aching, bittersweet grace. — LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES
TikTok musicals
Broadway has been closed for most of the year, yet new musicals keep coming — in bite-size segments. After the composer-arranger Daniel Mertzlufft riffed off two lines from the Louisa Melcher song “New York Summer,” fellow TikTok devotees made use of the duet function to add refrains from new characters — including a produce water mister and a can of soup — to fill out “Grocery Store.” Mertzlufft also had a finger in what became a true TikTok blockbuster, “Ratatouille: The Musical,” based on the 2007 Pixar movie. It began with a retooled song for the rat Remy by the young New Yorker Emily Jacobsen. A crowdsourced virtual show followed, with original numbers, sets and costumes, choreography, even a mock Playbill. Could a Tony Award be that far-off? — ELISABETH VINCENTELLI
Machine Dazzle’s Instagram
If you’ve been lucky enough to see Taylor Mac live, it’s hard to argue with The New Yorker’s claim that his costume designer Machine Dazzle is a “genius.” And during a lockdown summer in which spectacle was in short order, Dazzle’s Instagram feed delivered a burst of brilliance — sequin-free. Fleeing to Maui without his usual supplies, he turned palm fronds and other tropical vegetation into masks, headpieces and other disguises. As I learned later, they were all perishable, so the deadpan photos are all that remains of this triumph of make-do inspiration. — SCOTT HELLER
‘Katy Keene’ and ‘Riverdale’
“Katy Keene,” a story of young strivers and piano bar habitués, lasted only a season. But in March, as most states entered lockdown, it gifted viewers with a musical episode, a tribute to Kander and Ebb’s “Kiss of the Spider-Woman.” (Stage a musical about torture and forbidden love in an Argentine prison? Those crazy kids.) In April, over on its sibling series, “Riverdale,” the teens also put on a show, a high-school version of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” giving strange rock and rollers and musical theater fans a way to hold on. — ALEXIS SOLOSKI
‘Cairns’
Stages became smaller this year. So small you could shove one into your pocket. The closure of most conventional theaters has created mini surge of plays and musicals produced for your phone. In the surpassingly lovely “Cairns,” composer and musicologist Gelsey Bell guided you, earbuds first, on a sound walk through Green-Wood Cemetery, asking you to contemplate the natural world and human interventions within it. (If you preferred to contemplate mortality without leaving your home, Darkfield Radio offered “Visitors,” a sound experience for two participants recorded in eerie binaural audio.) — ALEXIS SOLOSKI
‘Staged’
Ah, pompous thespians, how we’ve missed you! Thank Hulu (and the BBC) for this zippy six-episode series, which finds David Tennant and Michael Sheen in lockdown, Zoom-dueling their way through fraught rehearsals for (yeesh) a Pirandello play. Sheen, a shaggy Welshman, and Tennant, a stringy Scot, offer a wonderful visual contrast. Then they open their mouths: bickering over billing, accents, Shakespearean triumphs and Samuel L. Jackson. “Just because you’re mumbling,” Tennant snarls in the fourth and funniest episode, “doesn’t mean it’s good.” — SCOTT HELLER
‘BoJack Horseman’
“Acting is about leaving everything behind and becoming something completely new,” the narcissistic former Hollywood star declares to the mirror as the second half of the show’s masterly final season begins. Teaching Intermediate Scene Study to undergraduate hacks at Wesleyan University offers BoJack yet another avenue to redemption (he’s a decent director of these Olivier wannabes) and provides the animated Netflix series a funny yet heartbreaking last arc. But the real treats for stage stans were the cute animal-pun theater references throughout: I, for one, would love seats to Sam German Shepard’s “Real America” and “A Bleatcar Named Desire.” — MAYA PHILLIPS
‘The Plastic Bag Store’
When Robin Frohardt’s “The Plastic Bag Store” opened this fall in Times Square, it was much modified from her pre-pandemic vision. There were no live performances of her immersive puppet play, no passersby admitted between shows to see her art installation: an intricate replica of a grocery store, made from plastic waste. Instead, tiny, distanced audiences entered to watch a gorgeously filmed version of the play. Yet one live actor still popped up; set changes revealed hidden scenery. This was almost-theater — a vital, intoxicating dose. — LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

Texto completo: The Utah monolith that inspired a host of conspiracy theories and various Reddit threads from science fiction enthusiasts disappeared almost as quickly as it rose to internet fame — and one photographer watched it happen.
The monolith, a three-sided statue made of metal with no engravings or writing of any kind, was seemingly first discovered on Nov. 18 while surveyors studied populations of bighorn sheep, according to the New York Times. It is unclear when exactly the work was installed, but Reddit users who discovered the coordinates of the monolith used Google Earth photo archives to determine that it appeared somewhere between 2015 and 2016.
On Monday, photographer Ross Bernards posted on Instagram pictures of the structure, its removal, and his account of the events that unfolded. Bernards and three friends went to see the sculpture Friday night when he says four men came up to the monument to take it down.
"They gave a couple of pushes on the monolith and one of them said 'You better have got your pictures,'" Bernards wrote in the post. "He then gave it a big push, and it went over, leaning to one side."
Bernards said the men broke the sculpture into pieces and carried it out on a wheelbarrow, and one man instructed the group to "leave no trace."
The incident lasted fewer than 15 minutes.

It's unclear whether the men who removed the monolith were involved in its installation, but it appears unlikely based on Bernards' account. He overheard them saying, "This is why you don't leave trash in the desert."
At the time of the removal, Utah's Bureau of Land Management said it did not remove the sculpture and would not conduct an investigation into the removal since it was considered private property.
"We have received credible reports that the illegally installed structure, referred to as the 'monolith,' has been removed from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public lands by an unknown party," the BLM wrote in an official statement. "The BLM did not remove the structure which is considered private property."
No one knows who placed the monolith, which required the use of precision tools to bore a triangular hole into the rock, or how it arrived at such a remote location, according to a spokesman for the Utah Department of Public Safety.
Officials speculated that the structure was the work of sculptor and science fiction aficionado John McCracken, who was known for creating minimalist sculptures. McCracken's son told the New York Times that his father said, "He would like to leave his artwork in remote places to be discovered later."
Some in the art world have disputed that claim, including David Zwirner, an art dealer who represents McCracken's estate, and Almine Rech, who represents artists in her galleries in Paris, according to the New York Times. However, it could have been completed by someone inspired by the likes of McCracken.
McCracken died in 2011 at the age of 76. Even if it was his work, based on the Google Maps data, it is unlikely he installed it.
Despite going to see the sculpture himself, Bernards said the men were right to remove it, citing the damage that the influx of visitors to such a remote portion of Utah's landscape had done.
"They were right to take it out," Bernards wrote. "We stayed the night and the next day hiked to a hill top overlooking the area, where we saw at least 70 different cars (and a plane) in and out. Cars parking everywhere in the delicate desert landscape. Nobody following a path or each other. We could literally see people trying to approach it from every direction to try and reach it, permanently altering the untouched landscape."
The Washington Examiner reached out to Bernards for further comment.

The smooth, tall structure was found during a helicopter survey of bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, officials said Monday. State workers from the Utah Department of Public Safety and Division of Wildlife Resources spotted the gleaming object from the air and landed nearby to check it out. The exact location is so remote that officials are not revealing it publicly, worried that people might get lost or stranded trying to find it and need to be rescued.

Texto completo: President-elect Joe Biden is set to move into the White House in January, but the basement could come with him.
Republicans are already pillorying Biden for keeping a relatively low profile, but Democrats think that could be exactly what the voters want after four years of the ubiquitous President Trump.
A hairline fracture in Biden’s right foot sustained while playing with his dog is the latest thing that could sideline the 78-year-old incoming president, who was mocked by opponents for frequently calling early ends to his day and keeping a light public schedule for most of the presidential campaign.
“I don't think it is a positive first step for this new administration, but it could be a very apt metaphor for the new president,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. “He is starting off as a lame duck, both figuratively and literally.”
Democrats are quick to point out that the jibes about Biden's basement encampment did little to derail his candidacy, despite GOP predictions that Trump’s busy rally schedule would carry the day. Biden’s approach differed from Trump’s aggressive style and, to some, better reflected the realities of the pandemic, which has forced millions to embrace social distancing to slow the spread of COVID-19. And 51.1% of the electorate responded favorably to the quieter candidate, though Trump has yet to concede and is still contesting the results in multiple states.
“Most Americans were tired of Donald Trump getting in their faces every day. Joe Biden, a direct descendant of the ‘No Drama Obama’ administration, understood that Americans needed a mental vacation from Trump's daily trials and tribulations and ran a low-profile campaign,” said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon. “Biden believes that less is more when it comes to presidential visibility and power. Republicans can and will complain. But Americans will find a low-profile presidency a welcome relief after four long, hard years of Trump.”
“One of the worst aspects of Trump’s presidency is the way he simply consumed all of our mental bandwidth, so that it became all but impossible to think of anyone or anything else,” opined Bret Stephens, a Never Trump conservative columnist, in the New York Times. “Experiencing his presidency was like a bad reaction to dog dander. Or a painfully long bout of hiccups. Or trying to swat away a determined mosquito as it buzzes your ear as you are drifting off to sleep. Or a 6 a.m. car alarm that won’t stop. Or a case of poison ivy in some delicate part of the anatomy.”
The president’s supporters counter that Biden was not being fully transparent, staying quiet in order to avoid gaffes or even conceal from voters signs of age-related decline. Reporters are also anticipating Biden, who recently announced his expected White House communications team, will be selective about media interviews, a practice for which Trump was sometimes criticized.
Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were occasionally criticized for failing to take questions from the press after delivering remarks. Reporters also chastised Trump for not taking questions for three weeks following the election, including at an appearance at the podium with Vice President Mike Pence to celebrate the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 30,000.
Trump’s dominance over the airwaves in 2016 helped him defeat 16 more-established Republican presidential candidates and then overcome Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s paid advertising edge in the fall. A frequent subject of tabloid coverage as a New York City real estate developer, Trump at times appeared to believe in the maxim attributed to P.T. Barnum: “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.”
But Biden was already well known after eight years as vice president under Barack Obama and wanted to frame the election largely as a referendum on Trump rather than a binary choice between the incumbent and himself. A lower profile was consistent with that strategy.
As someone who explicitly campaigned on the idea of being a calming presence in the Oval Office compared to Trump, Biden might bring this modus operandi to the White House. “I sometimes fear the Trump administration has reduced us, emotionally and intellectually, to a single thought, played like a Gregorian chant on an endless loop,” complained the New York Times’s Stephens. “Just. Make. It. Stop.”

Byron York's Daily Memo: A New York Times embarrassment

A NEW YORK TIMES EMBARRASSMENT. On Monday evening, the Times' Paul Krugman posted a column declaring that when Joe Biden becomes president, "he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge." The challenge, Krugman said, is that Biden will be "the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy.”
Krugman seemed to anticipate that some would respond that some Democrats refused to accept Donald Trump's legitimacy. But that never happened, Krugman claimed. "And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate," he wrote, "just that he was incompetent and dangerous."
Does anyone at the New York Times read Krugman's column before it's published? Of course some Democrats said Trump was illegitimate. Hillary Clinton said so last year. "He [Trump] knows he's an illegitimate president," Clinton told CBS's "60 Minutes" on September 29, 2019.

And it started much earlier than that. On January 16, 2017, when Trump had been in office less than a week, a senior House Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, conceded to CNN that Trump had been "legally elected," but argued that the Russian attempt to interfere in the 2016 campaign "makes his election illegitimate."
Then there was Rep. John Lewis. On January 13, 2017, a week before Trump took the oath of office, the late Democratic icon said of Trump, "I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president." Lewis refused to attend Trump's inauguration, leading a number of other House Democrats -- close to 20 of them, including Nadler -- to boycott the inauguration as well, saying they wanted to "stand with" Lewis. Given Lewis's stature in the Democratic Party, and in the country as a whole, his comments sparked an extensive discussion on the question of Trump's legitimacy.
Among those taking part in that discussion was...Paul Krugman. "Let's ask whether Mr. Lewis was right to say what he said," Krugman wrote in the Times on January 16, 2017. "Is it OK, morally and politically, to declare the man about to move into the White House illegitimate? Yes, it is. In fact, it's an act of patriotism.”

So Democrats did, in fact, say that Trump was illegitimate. And Paul Krugman not only knew of such statements, he cheered them on at the time. And now Krugman writes, "Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate." Oh, come on.
In Trump's first year in office, there was widespread debate about whether he was a legitimate president. On March 18, 2017, the Associated Press reported that a recent poll found that "a majority of young adults -- 57 percent -- see Trump's presidency as illegitimate."
The talk never went away. In May, 2019, at a campaign event in New Hampshire, a woman told candidate Joe Biden that Trump was "an illegitimate president, in my mind...he's illegitimate." Biden responded, "Look, folks, I absolutely agree." He jokingly asked if she would be his running mate.
In June, 2019, former President Jimmy Carter suggested that Trump owed his election to Russian interference. When his interviewer asked whether that meant Trump was an illegitimate president, Carter agreed.
So there it is: John Lewis. Jerrold Nadler. A group of Democratic lawmakers. Hillary Clinton. Jimmy Carter. And Joe Biden himself, the next Democratic president. How many Democrats have to call Trump illegitimate before Paul Krugman recognizes that they called Trump illegitimate?
The attempt to throw it all down the memory hole is more than just an embarrassment for Krugman and the New York Times. It also encourages a sense of grievance -- They won't accept Biden's legitimacy! -- that is utterly ignorant of recent events. Some Democrats not only declared Donald Trump an illegitimate president before he was even sworn in -- they spent the next years trying to remove him from office, abusing the powers of investigation in the hope that even if he survived he would be so weakened that he could not win re-election. No one should forget -- or ignore -- what happened.

Bret Stephens: Thank you, Justice Gorsuch

Texto completo: It may take a terrorist attack, a war or some other national emergency, but America will one day thank Justice Neil Gorsuch for his stirring words last week in Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo. “Government,” he wrote in a concurrence to the 5-4 majority opinion, “is not free to disregard the First Amendment in times of crisis.”
The case arises from restrictions Andrew Cuomo imposed by executive order in October that sharply limit attendance at houses of worship in zones designated by the New York governor as pandemic hot spots. In so-called orange zones, attendance is capped at 25 people; in red zones, at 10. That goes for churches and synagogues that can seat hundreds and that were already limiting attendance, barring singing, practicing social distancing and taking other precautions.
The Catholic diocese, along with Agudath Israel of America and affiliated entities, sued, arguing the restrictions amounted to religious discrimination. The crux of the matter was that businesses in orange and red zones, ranging from liquor stores to bike shops to acupuncturists, were subject to no such restrictions because the governor had deemed them “essential.”
“So, at least according to the governor, it may be unsafe to go to church, but it is always fine to pick up another bottle of wine, shop for a new bike or spend the afternoon exploring your distal points and meridians,” Gorsuch wrote. “Who knew public health would so perfectly align with secular convenience?”
The Supreme Court’s decision only temporarily prevents Cuomo from enforcing his executive order, pending a decision by a U.S. Court of Appeals. But it marks an important departure from similar cases earlier this year, in which the court deferred to the judgment of governors for how best to handle the pandemic. It also rejects the view (argued by New York state) that Cuomo treats houses of worship in red zones more favorably than he does, say, movie theaters. The right to the free exercise of religion, even if subject to regulation, deserves greater deference than the right to attend your local cineplex.
What changed? Most obviously, the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her replacement by Amy Coney Barrett.
But other factors clearly weighed on Gorsuch and the four other conservative justices who voted with him. (Chief Justice John Roberts dissented.) One was time. It was one thing for courts to defer to executive authority in the early days of the crisis. But how long can governors override fundamental rights? “Even if the Constitution has taken a holiday during this pandemic, it cannot become a sabbatical,” Gorsuch wrote.
Another was the game of Hot Zone Whac-a-Mole that Cuomo tried to play with the court as the case was working its way through the legal system, by switching the affected areas’ designations back to “yellow.” That was enough to convince Roberts and other dissenters that they could leave well enough alone, at least for now. But, as Gorsuch noted, one also has to be modest about judicial modesty: “We may not shelter in place when the Constitution is under attack. Things never go well when we do.”
That’s a thought that ought to inspire everyone, liberals most of all. Imagine slightly different circumstances, in which, say, a conservative governor of a red state had used pandemic concerns last summer to impose draconian limits on public protests and that he had done so using color-coded maps that focused on denser urban areas and that seemed to apply most restrictively to predominantly Black neighborhoods.
Now imagine this governor had, at the same time, loosened restrictions on large gatherings such as motorcycle rallies, business conventions and football games — on the grounds that these were essential to the economic well-being of the state. Any objections?
The point here isn’t that the interests of public safety and respect for executive authority must always and fully give way to the assertion of constitutional rights. They shouldn’t and don’t. Nor is the point that the behavior of religious communities during the pandemic has been beyond reproach or beyond the reach of justifiable legal sanction. It hasn’t.
The point is there are no second-class rights — and the right to the free exercise of religion is every bit as important to the Constitution as the right to assemble peaceably, petition government for redress, and speak and publish freely. That goes in circumstances both ordinary and extraordinary. As Justice Samuel Alito put it in a speech this month that caused some gnashing of teeth: “All sorts of things can be called an emergency or disaster of major proportions. Simply slapping on that label cannot provide the ground for abrogating our most fundamental rights.”
There is a perennial danger that rights denied or abridged during one emergency for one class of people will ultimately be denied during another emergency for another class. The reverse is also true. The victory for conservatives in last week’s ruling will be a victory for liberals somewhere down the road. The precedent set by the ruling, and the power of Gorsuch’s concurrence, will make the victory sweeter.

Paul Krugman: How will Biden deal with Republican sabotage

Texto completo: When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge — and I don’t mean the pandemic, although COVID-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he’ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.
It goes without saying that Trump, whose conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder, will never concede, and that millions of his followers will always believe — or at least say they believe — that the election was stolen.
Most Republicans in Congress certainly know this is a lie, although even on Capitol Hill there are a lot more crazy than we’d like to imagine. But it doesn’t matter; they still won’t accept that Biden has any legitimacy, even though he won the popular vote by a large margin.
And this won’t simply be because they fear a backlash from the base if they admit that Trump lost fair and square. At a fundamental level — and completely separate from the Trump factor — today’s GOP doesn’t believe that Democrats ever have the right to govern, no matter how many votes they receive.
After all, in recent years we’ve seen what happens when a state with a Republican legislature elects a Democratic governor: Legislators quickly try to strip away the governor’s powers. So does anyone doubt that Republicans will do all they can to hobble and sabotage Biden’s presidency?
The only real questions are how much harm the GOP can do and how Biden will respond.
The answer to the first question depends a lot on what happens in the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs. If Democrats win both seats, they’ll have effective though narrow control of both houses of Congress. If they don’t, Mitch McConnell will have enormous powers of obstruction — and anyone who doubts that he’ll use those powers to undermine Biden at every turn is living in a fantasy world.
But how much damage would obstructionism inflict? In terms of economic policy — which is all I’ll talk about in this column — the near future can be divided into two eras, pre- and post-vaccine (or more accurately, after wide dissemination of a vaccine).
For the next few months, as the pandemic continues to run wild, tens of millions of Americans will be in desperate straits unless the federal government steps up to help. Unfortunately, Republicans may be in a position to block this help.
The good news about the very near future, such as it is, is that Americans will probably (and correctly) blame Donald Trump, not Joe Biden, for the misery they’re experiencing — and this very fact may make Republicans willing to cough up at least some money.
What about the post-vaccine economy? Here again there’s potentially some good news: Once a vaccine becomes widely available, we’ll probably see a spontaneous economic recovery, one that won’t depend on Republican cooperation. And there will also be a vast national sense of relief.
So Biden might do OK for a while even in the face of scorched-earth Republican opposition. But we can’t be sure of that. Republicans might refuse to confirm anyone for key economic positions. There’s always the possibility of another financial crisis — and outgoing Trump officials have been systematically undermining the incoming administration’s ability to deal with such a crisis if it happens. And America desperately needs action on issues from infrastructure to climate change to tax enforcement that won’t happen if Republicans retain blocking power.
So what can Biden do?
First, he needs to start talking about immediate policy actions to help ordinary Americans, if only to make it clear to Georgia voters how much damage will be done if they don’t elect Democrats to those two Senate seats.
If Democrats don’t get those seats, Biden will need to use executive action to accomplish as much as possible despite Republican obstruction — although I worry that the Trump-stacked Supreme Court will try to block him when he does.
Finally, although Biden is still talking in a comforting way about unity and reaching across the aisle, at some point he’ll need to stop reassuring us that he’s nothing like Trump and start making Republicans pay a political price for their attempts to prevent him from governing.
Now, I don’t mean that he should sound like Trump, demanding retribution against his enemies — although the Justice Department should be allowed to do its job and prosecute whatever Trump-era crimes it finds.
No, what Biden needs to do is what Harry Truman did in 1948, when he built political support by running against “do-nothing” Republicans. And he’ll have a better case than Truman ever did, because today’s Republicans are infinitely more corrupt and less patriotic than the Republicans Truman faced.
The results of this year’s election, with a solid Biden win but Republicans doing well down ballot, tells us that American voters don’t fully understand what the modern GOP is really about. Biden needs to get that point across and make Republicans pay for the sabotage we all know is coming.

Texto completo: It was, by most standards, a short stay. The pop-up metal monolith that became the focus of international attention after it was spotted in a remote section of the Utah desert on Nov. 18 was dismantled just 10 days later. Government officials continued to insist Monday that they had no information about either the installation or removal — and possible theft — of the piece, which had been placed on public land.
The office of the San Juan County Sheriff at first announced that it was declining to investigate the case in the absence of complaints about missing property. To underscore that point, it uploaded a “Most Wanted” poster on its website, or rather a jokey version of one in which the faces of suspects were replaced by nine big-eyed aliens. But by the end of Monday, the sheriff’s office had reversed its position and announced that it was planning a joint investigation with the Bureau of Land Management, a federal agency.
It was left to an adventure photographer, Ross Bernards, to disclose evidence on Instagram. Bernards, 34, of Edwards, Colorado, was visiting the monolith Friday night when, he said, four men arrived as if out of nowhere to dismantle the sculpture. Bernards had driven six hours for the chance to ogle the sculpture and to take dramatic photographs of it. Using upscale Lume Cube lights attached to a drone, he produced a series of glowy, moonlit pictures in which the monolith glistens against the red cliffs and the deep blue of the night sky.
Suddenly, around 8:40 p.m., he said, the men arrived, their voices echoing in the canyon. Working in twosomes, with an unmistakable sense of purpose, they gave the monolith hard shoves, and it started to tilt toward the ground. Then they pushed it in the opposite direction, trying to uproot it.

“This is why you don’t leave trash in the desert,” one of them said, suggesting that he viewed the monolith as an eyesore, a pollutant to the landscape, according to Bernards.
The sculpture popped out and landed on the ground with a bang. Then the men broke it apart and ferried it off in a wheelbarrow.
“As they walked off with the pieces, one of them said, ‘Leave no trace,’ " Bernards recalled in a telephone interview.
He did not photograph the men who took down the sculpture, saying he feared a confrontation with them and worried they might be armed. But a friend who accompanied him on the trip, Michael James Newlands, 38, of Denver, took a few quick photographs with his cellphone.
“It must have been 10 or 15 minutes at most for them to knock over the monolith and pull it out,” he told The New York Times. “We didn’t know who they were, and we were not going to do anything to stop them.” He added, “They just came in there to execute and they were like, ‘This is our mission.’ "
The photos are blurry, but they fascinate, nonetheless. They are images of several men working beneath the cover of darkness, wearing gloves but not face masks, standing above the fallen monolith. We can see its exposed insides. It turns out to be a hollow structure with an armature made from plywood.
The photographs are the only known images of the culprits who removed the sculpture; they may not have been the same people who installed it in the first place. Lt. Nick Street, a spokesman for the Utah Department of Public Safety, said last week that the monolith had been embedded into the rock.

In the past few days, artists had been casually speculating that whoever put the sculpture up probably had taken it down once it was discovered, as if aspiring to be anonymous artist-activists, the Banksy of the desert.
But art-world speculation had not yielded too many facts. Initially, the monolith was linked to John McCracken, a California-born artist who died in 2011 and harbored a taste for science fiction. David Zwirner, the New York art dealer who represents the artist’s estate and first identified the monolith as an authentic McCracken, stepped forward Monday to tell The Times that he had studied photographs of it and no longer had any idea who had made it.
Almine Rech, who represents the artist at her galleries in Paris and Brussels, also contacted a reporter to deny that the desert monolith was a McCracken.
And news stories spread of a copycat monolith sighting in the hills of Romania.
All of this leaves us not an iota closer to solving the mystery of the Utah sculpture.
On the plus side, the monolith that captivated the country over the past week, then disappeared as quickly as it entered public consciousness, continues to provide a pleasant sensation of uncertainty. Would it lose its aura and power if we knew who had created it?

WASHINGTON — Soon after Cecilia Rouse finished her first stint as a White House economic adviser, in the administration of President Bill Clinton, a prestigious academic journal published what would arguably become her most famous research paper: a study finding sexism in auditions and hiring for symphony orchestras.
To complete that study, Rouse and a co-author, Claudia Goldin of Harvard, conducted years of research. They worked with orchestra managers and unions to unearth records of auditions dating back decades. “We traveled from city to city,” Goldin recalled, “rummaged through dusty boxes and copied hundreds of entries from yellowing pieces of paper.”
The effort reflected both a focus on the forces that hold people back in the economy and a degree of diligence in her research that Rouse’s colleagues call trademarks of her second stint in the White House, when President Barack Obama tapped her to join his Council of Economic Advisers.
And it is what friends and former colleagues say they expect Rouse to bring to the council if she is confirmed by the Senate to lead it under President-elect Joe Biden, a job that Biden said Tuesday he would restore to Cabinet-level status after it was demoted under President Donald Trump.
Rouse, who received her bachelor’s degree and doctorate in economics from Harvard, is the dean of the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. She emphasized her interest in workers, and what hurts them and holds them back, at an introductory event Tuesday with Biden and other nominees for economic posts in his administration. She said her mother, a school psychologist, had encouraged her to take an economics course as a freshman in college, which came during a national spike in unemployment.
“It was impossible to separate what we were learning in the classroom from what I knew was going on in towns across the country,” Rouse said, “and I found myself drawn to study the labor market in all of its dimensions — the reasons that jobs disappear, the impact of education on people’s job prospects, the ways we can tear down barriers to job growth and make it easier for people to find long-lasting economic security.”
Rouse will be a pioneer if confirmed — the first Black chair of the council. And she will take her position during a sagging recovery from a pandemic recession, at a time when millions of Americans have been out of work for months since the virus first surged through the United States.
Austan Goolsbee, who led the council under Obama when Rouse was a member, said he expected Rouse to focus on challenges facing workers in the so-called gig economy — like drivers for ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft — and on workers who suffer long spells of unemployment in the crisis.
In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Goolsbee said, “she was way ahead of everyone on the issues of the long-term unemployed. From the second the thing began, she was saying, we’re going to have to think about the long-term unemployed and how to get them out of unemployment.”
Along with her symphony paper — which found women were substantially more likely to be hired for orchestras when participating in a “blind” audition with their gender concealed — Rouse’s research has included work on school performance, educational vouchers and diversity in the economics profession. Goldin called her “a leading expert on core labor market issues as well as those in the field of education.”
Goolsbee said he would have not been surprised if Biden had chosen Rouse to lead the Education Department, instead of the CEA. But at the council, he said, he expected Rouse to employ a collaborative management style, in the model of another Princeton economist who went to work in government: Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chair.
In recent months, Rouse has advocated new federal protections for workers in response to the pandemic. In April she called for a law “that mandates (and perhaps subsidizes) paid sick leave, which has been shown to reduce turnover, increase productivity and lower overall health care costs for employers.”
At her introduction in Delaware, she called the pandemic a “devastating crisis” but also “an opportunity to build a better economy in its wake — an economy that works for everyone, brings fulfilling job opportunities and leaves no one to fall through the cracks.”

The Best-Kept Fashion Secret of ‘The Crown’

Ever since “The Crown,” Season 4, bowed on Netflix, the stylesphere has been filled with strange declarations of desire for the pie-crust collars, novelty sweaters, puffed-sleeve floral frocks and 1980s power jackets immortalized by Princess Diana as she ascended to stardom and Princess Anne as she issued caustic asides. Followed pretty much immediately by queries on how to “get the look.”
Such fantasies are rarely easy to fulfill, involving, as they would, time travel — or at least fruitless searching through the pages of Vogues British or American and the social media posts of influencers. But this time around there is actually an answer.
It lies in a house in Fitzroy Square in central London, where Chiara Menage, an elegant 54-year-old former film producer, runs an online vintage clothing store from her kitchen table: Menage Modern Vintage. She is the only employee, and until Amy Roberts, the costume designer for “The Crown,” discovered her trove of 1970s, ’80s and ’90s garments, she was pretty much an undiscovered treasure. (She still only has around 1,800 followers on Instagram.)
But the Peter Pan-collared floral Liberty print dress Diana wears when Prince Charles issues his ill-fated marriage proposal? Menage Modern Vintage. The pale yellow puff-sleeve midi-skirt suit Diana wears for her lunch meeting with Camilla? Hardy Amies from Menage Modern Vintage. The red power suit Diana wears on the way to the Christmas finale? Valentino, Menage Modern Vintage.
All of which means the shop and its founder are about to get thrust into the royal spotlight. In the meantime, Chiara Menage agreed to tiptoe out of the shadows to reveal some of her secrets over Zoom.
Q: How did you become the ultimate royal fashion resource?
A: I spent 20 years working in independent movies and then had three boys, took some time and wanted a change. I’d always loved clothes, but I haven’t bought anything new since about 2000. I live near Marylebone, which is a quite rich area, and I started shopping in charity shops and discovered people were throwing away beautiful Givenchy outfits that I’d never be able to afford to buy new.
I think it’s much easier to find a piece you love by accident than to go into a shop like Selfridges with a list. If you go into a charity shop, something just jumps out at you and insists you have it. Later I got much more interested in the sustainability side of things. I just don’t understand why you would ever buy anything new. Underwear aside.
So I had accumulated a lot. Then about two years ago a friend’s daughter said, “Why not set up a website?” My friends also said they had loads of clothes they didn’t know what to do with, and I thought, “Why not?” I just blithely set it up. I had no idea what I was doing.
Q: What is “modern vintage”?
A: Vintage is officially anything over 20 years old. The millennium is a useful bench mark. Now a lot of people try to cash in on the word and say “vintage” in a listing when it’s clearly not.
I started with a rainbow-sequined catsuit by Rifat Ozbek, one of only two ever made — the other belonging to Grace Jones — that was given to me after a shoot for one of his videos. I did a lot of partying in that suit, but it had been gathering dust in the attic. It was one of the first things I sold, to a collector, and it gave me the money to create a small studio in my basement with a borrowed camera and other things I needed for the business. It also taught me a lot about letting go. This business is not going to make me rich, but I have met a lot of interesting people because of it.
Q: Like who?
A: I had a client who was a princess. I met Sandy Powell, the costume designer, during lockdown because she was home for the first time in ages. She had a big clear-out and gave me 60 pieces, so we decided to sell everything to benefit Refuge, the charity, because we both felt we had been very lucky, all things considered.
I met a young woman on a Photoshop course who said, “My granny’s gone, will you help me clear out her clothes?” Then she took me to her granny’s home, which turned out to be a stately home in the country with a whole floor of clothes from the 1950s. A lot ended up in “The Crown.” Now the young woman sends me messages saying how amazed she is her granny’s stuff is being worn by Princess Anne.
Q: Speaking of “The Crown,” how did that happen?
A: Through a mutual friend, who brought in Amy Roberts, the costume designer. I had just taken on five huge storage units of clothes, sight unseen. They were from a woman, an heiress, who had died and been a complete shopaholic and hoarder. She would stay in a hotel, do a load of shopping at places like Balenciaga and Hermès, nick all the hotel toiletries and then buy a Louis Vuitton suitcase to put everything in. It took months to go through it all.
We found some suitcases full of 12-year-old smoked salmon. Bills from the Dorchester for 14 million pounds. The clothes were pristine. Most hadn’t been worn. So Amy came to have a look and then said she was going to set aside a whole day to come back with her assistant, who is also her daughter. She ended up coming three times and took between 80 and 100 pieces.
Q: Are there pieces in the show you think are particularly special?
A: There are loads I love! I just did a post about a floral silk two-piece pajama set by Ungaro. “The Crown” put it on someone in Mustique. I thought, “I really want it back,” but I don’t have the lifestyle, and it didn’t fit. There was a suit made by Arabella Pollen that was big white and green stripes, and I was really glad because Arabella used to make clothes for Princess Diana, and that one really said it all.
The red Valentino suit Diana wears I had actually sold to someone in Italy and hadn’t shipped yet, and then Amy saw it, and I had to call the buyer up and ask if we could keep it after all. It’s lovely seeing the pieces being worn in actual scenes.
Q: Any tips on what is coming?
A: A friend of mine recently told me about being invited to a 21st birthday party at Windsor Castle in the early ’80s. She borrowed a dress from her sister — Bellville Sassoon, black velvet, backless with boned bodice and huge skirt. It turned out to be identical to the one Diana was wearing at the party.
The next day the tabloids went crazy with the headline “Mystery Blonde Upstages Diana” and camped outside her house for a couple of weeks after bribing a dastardly Etonian to reveal her identity. They offered her the princely sum of 1,000 pounds to pose in the dress getting into a taxi at night, which she refused. She is digging out the dress and the press cuttings from the attic, and I hope to offer it soon.

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
WASHINGTON — The fierce and preemptive Republican pushback against President-elect Joe Biden’s choice of Neera Tanden this week to head the White House budget office underscored the difficulties the incoming administration will face in maneuvering its nominees through a polarized Senate.
In the 11 years since Biden served in the chamber, partisanship has intensified, and nominations — once an area dominated by courtesy, comity and a presumption of accommodation — have become just another brutal battlefield.
Republicans will not be eager to accede to Biden’s choices if they can find reason for opposition. And disparaging comments about Republicans on Twitter from Tanden, a longtime Democratic policy adviser and head of a liberal think tank, were enough for many Republicans to threaten the nomination well before it was made official Tuesday.
“Trumpism has infected the entire Republican caucus,” said James P. Manley, a former longtime top Senate Democratic aide, who urged the incoming administration to brace for intense opposition from Republicans led by Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. “I am not sure everyone has figured out yet what is going on here, but I hope they will soon, and prepare for what is coming.”
Should Democrats win two Senate seats in runoff elections to be held Jan. 5 in Georgia, the party would control the agenda and make approval of Biden’s nominees much easier. But if Democrats fail, Republicans will have the power to decide the fate of Biden’s executive and judicial branch picks.
The reality of a Democratic White House and a Republican Senate will take some adjusting to on Capitol Hill after four years of Republicans working hand-in-hand with President Donald Trump on nominations.
Republicans said they were stunned by the selection of Tanden, whom many knew mainly as a hostile social media presence, to head the Office of Management and Budget. Even though many Republicans have refused to recognize Biden as the winner of the election, they said they were surprised that his team had not checked in with them on how they might react to her nomination to an agency that lawmakers in both parties see as critical when it comes to advancing congressional priorities.
“That was just an unforced error,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said Tuesday. He said that moving forward in future cases without weighing Republican sentiment was “a roll of the dice” that could cause unnecessary embarrassment to a nominee or to Biden’s White House.
Initially, Republicans — who had refused to hold hearings for President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee in 2016 — suggested that they might not even take up Tanden’s nomination were it sent to the Senate. But Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is poised to be the top Republican on one of the two committees that would oversee hearings for Tanden, said he believed she should receive one even if he was skeptical about her chances of confirmation.
“That’s our responsibility,” said Portman, who oversaw the budget office under President George W. Bush. “But it doesn’t mean she’ll get the votes.”
The handling of the announcement of Tanden’s nomination left some in both parties wondering whether Biden’s team was misreading the environment on Capitol Hill, where voting against an administration’s nominees has become essentially the default position for senators in the party out of power in recent years.
But people close to the transition team said opposition to Tanden’s nomination from some Republicans was no surprise to the president-elect or his team, nor was it evidence that Biden, who served almost four decades in the Senate, was naïve about what it would take to win confirmation of his choices. One person familiar with the deliberations said they expected as much from Republicans already angling to run for president in four years.
Advisers said Biden was cleareyed about the need to use some of his political capital to fight for Tanden’s nomination, citing her years of policymaking experience and a compelling personal story as reasons to fight to get her confirmed.
They noted that the reaction from Republicans to Biden’s other nominees has been more muted, with some Republicans suggesting they would be willing to give the president-elect deference in terms of who he wants in his Cabinet. One person close to the nomination process said that Biden and his team had, in fact, been reaching out to Republican lawmakers in recent weeks.
Transition officials said the crisis situation in the nation makes quick confirmation imperative.
“The country is facing multiple crises, from a pandemic that is killing over 10,000 Americans a week to a recession that is continuing to push thousands out of the workforce,” said Andrew Bates, a transition spokesman. “The American people cannot afford partisan obstruction of qualified and experienced women who are nominees.”
Democrats scoffed at the criticisms surrounding Tanden’s selection, particularly over her Twitter feed — given that most Senate Republicans have diligently spent four years evading queries about the array of policy announcements, racist commentary and inflammatory attacks on their own colleagues from Trump on Twitter.
“After spending four years pretending that they didn’t see the latest insane tweet from President Trump, Senate Republicans seem to have found a newfound interest in the Twitter feeds of President-elect Biden’s Cabinet selection,” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor. “A few critical tweets about substantive policy positions have caused Senate Republicans to label Ms. Tanden’s nomination ‘radioactive.’ Spare us the hyperbole.”
Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he believed that Biden and his team should reach out to Capitol Hill about the looming nominations. He added that he had been in touch with some of the intended nominees about scheduling private, one-on-one meetings. (On Tuesday, Schumer’s office circulated photographs of him in a video conference with Biden’s choices for secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, and director of national intelligence, Avril D. Haines.)
“That’s probably the most important first thing because there’s nothing like making your case for yourself,” Kaine said. “Four years ago, President Trump put some nominees up — if they said things in tweets or whatever that we didn’t like, we’d ask them tough questions about that, so she will expect the same.”
Democrats also said they were astounded by calls from Republicans for extensive disclosures of business dealings from Biden’s potential picks after the record compiled by Trump.
“This is just stunning, even by the double standards of Washington,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who labeled the Trump administration “the Babe Ruth of darkness.”
“The Trump administration has stonewalled on so many things — starting with the president’s taxes — and then they come in and the first thing they’re doing is saying, ‘Oh, my goodness, there’s no transparency in the Biden administration,’” he added.
Manley, the former Senate aide, urged Democrats to stand behind the new administration’s nominees or face an onslaught of obstruction from emboldened Republicans.
“If Republicans have objections to her policy views, they should give her a hearing and grill her,” he said. “But the idea that they are prepared to block her nomination because she was mean to them on Twitter is ridiculous, and no Democrat should fall for it.”

Baja en clientes de salones de uñas empuja a la pobreza a trabajadoras inmigrantes

Texto completo: Tras el cierre masivo en marzo, a los salones de manicura en toda la ciudad de Nueva York les ha costado mucho recuperarse.
Hubo un rápido aumento en la demanda después de que se levantó el bloqueo en julio, pero luego las citas comenzaron a disminuir. Ahora, muchas de esas empresas están en el punto de quiebre, un golpe drástico en negocios que son un motor financiero para mujeres inmigrantes.
Algunos salones de manicura han tenido dificultades para persuadir a los clientes de que son seguros para que regresen. Otros, particularmente los ubicados en los distritos empresariales de Manhattan , no han visto a los clientes comunes volver porque huyeron de la ciudad y/o están trabajando desde su casa.
Con 26 años de experiencia en salones de belleza y dos décadas de ahorros financieros invertidos en su empresa personal, Juyoung Lee (53) apenas se mantiene a flote en “Beverly Nail Studio”, el salón que posee en Flushing, Queens.
“A pesar de que antes era laborioso, siempre podía hacer los pagos. Pero ahora, independientemente de lo laborioso que trabaje, no gano dinero”, afirmó a The New York Times.
Las visitas a los salones de manicura dentro del estado se han reducido en más del 50%, y las ventas brutas han caído en más del 40%, de acuerdo con una encuesta de octubre de 161 propietarios de salones realizada por la Federación de la Industria de Uñas de Nueva York (NIFNY).
La Asociación de Trabajadores de Salones de Uñas de Nueva York (NYNSWA), un grupo de defensa afiliado al sindicato Workers United, dijo que menos de la mitad de los 594 empleados encuestados habían regresado al trabajo en agosto. En la ciudad de Nueva York, había 4,240 salones de uñas en 2016, de acuerdo con la Oficina del Censo: 3% de los salones de manicura de todo el país están en Brooklyn y 2% en Queens.
“La presión laboral es principalmente el personal inmigrante que vive al día, apoyando a los niños y, en muchos casos, a los miembros enfermos y ancianos de la familia en sus propias naciones”, comentó Luis Gómez, director de la afiliación. “Agregue la recesión y las consecuencias de la pandemia en el mejor momento, y anticipamos que muchos empleados caerán aún más en la pobreza”.
Los salones fueron autorizados para reabrir en julio con una capacidad del 50% y atendiendo con cita previa. Según el Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director de belleza y análisis científico del Hospital Mount Sinai en Manhattan, si todo el mundo usa máscaras y los clientes se distancian socialmente correctamente, están “considerablemente más seguros que comiendo” en un restaurante.
Pero muchos líderes empresariales temen que los salones no sean capaces de volver a ganar la plena confianza de los clientes hasta que una vacuna se utilice ampliamente.
El 81% del personal en los salones de manicura a nivel nacional son mujeres jóvenes, y 79% son nacidas en el extranjero, de acuerdo con un informe de 2018 realizado por UCLA Labor Center, en California.
“Hay un subconjunto de mujeres que han estado en el negocio de los salones de manicura durante muchos años, pase lo que pase”, afirmó Prarthana Gurung, supervisora ​​de campañas en Adhikaar, un centro de trabajo nepalí que asiste a casi 1,300 empleados de salones en la ciudad de Nueva York.
Hannah Lee, de 60 años, llegó de Corea del Sur, trabajó por años Queens y Manhattan y ahorró lo suficiente para colocar a su hijo en la universidad y pagar el alquiler a tiempo. Ahora recibe sólo unas pocas propinas, por lo general nada en absoluto. Su salario se desplomó de $1 mil dólares por semana a $300. Está atrasada en el contrato de arrendamiento y apenas es capaz de pagar su comida, afirmó.
En Jackson Heights (Queens), la mexicana Mariwvey Ramírez (38), madre soltera, volvió a trabajar no hace mucho después de haber sido suspendida por segunda vez en el salón de Rego Park donde trabajaba, debido a los cierres del vecindario.
Por ser indocumentada no es elegible para cobrar desempleo. Ahora está empleada sólo medio tiempo y su salario pasó de $700 dólares por semana a $400.
El único lado positivo ha sido que ahora que tiene tiempo libre, se ha inscrito para estudiar inglés, en parte para ampliar sus alternativas laborales, pero en gran medida para avanzar en el negocio de los salones de belleza tan pronto como la pandemia disminuya.


Nail salons in New York City have seen a steep decline in customers since reopening in July. Many are now on the verge of collapse — a drastic hit for an industry that is a lifeline for immigrant women. https://t.co/Ai7oIYR685

The Music of More: A Young Pianist Plays a Modern Master

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
Political-protest traditions have shaped the career of composer and pianist Frederic Rzewski over the last half-century. This streak in his art is clear in works like his 1975 classic, “The People United Will Never Be Defeated,” an hourlong set of variations on that Chilean workers’ anthem.
But another aspect of Rzewski’s activist spirit is more, well, administrative. He has long allowed his scores to be distributed freely, including online. (While they are free to download and learn, the composer-granted license does restrict public performance rights.)
This progressive approach to intellectual property has, along with his simultaneously brainy and passionate music, endeared Rzewski to a younger generation of pianists. That includes Thomas Kotcheff, 32, who released the first commercial recording of Rzewski’s 2016 set of piano pieces, “Songs of Insurrection,” in November on the Coviello imprint. The album emerged with Rzewski’s permission but also his aesthetic blessing. The promotional materials include testimonials from him: “It’s superb” and “I love your improvisations!”
Kotcheff handles the piece’s globe-spanning allusions — this time, Rzewski has adapted resistance tunes from Germany, Russia, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Korea and the United States — with flair. The album deserves a place next to this composer’s own authoritative recordings of his music.
In a recent interview by phone from his home in Los Angeles, Kotcheff described the challenges of “Songs of Insurrection,” including Rzewski’s instructions to pianists about their improvisation choices. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: What piece of Rzewski’s turned you into a devotee? What about his music has stood out, to you, over time?
A: At the Peabody Institute, where I went to undergrad, I heard “The People United” performed. And I couldn’t believe it. I thought, “I want to play some of this composer on my senior recital.” I went out and started searching, and I found this piece “Mayn Yingele.” Amazing variations. And when I played it, I felt an instant connection to Rzewski. I think improvisation was my gateway in. Because I love to improvise; it’s been part of my compositional process from the beginning.
Q: How did improvisation inform that recital performance?
A: I remember, at the end, each measure has a fermata [pause]. He says, “The fermata that comes next should be longer than the previous one,” through the entire last section. When I sent him my recording, he replied, “Fantastic performance, but at the very end, that last fermata, you should hold it for as long as physically and mentally possible, and do it for a little longer.”
So for me, when I listen to Rzewski’s music, I just always feel that sense of more . Like, you do everything you can, and that’s still not enough. There needs to be more.
Q: One place where it sounds like you’re giving your all on this new recording is during the third movement, “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around,” a spiritual that later became a civil rights anthem. The second half of the track includes one of your longest improvisations of the album, right?
A: Yes, it lasts for about five minutes. On the opening pages, the score says you shouldn’t predecide to take improvisation or not. But with that third movement specifically, it’s the only one where he indicates there’s an optional improvisation on the theme. Which to me spoke to the kind of American sound of it.
The blues sound is in there, the hymnal sound. And that really stood out to me as an interpreter of the piece. Then I started thinking about the larger framework of the piece; I really see the first three movements as being its own little set. It felt right that the third one would be the pinnacle.
If you see other recordings that are out there, online, of this piece, by either Rzewski or another pianist named Bobby Mitchell, they get to the third movement improvisation and they just do, like, a bar. Then they go on. So my five-minute thing is a real decision. But to me, there’s no other version of that piece that could exist in my mind. Probably against Rzewski’s instruction, I do it that way almost every time, with that kind of gesture of density.
Q: I noticed that, since the improv section on the recording is broadly similar to your livestreamed take during a recent album-release concert. It sounds like, no matter how dizzyingly dense the rest of it is, your patiently doled out, low-register motifs are imperturbable. Is this a musical depiction of marching?
A: I think you really heard the piece the way I heard it, too. When he presents the theme, at the beginning of the movement, he presents it with a descending, chromatic bass line. In my mind, he presents it as a passacaglia, in a way. And so that is where my mind went to. Like you said, it just continues on, it keeps going and going, until I have nothing left to give the piano. I’m just spent.
Q: What are some other highlights?
A: I really like the second movement, the “Katyusha,” from Russia. The way, in the opening, that the theme is presented with this chorale. And in the middle of the piece, he just goes straight up tonal, all of a sudden. It affects me; I really like it. It’s strong and passionate.
You can also just kind of get lost in the weeds in the big, entire piece. It has this fantasia quality: spinning and going and changing gears and moving on. You look at the fourth movement — Ireland’s “Foggy Dew” — and it’s changing fast. And the sixth, too: “Los Cuatro Generales,” from Spain. The sixth and fourth are so hard: Every two measures, we’re somewhere different. We’re moving.
Q: What do you gain by listening to this composer play his music — either this piece, or past ones?
A: I actually get so empowered by watching him play, because he interprets his music like crazy. He will add accelerandos, add ritardandos; he will change things in his own piece. And when I hear that, it also empowers me. Because I go, there’s nothing on this bar that says to do what he just did, but he’s doing it. So he’s giving, in my mind, the other performers carte blanche to make that bar their own.

Texto completo: DETROIT – U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence officer who worked for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was mentioned in a media report as being among those under consideration to become President-elect Joe Biden's CIA director.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, won election to her second two-year term representing Michigan's 8th Congressional District on Nov.3. The district is comprised of Ingham and Livingston counties and northern Oakland County.
On Friday, the New York Times mentioned Slotkin among those under consideration to take over the Central Intelligence Agency. Others mentioned included Michael Morell, who served as acting CIA director under Obama; former national security adviser Thomas Donilon, and Sue Gordon, who had served as deputy director of national intelligence. Slotkin did three tours in Iraq as a CIA officer and went on to work in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. She was the only Iraq adviser held over from the Bush administration when Obama took office in 2009 and later became acting assistant secretary at the Pentagon.
Asked about the speculation on Saturday, Slotkin's spokeswoman, Hannah Lindow, told the Free Press, "While Congresswoman Slotkin appreciates being named alongside such qualified candidates to lead the CIA, she is honored to serve the people of Michigan's 8th District, and looks forward to doing so for a second term in Congress."
Slotkin is not the only Michigander being talked about as having a potential role in the Biden administration. Democratic U.S. Rep. Andy Levin of -Bloomfield Township has the support of some union leaders, including those in the UAW, to take over as secretary of the Department of Labor. The New York Times article also mentioned Gene Sperling, who worked as national economic adviser to Obama and former President Bill Clinton and is from Ann Arbor, as taking on a similar role for Biden.

Why the Pandemic Has Made Streets More Dangerous for Blind People

NEW YORK — For pedestrians who cannot see or have limited vision, navigating the chaotic sidewalks and crosswalks of New York City was dicey enough before the pandemic. But the outbreak, blind people say, has made crossing the city’s streets even riskier and more harrowing.
It has reduced the flow of cars and trucks at times, leaving streets in some neighborhoods as placid as suburban lanes. That may sound like a blessing for blind New Yorkers like Terence Page.
But, in fact, the opposite is true. The normal roar of traffic moving past provides clues — often the only ones — about when it is time to venture into a crosswalk.
“Quiet is not good for blind people,” Page said as he swept his long green cane across the sidewalk along Sixth Avenue in Manhattan, trying to locate the curb at West 23rd Street.
But Page had just traversed the avenue with confidence because that crossing is equipped with an audible signal that tells pedestrians when they have the go-ahead to stride across the pavement. The vast majority of the city’s 13,200 crossings are not, including the one at 23rd Street that Page faced after crossing Sixth Avenue.
As a result, a federal judge has found that the city has failed to fully protect some of its most vulnerable residents.
The judge ruled in October that the “near-total absence” of those devices — known as Accessible Pedestrian Signals — violated the civil rights of blind people by denying them equal access to the city’s crosswalks.
Blind New Yorkers “must risk being hit by cars and bicycles and becoming stranded in the middle of intersections,” wrote the judge, Paul A. Engelmayer of U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Page, 6 feet and sturdy, knows well what the judge was describing. Standing at the northeast corner of the normally busy intersection, Page hesitated. Without an audible device, blind pedestrians like him have to guess when they have the light.
“I know I am taking my life in my hands,” Page said, as he prepared to step off the curb half a block from his home.
The court ordered the city to negotiate with the group that filed the suit, the American Council of the Blind of New York, on a remedy for the lack of audible signals. That decision was welcomed by Page and advocates for the blind who have been pressing city officials for years to address the issue.
“We are thrilled with the dramatic changes that this victory will mean not only for those who are blind or low vision, but for all New Yorkers who want safer streets,” said Torie Atkinson, a staff attorney at Disability Rights Advocates, which represented the plaintiffs in a class-action suit filed in 2018.
City officials declined to explain why audible signals have been installed at less than 5% of the city’s intersections that have traffic signals.
Instead, Mitch Schwartz, a spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, issued a statement saying, “The city is dedicated to making our streets more accessible to all New Yorkers with and without disabilities, including those are who are blind or have low vision.” He added that the Department of Transportation plans to continue to install audible signals across the city.
Since 2014, the city has had a Vision Zero policy to reduce pedestrian fatalities, which has included redesigns of intersections and signals. But advocates argue that some of those changes have actually made matters worse for the blind.
At some intersections, the Department of Transportation has implemented “leading pedestrian intervals,” which give walkers a head start of several seconds before the light turns green for the parallel traffic.
But Lori Sharff, former president of the American Council of the Blind of New York, said that does not help them because they rely on traffic noise for cues. Without the roar of engines in motion, they are left standing at the curb while sighted people rush across the street, Scharff said.
When in doubt, they often can rely on other pedestrians to offer guidance or an elbow to clasp. But in the grip of COVID-19, fellow travelers are less inclined to get so close, Page said.
“There are less people who want to help you or even touch you,” he explained. “Since COVID has happened, a lot of the things that blind people need are not there.”
To make matters more challenging, the sidewalks and streets are filled with new obstacles: dining tables surrounded by makeshift fences and tents.
As Page ambled up Seventh Avenue, his face smacked into an umbrella emblazoned with a Campari logo that protruded into his path.
The midday journey around Page’s Chelsea neighborhood revealed just how hazardous things would be for blind pedestrians in New York even if intersections were equipped with audible signals. But there a fewer than 700 of those beeping devices across the city.
“When I hear an APS, I feel safe,” Page said.
In a four-block loop from his building on the north side of 23rd Street, Page encountered a variety of hazards, including scaffolding, police barricades, sandwich boards promoting businesses, workmen sprawled on the sidewalk eating lunch and open stairways to the subway.
He took all those in stride, locating them with his ball-tipped cane — “Jets green” for his favorite football team — before they caused him any harm. But the stop-and-go traffic of cars, trucks, buses and bicycles was a different matter.
When he returned to Sixth Avenue and crossed at 22nd Street without the aid of an audible signal, Page paused to catch his breath and admitted how anxious that made him. He said he usually depended on strangers for guidance, though he would rather not.
He said people frequently take hold of his arm, meaning to be helpful. But he has to explain that he would rather take hold of theirs so that they can guide him.
Right on cue, a young woman gripped Page’s elbow and offered to help him across 23rd Street at Seventh Avenue. He switched to holding her arm and chatted with her as they crossed, even though he had the aid of an audible signal there.
The woman, Yolanda Yona, an interior designer and model from Zimbabwe, said she had noticed the beeping that emanated from yellow devices on each corner. “I just like helping people I guess,” she said, adding that she was undeterred by the pandemic.
Even a few audible signals would be a godsend for Myrna Votta, who has had to negotiate the streets of Brooklyn Heights without them for more than 40 years. Votta, 81, made use of audible signals in Manhattan when she taught music at the 59th Street headquarters of the charitable organization for the visually impaired known as the Lighthouse.
She occasionally encounters an audible signal when she takes her guide dog, a yellow Labrador retriever, to the veterinarians at the Animal Medical Center on the Upper East Side.
“They really are very helpful,” Votta said, especially at intersections where it otherwise would be easy to find yourself and your guide dog headed in the wrong direction. “You’ve got to be lined up the right way,” she explained. “If you’re facing diagonally, the dog’s going to take you that way.”
Votta said she and her husband Pat, who is also blind but uses a cane, go out of their way to reach certain places in the neighborhood, including a favorite diner, because some intersections are just too dangerous. She said she hoped the court’s ruling would force the city to install more audible signals soon in Brooklyn Heights and throughout the city.
“The whole deal for me is let’s make the playing field even,” Votta said. “If you can see, you’ve got a much better chance of not getting killed than I have.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
NEW YORK — A new restaurant showed up in October on Third Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, announcing its arrival right in the sidewalk, where a tracery of Arabic script meaning “end the occupation” and a peace sign are imprinted in concrete. Above the street wall — a grid of windows that slides open in good weather — the restaurant’s mission is written in swooshes of red, green and black spray paint: “Shawarma. Falafel. Palestinian Street Food.”
Ayat is all that and more. Orders to stay or to go are taken at the end of a long glass counter, behind which are displayed trays of whipped hummus, tightly rolled grape leaves, muhammara the consistency of peanut butter from the health food store, taboulleh minced so finely it might have been cut with scalpels, and a dozen other mezze and salads.
In the background are two slowly turning towers of meat, one chicken and the other beef, getting darker and more distractingly aromatic until an order comes in, and the dark patches are clipped off and drop like wool shorn from a sheep.
All in all, it is a standard falafel-and-shawarma setup except for one thing, the steel dome next to the front window that looks like a big upside-down wok. Its hot, convex surface is a griddle that cooks a crepe-thin flatbread that is essential to many Palestinian dishes, Palestinian meals and this exceptional Palestinian restaurant. The griddle is known as a saj. At Ayat, the bread is also called saj, although it goes by other names as well, like markouk.
Saj is the bread that you will be given for swishing around in roughly pounded baba ghanouj. Saj swaddles your sandwich of grilled beef kebab.
And saj makes the first layer of Ayat’s mansaf, where it is sprinkled with cinnamon and cardamom and spread across the bottom of a glazed red-clay dish under an inch or so of yellow rice. Embedded in this starch-on-starch foundation are several great hunks of lamb stewed with a white powder shaved from rock-hard stones of dried yogurt called jameed. The stew produces very tender meat, along with an intense emulsion of rendered fat, lamb juices and reconstituted yogurt that is served in a separate bowl. This emulsion is a bit like hot lamb mayonnaise, intoxicating in its way, but rich enough to make you grateful for the crunch provided by the toasted almond slivers that have been freely distributed over the mansaf’s surface.
A taller, more cushiony wheel of bread, this one baked in an oven, serves as an edible plate in Ayat’s version of mussakhan, a signature of West Bank and Jordanian cooking. The bread, called taboon, is covered with browned onions, pine nuts and roasted chicken dusted with ground sumac; it sits there, soaking up juices from the chicken and the onions, until you eat it.
Bread is key to all good fattoush, but especially to Ayat’s, made with shards of pita that are translucently thin, crisp as potato chips and virtually purple with ground sumac. The sumac’s tartness is picked up and amplified by the lemon-juice-and-pomegranate molasses vinaigrette that dresses chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, romaine and mint.
Manaqish are the most pizzalike breads at Ayat, baked in an oven until tender and puffy around the rim. You can have one spread with spiced ground beef, or one with olive oil and za’atar, or you can get the Arabic version of what the local pizzerias would call a white slice, with mozzarella and crumbled akkawi cheese that melt around sesame seeds and nigella.
Ayat is owned by Abdul Elenani and his wife, Ayat Masoud. He is a construction contractor and an entrepreneur who apparently likes to keep active. In addition to the new restaurant, he owns three Cocoa Grinder coffee shops; Falahi Farms, a grocery store with a halal butcher and deep portfolios of dates, olives and other Middle Eastern ingredients; and a Belgian fry shop called Fritebar.
When the two are not tending to business on Third Avenue, they are at home on Staten Island, where they sometimes keep a 13-year-old mare, Morgie, in a stable they built at the end of their driveway.
Their new restaurant is named for Masoud, a lawyer who was born in Brooklyn to parents who immigrated from Jerusalem. She is responsible for all the recipes and all the cooking except the shawarma and the markouk. Her view of Palestinian cuisine is informed by her family’s traditions, which overlap with those of cooks from the West Bank, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria. Although the recipes enjoyed by Palestinian families like Masoud’s may have been passed down for many generations, the notion of a Palestinian cuisine is a relatively recent one.
In the United States, it is easier to read about Palestinian food in cookbooks written by Yasmin Khan, Reem Kassis and Sami Tamimi than to find a restaurant that regularly serves it. Complicating the hunt is the large number of dishes that Palestinian cooks share with others throughout the Middle East, their templates the same from Gaza to Aleppo even when their individual recipes — a spice that is always used here but is usually omitted somewhere else — may contain information that ties them to a specific village as precisely as a set of GPS coordinates.
To my palate, at least, there is little to set apart Ayat’s kebabs and shawarmas, although they do suggest that Elenani has very good sources of meat. (The beef, lamb and chicken at the restaurant come from the same farmers who supply Falahi Farms.) Nor is there anything unusual about the falafel, which has a lively crunch but is somewhat more compact and less aromatic than some other local purveyors’.
The dishes from the Palestinian home-cooking canon, though, are usually prepared with painstaking care. Persian squash are hollowed out as carefully as if they were going to be made into tiny stringed instruments instead of being stuffed with rice and onions. Sticks of lamb kefta, improbably delicate, are baked with peppers, onions and potatoes in a tahini-thickened lemon sauce so brightly Mediterranean it almost shines.
If you have come at the right hour, you can watch Fatima Fares make the markouk, shaping one disk of dough after another. She presses it out with the flat of her hand, while somehow keeping the frilled ends of her sleeves from becoming part of the bread, then flips the dough onto an inflatable pillow that looks like something your great-aunt might rest her feet on while doing needlepoint.
With pinched fingertips she will tug at the edge of the dough, stretching it into a circle the size of a hubcap, working so quickly that she seems to be merely issuing commands that the dough obeys, like a show dog. She will raise the air cushion above the saj and invert it, letting the dough settle on the hot dome. By the time the bread has cooked on both sides, about a minute later, she already has a fresh circle ready to drop.

In England, Rumbles of Discontent as Parliament Votes to Exit Lockdown

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
LONDON — Much of England will swap lockdown for less stringent coronavirus restrictions, after Parliament approved new rules Tuesday despite a substantial revolt among lawmakers in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party.
The rebellion, by lawmakers who want to go farther in easing the limits on public life, underscored the rising tide of discontent among Johnson’s own members of Parliament over his handling of the pandemic, exacerbated by fears that the curbs could lay waste to large swathes of the hospitality industry.
Caught between the competing demands of this vocal faction of his lawmakers and those of his more cautious scientific advisers, Johnson opted to keep stringent measures in place, including restrictions on many pubs and restaurants.
From Wednesday there will be some relaxation from the lockdown in all areas, as all stores, gyms, and hairdressers will be allowed to reopen. Religious services and weddings can restart, and limited numbers of spectators will be allowed at some outdoor sporting events.
But England will return to a system under which coronavirus restrictions differ from place to place, with areas of the country divided into three “tiers” based on an assessment of the coronavirus risks in each one. That is similar to the framework in place earlier in the year, which failed to prevent a second wave of the pandemic or avert last month’s lockdown.
So this time — and to the anger of many Conservative lawmakers — almost all of England will be in the top two tiers, placing significant restrictions on the hospitality trade in areas where around 55 million people live. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own coronavirus rules.
A large part of England, home to around 23 million people, will be in the strictest tier, where pubs and restaurants will be shut except for takeout service.
In regions placed in the middle tier, including London, pubs will only be able to serve alcohol to customers who order a “substantial meal” — a condition that the government has struggled to explain when asked which types of food qualify.
As well as tripping up ministers, the debate over such loopholes has underscored the extent to which the state is dictating the minutiae of daily life, something that makes libertarian Conservative lawmakers distinctly queasy.
On Tuesday, critics in Parliament included several mainstays of the Conservative establishment like Graham Brady, who chairs an influential group of lawmakers.
“If government is to take away fundamental liberties of the people whom we represent they must illustrate beyond question they are acting in a way that is both proportionate and absolutely necessary,” said Brady, before concluding that the government had “failed to make that compelling case.”
His comments came after Johnson sought to placate critics, arguing that with the arrival of the vaccine on the horizon, “there is an end in sight,” but adding: “we cannot afford to relax, especially during the cold months of winter.”
The outcome of Tuesday’s vote in Parliament, which Johnson won by 291-78 was never in doubt after a decision by the opposition Labour Party to abstain.
Presented with a take-it-or-leave-it offer, Labour’s leader, Keir Starmer, told his lawmakers not to vote, saying he did not want to stop the only set of restrictions available and therefore would not vote against them. He also said he did not want to endorse measures he described as insufficient and likely to fail. Starmer, who has recently ramped up criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic, also called for more financial support for those struggling from the economic fallout.
Surveys generally show that the public supports tough measures to control the spread of the virus and prevent the health service from being overwhelmed, and Johnson’s government is hardly unique in the dilemmas it faces.
After a new rise of infections in Wales, all pubs will be banned from serving alcohol, starting Friday, with the hospitality sector restricted by a 6 p.m. curfew.
Yet the scale of the Conservative revolt served a warning to Johnson, denting the authority of a government whose majority in Parliament looks less than solid only a year after he won a landslide election victory.
More than 50 of the 364 Conservative members of Parliament voted against the new measures Tuesday — the biggest rebellion against Johnson since the election. Last month, 34 Conservative lawmakers voted against the lockdown measures.
Many Conservative lawmakers had demanded an assessment of the economic impact of the new restrictions but were dissatisfied with a subsequent government document that they felt was largely a rehash of material already published.
Aside from those who object to the new rules on libertarian grounds, several Conservative lawmakers disputed decisions to place the areas they represent in tier three of the restrictions, with the most stringent curbs.
The next highest category, tier two, where pubs can reopen but can only serve alcohol alongside a substantial meal, effectively forces bars that do not offer food to close.
But those rules have also prompted a lively debate about whether pubs can serve drinks alongside some less sophisticated British staples, including a Scotch egg — a boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in breadcrumbs and then deep-fried.
Questioned on this topic, one minister, George Eustice, said Monday that the Scotch egg would qualify as a substantial meal. Then on Tuesday, his Cabinet colleague, Michael Gove, referred to it as a starter — rather than a main course — only to appear to contradict himself in another interview and suggest that it passed the pub meal test.
The loophole for pubgoers was seized on by the Sun newspaper, which predicted what many drinkers would order when pubs finally open in tier two areas Wednesday.
“Ten pints of lager … and a Scotch egg please,” read its banner headline.

‘Georgia Is Not New York’: Progressives Adapt Efforts for Senate Runoffs

Neither Jon Ossoff nor the Rev. Raphael Warnock has endorsed the Green New Deal. But that has not stopped the Sunrise Movement, the activist climate group that champions the sweeping climate change plan, from mobilizing in force for the two Georgia Democrats in their high-stakes runoff races for Senate seats.
The group is aiming to help register 10,000 to 20,000 Georgians who will turn 18 by Jan. 5, the day of the elections. It has people on the ground canvassing and dropping off campaign literature. And while its appeals mention the threat from climate change, it does not present the issue as a litmus test.
“Right now, we’re focused on the bigger picture,” said Shanté Wolfe, who is leading the Sunrise Movement’s work in Georgia. “Our effort is in favor of the greater good.”
The furious efforts in Georgia by the Sunrise Movement and other progressive groups — on behalf of two candidates who do not share their most ambitious policy goals — reflect the urgency that is consuming the Democratic Party’s left flank. Two victories in Georgia would produce a 50-50 tie in the Senate, giving Democrats control of the chamber because Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes as vice president.
Without Democratic control, progressive lawmakers, activists and their grassroots supporters worry that they will not be able to achieve even a pared-down version of their policy wish list for the country.
But they also understand that for decades Georgia has been a Republican stronghold with a large number of conservative voters, and their efforts there need to be modulated. President-elect Joe Biden won the state, many Democrats point out, with a moderate agenda that tempered the rhetoric and policy goals of the left. Biden, Warnock and Ossoff do not support “Medicare for All,” another priority of the party’s left wing.
Wolfe said the Sunrise Movement had tried to adjust its messaging for a state like Georgia by “making sure that we localize the Green New Deal in a way that resonates with Southerners.” For instance, canvassers are emphasizing how climate change affects the air that Georgians breathe, she said.
Other groups are also pouring money and resources into the state.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee has raised $386,000 for the two Democratic candidates. MoveOn, a progressive group, hopes to mobilize many of its 250,000 members in Georgia, and more nationwide, to canvass and phone bank in the state. Our Revolution, the political organization that spun out of Bernie Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign, is contacting its 50,000 member households in the state to encourage them to request mail ballots.
“We are moving heaven and earth and pointing all of our resources as much as we can to help us win those two seats in Georgia,” said Jamaal Bowman, a New York Democrat who will be sworn into the next Congress.
Bowman said he spoke recently with Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the Georgia governor’s race in 2018 and is widely credited with voter turnout initiatives that helped flip Georgia blue this year, to see how he could support her efforts. And he said that he and other progressives in the House — including “the Squad,” a now-growing group that began with four congresswomen of color — were strategizing about how to help in Georgia.
“Georgia is not New York. It’s not California. It has its own culture,” Bowman said. “But it’s a culture rooted in justice for all, and we just want to make sure we support that initiative as much as we can, as representatives from other parts of the country.”
Amid deepening ideological fault lines among Democrats over messaging and electoral strategy — divisions that have burst into the open as the party takes stock of its painful losses down the ballot — the two Senate runoff elections will also be a test case for whether progressives can balance their broad calls for change with the realities of campaigning in a once reliably Republican state.
Defeating two Republican incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, will be no easy task for Ossoff and Warnock. Still, the competitiveness of the races, and the progressive focus on Georgia, underscores the political evolution occurring in the state.
Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992. And although Georgia does not have a reputation now as a hotbed of liberalism, some organizers and strategists inside and outside Georgia contend that it is becoming increasingly receptive to left-leaning ideas.
While many of the Democrats who won in Georgia last month were more moderate, including Carolyn Bourdeaux, who flipped a longtime Republican House district in metropolitan Atlanta, several local progressive candidates won farther down the ballot. They include Nicole Love Hendrickson, who became the first Black person elected as commission chair of Gwinnett County, in suburban Atlanta.
Progressives see Georgia not as a one-off endeavor in 2020 but as a top target of their efforts for years to come.
“Is Georgia a Tier 1 state? Is Georgia a progressive state? Are we building a new Georgia? Yes, yes and yes,” said Britney Whaley, a political strategist with the Working Families Party, a progressive group that has been operating in Georgia since 2018 and has endorsed Warnock.
Nse Ufot, chief executive of the New Georgia Project, which was founded by Abrams and has registered hundreds of thousands of new voters, said there was still “an obsession with moving white moderate men back into the Democratic Party.” But that thinking was mistaken, she said, even — and perhaps especially — in Georgia.
“It just feels like people do not get, and do not understand, what it takes to win and what it takes to win in the South,” she said. “We can contribute to this progressive majority — it’s just that it can’t be race-blind. It can’t be race neutral.”
There are plenty of signs that suggest liberals face an uphill battle in Georgia. Sanders, the Vermont senator and progressive standard-bearer, lost Georgia’s Democratic presidential primary to Hillary Clinton by more than 40 percentage points in 2016. (Sanders had dropped out of the race by the time Georgia held its primary in June this year.)
Biden beat President Donald Trump in Georgia by making significant gains among affluent, college-educated and older voters in the suburbs around Atlanta, according to a New York Times Upshot analysis of the results; at the same time, the Black share of the electorate fell to its lowest point since 2006.
Those findings indicate that Democrats must still depend on the support of traditionally conservative voters to win statewide — rather than turning out a progressive majority led by young voters and nonwhite voters.
Even if the Democrats win the two Georgia Senate seats, progressives will face significant barriers to passing their policies. It is unlikely that all 50 Democratic senators would get behind a left-wing policy proposal like expanding the Supreme Court, or that Biden would support it.
Rep. Ro Khanna of California, the first vice chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said the Georgia races were “about the here and now.”
“We understand the stakes, and every progressive group that I know of has made that a priority with the same passion and determination as winning back the presidency,” he said.
But he also said the horizon for the movement was long. Even if Democrats fail to win control of the Senate, he said, progressives should try to pass an agenda in the House that includes less transformative policy goals than "Medicare for All" — including raising the minimum wage, forgiving student loan debt and expanding access to Medicare.
“I don’t think that their outcome should determine the boldness of our agenda,” Khanna said, referring to the Georgia runoffs. “The mistake would be to pull back.”
For the party’s left wing, the potential limits on a progressive agenda have not dampened the resolve.
In a fundraising email last month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hailed Biden’s success as proof that “the path to victory in Georgia is clearer than ever.”
Then she issued a call to arms: “Democrats can win these two Senate races too — and we must.”

Texto completo: Agrande esta imagen.
A few years ago, I walked through Tokyo’s neon-lit streets for the first time, wide-eyed and jet-lagged. It only took three days to learn some of the city’s secrets. If you cannot find the perfect noodle shop for lunch, for example, look up and you will see another dozen options, filling the upper floors of what you thought were office buildings. Or that famous places — like Shibuya Crossing, the intersection you have seen in 100 timelapses — are famous for a reason, but there is so much more to learn by picking a metro stop at random and going for a long walk.
This was supposed to be a big year for tourism for the city — already one of the world’s most visited — as it was set to host the now postponed Olympics and Paralympic Games. That, of course, did not happen.
With most of the world still confined to their homes, that Tokyo trip will have to wait for the millions of people who canceled flights and hotel bookings. In the meantime, there are ways to capture the spirit of a sometimes impenetrable, always fascinating city. Perhaps, just for a night, these recommendations might even make you feel like you are there.
Hear the City
I first met Kazuto Okawa, who performs under the name LLLL, outside a convenience store in the quirky neighborhood of Koenji on my first night in Tokyo. He was sitting on a curb in a circle of friends, his face obscured by long, disheveled hair. Over the years since that first encounter, his music — a blend of sugary pop hooks and space-age soundscapes — has become synonymous with the city for me. If those conflicting feelings of disorientation and joy that hit every visitor to Tokyo could be translated to sound, this would be it.
When I asked Okawa what music best captures his home city, he directed me to the classics. Musician Keigo Oyamada, better known as Cornelius, is sometimes reductively called the “Japanese Beck” for the way he swoops between genres with ease. Every album is a journey, but for the most evocative of the city, Okawa suggests his 1995 album “69/96.” “It’s forever futuristic,” he said. “A perfect match to Tokyo.”
If Cornelius is too out there for you, Okawa recommends “Kazemachi Roman” by Tokyo folk rock pioneers Happy End: You may recognize a song from the soundtrack to that great tribute to Tokyo, “Lost in Translation.”
To begin understanding the phenomenon that is Tokyo’s J-pop scene, Okawa says to start with Sheena Ringo’s “Kabukicho no joou.” “It captures the dark side of the city,” he said. “And it happens to be one of the most popular J-pop songs of all time.” For the flip side of the same pop coin — perhaps it is a more lively summer night you are trying to re-create — he recommends Taeko Ohnuki’s aptly titled “Sunshower.”
Cook at the Dinner Table
No trip to Tokyo is complete without a whole lot of eating. While it may be hard to accurately re-create a bona fide Tokyo bowl of ramen or plate of sushi, there is plenty that you can do from home.
Quick and easy dishes include yakitori (yes, you really can make it at home) and nori chips (perfect with a cold Japanese lager).
For something more involved, and seasonally appropriate, follow the lead of Motoko Rich, The New York Times’ Tokyo bureau chief. “With the weather getting cooler, it’s time to break out the butane burner for shabu shabu, a classic Japanese dinner that you can make and eat right at the table,” she said.
First, make a kombu dashi, a broth flavored with dried kelp, then take beef, tofu, vegetables and mushrooms and dip them into the bubbling liquid, making sure to swirl in the ingredients long enough that they cook through. “Although we can cook shabu shabu at home, it also reminds me of fancier mid-20th-century-era restaurants in Tokyo, where the servers wear kimonos and carry regal platters to the tables.”
Expand Your Literary Horizons
If you want to lose yourself in Tokyo by curling up with a good book, we have plenty of recommendations, whether it is a long work of fiction you are after or more snackable short stories. There is more — a lot more — than Haruki Murakami. Rich recommends “Breasts and Eggs” by Mieko Kawakami. “I love the way Kawakami references real and recognizable, but not exoticized, Tokyo locations,” she said. “You feel in the know, reading it, rather than as if you are being introduced to a precious Other World. It is Tokyo as it is lived in, not a film set.”
See the City on the Screen
If an evening of TV and subtitles is what you are after, start with the binge-worthy “Midnight Diner: Tokyo Stories” on Netflix. The show is about the customers who pass through a tiny counter-service restaurant that is only open from midnight to 6. At turns heartwarming, hilarious and melancholic, it is a moving portrait of Tokyo after dark. If the opening title sequence does not make you feel good, check your pulse: it is ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) for the soul.
When it comes to movies, as Mike Hale, a Times’ television critic, said, “Tokyo is simultaneously the most cosmopolitan and the most intensely local city you can imagine, and that’s a perfect combination for storytelling, as directors from Kurosawa to Kiarostami to Sofia Coppola have shown.”
Where to start then? You cannot skip Akira Kurosawa, the influential filmmaker whose career spanned almost six decades. Hale recommends “Stray Dog” (1949), shot in Tokyo in the aftermath of World War II. He describes it as “a walking tour of the city in sheer survival mode.” Next, try “Tokyo Drifter” (1966) by Seijun Suzuki. “Suzuki’s stylized yakuza story sets traditional themes of honor and corruption against a jazzy, jagged, surrealist distillation of the rapidly changing city,” he said. Finally, for something more contemporary, watch the Cannes Palm d’Or-winning “Shoplifters” (2018) by Hirokazu Kore-eda. In Hale’s view, the film, about a family of grifters, “shows both the glittering modern metropolis and the shadow world just beyond the neon.”
Get Lost in the Virtual World
While Japan’s most internationally famous video gaming figure may be an Italian plumber with a taste for mushrooms, there are also plenty of games more grounded in real-life Tokyo than Super Mario Bros. Brian Ashcraft, an Osaka-based senior writer at gaming website Kotaku, recommends the expansive “Yakuza” series, which follows Kazuma Kiryu as he makes his name in the underworld. The Yakuza games are action-packed, but with dance battles, karaoke sessions and laugh-out-loud dialogue, they are also unabashedly silly. “This year has resulted in all events and trips to Tokyo being canned,” Ashcraft said. “The Yakuza games do a fantastic job of bringing parts of the city to life. These obsessive, digital recreations mimic the idea of Tokyo. For me, that’s good enough.”

Texto completo: DETROIT – U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence officer who worked for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was mentioned in a media report as being among those under consideration to become President-elect Joe Biden's CIA director.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, won election to her second two-year term representing Michigan's 8th Congressional District on Nov.3. The district is comprised of Ingham and Livingston counties and northern Oakland County.
On Friday, the New York Times mentioned Slotkin among those under consideration to take over the Central Intelligence Agency. Others mentioned included Michael Morell, who served as acting CIA director under Obama; former national security adviser Thomas Donilon, and Sue Gordon, who had served as deputy director of national intelligence.
Slotkin did three tours in Iraq as a CIA officer and went on to work in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. She was the only Iraq adviser held over from the Bush administration when Obama took office in 2009 and later became acting assistant secretary at the Pentagon.
Asked about the speculation on Saturday, Slotkin's spokeswoman, Hannah Lindow, told the Free Press, "While Congresswoman Slotkin appreciates being named alongside such qualified candidates to lead the CIA, she is honored to serve the people of Michigan's 8th District, and looks forward to doing so for a second term in Congress."
Slotkin is not the only Michigander being talked about as having a potential role in the Biden administration. Democratic U.S. Rep. Andy Levin of -Bloomfield Township has the support of some union leaders, including those in the UAW, to take over as secretary of the Department of Labor. The New York Times article also mentioned Gene Sperling, who worked as national economic adviser to Obama and former President Bill Clinton and is from Ann Arbor, as taking on a similar role for Biden.

E.P.A.'s Staff Resists a Final Deregulatory Push

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency was rushing to complete one of its last regulatory priorities, aiming to obstruct the creation of air- and water-pollution controls far into the future, when a senior career scientist moved to hobble it.
Thomas Sinks directed the E.P.A.'s science advisory office and later managed the agency's rules and data around research that involved people. Before his retirement in September, he decided to issue a blistering official opinion that the pending rule -- which would require the agency to ignore or downgrade any medical research that does not expose its raw data -- will compromise American public health.
"If this rule were to be finalized it would create chaos," Dr. Sinks said in an interview in which he acknowledged writing the opinion that had been obtained by The New York Times. "I thought this was going to lead to a train crash and that I needed to speak up."
With two months left of the Trump administration, career E.P.A. employees find themselves where they began, in a bureaucratic battle with the agency's political leaders. But now, with the Biden administration on the horizon, they are emboldened to stymie Mr. Trump's goals and to do so more openly.
The filing of a "dissenting scientific opinion" is an unusual move; it signals that Andrew Wheeler, the administrator of the E.P.A., and his politically appointed deputies did not listen to the objections of career scientists in developing the regulation. More critically, by entering the critique as part of the official Trump administration record on the new rule, Dr. Sinks's dissent will offer Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s E.P.A. administrator a powerful weapon to repeal the so-called "secret science" policy.
E.P.A. career employees this month also quietly emailed out the results of a new study concluding that the owners of half a million diesel pickup trucks had illegally removed their emissions control technology, leading to huge increases in air pollution. And some senior E.P.A. staff members have engaged in back-channel conversations with the president-elect's transition team as they waited for Mr. Trump to formally approve the official start of the presidential transition, two agency employees acknowledged.
Current and former E.P.A. staff and advisers close to the transition said Mr. Biden's team has focused on preparing a rapid assault on the Trump administration's deregulatory legacy and re-establishing air and water protections and methane emissions controls.
"They are focused like a laser on what I call the 'Humpty Dumpty approach,' which is putting the agency back together again," said Judith Enck, a former E.P.A. regional administrator who served in the Obama administration.
The transition team is particularly focused on renewing efforts to tackle climate change, which had been crushed by the Trump administration and mocked by Mr. Wheeler as little more than "virtue signaling" to foreign countries. There also are plans to revamp scientific advisory boards that Mr. Wheeler and his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, had stacked with allies of private industry and purged of many academic scientists.
"They seem hyper-focused on what it's going to take to get things back on track," said Chris Zarba, former director of the E.P.A.'s science advisory board, adding, "I think they're going to do a full reset."
Racing against those efforts is Mr. Wheeler, who has a long list of priorities that aides and confidants said he is determined to complete before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. He has also maneuvered legally to erect time-consuming hurdles that Mr. Biden will have to clear to unwind some Trump administration policies.
At the top of Mr. Wheeler's to-do list is finalizing the science rule, officially called "Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science."
Under it, the agency would have to dismiss or give less weight to scientific studies that fail to release all their raw data to the public. Mr. Wheeler says the rule's opponents prefer that regulatory decisions be made in "a back room, a proverbial smoke filled room."
But thousands of medical and scientific organizations say the plan would cripple the E.P.A.'s ability to create new air and water protections because people who participate in epidemiological or long-term health studies that examine exposure to toxins typically take part only if their personal health information is kept private.
The E.P.A. under Mr. Wheeler has argued that it can create data protections to secure personal information like home addresses and medical records. But Dr. Sinks, who was the only agency scientist who worked to establish that data security, said the agency lacks the technical expertise and funding to succeed.
"Human subjects research is the most predictive data for establishing the human health impact from environmental exposures," Dr. Sinks wrote, adding, "Any rule or guidance that diminishes or removes high quality research from consideration in rule making results in poorly developed rules."
Thomas A. Burke, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who served as E.P.A. science adviser in the Obama administration, expressed amazement at Dr. Sinks's dissent.
"It speaks volumes about the failure of the process and the failure of the administration to listen not just to this one person but to the broader scientific leadership in the United States," he said. Mr. Burke called the rule "a very thinly-veiled dream rule for polluters."
James Hewitt, a spokesman for the E.P.A., said in a statement that Dr. Sinks's objections were "irrelevant." He accused Dr. Sinks, without presenting evidence, of failing to follow agency "protocol for raising concerns" and also said Dr. Sinks did not read the most recent draft of the rule before filing his dissent. Mr. Hewitt also did not explain why such a high-ranking career scientist was not provided the final draft of the rule.
"The purpose of the science transparency rule is to codify internal procedural requirements for how the E.P.A. will consider the availability of data that it relies upon in developing its final significant regulatory actions and influential scientific information," Mr. Hewitt said.
Mr. Wheeler in these final months also sidestepped a promise he made to the E.P.A. inspector general to address accusations from more than 250 employees about political interference with science under the Trump administration.
Mr. Wheeler had agreed to determine the reasons for the concerns about a culture of disregard for scientific integrity and "tone at the top" of the agency by Sept. 30. He did not.
Instead he issued a memo in November affirming the agency's support for its 2012 scientific integrity policy. But even that document was watered down. The final version eliminated language that assured science would occur "without political interference, coercion of scientists or regard to risk management implications," according to a document of tracked changes reviewed by The New York Times.
Mr. Hewitt in a statement said that memo did not affect the underlying scientific integrity policy.
Of Mr. Wheeler's broader agenda over the next two months, he said, "E.P.A. continues to advance this administration's commitment to meaningful environmental progress while moving forward with our regulatory reform agenda."
The E.P.A. also is expected to finalize in the coming weeks a rule on industrial soot pollution, which is linked to respiratory diseases, including those caused by the coronavirus. The rule is expected to leave in place a 2012 standard on fine soot from smokestacks and tailpipes, known as PM 2.5, ignoring the E.P.A.'s own scientists, who wrote last year that the existing rule contributes to about 45,000 deaths per year from respiratory diseases, and that tightening it could save about 10,000 of those lives.
In April, a study published by researchers at Harvard linked long-term soot exposure and Covid-19 death rates. The study found that a person living for decades in a county with high levels of fine particulate matter is 15 percent more likely to die from the coronavirus than someone in a region with one unit less of the fine particulate pollution.
And last month, the agency finalized a rule that creates a lengthy new legal process to overturn or withdraw certain policy directives known as "guidance documents," which give federal agencies direction on the specifics of how to enforce laws.
Such guidance documents can give an administration some license to interpret laws in ways that advance their policy agenda. For example, the E.P.A. during the Trump administration has published a guidance document that allows oil and gas companies to release flares from their wells for up to 15 minutes at a time before regulations apply -- a process that releases methane, a powerful planet-warming greenhouse gas.
Another guidance document allows polluting entities with several adjacent polluting buildings on the same site, such as power plants and factories, to report the separate buildings as smaller individual pollution sources, rather than report the total pollution levels of the overall site. That could allow the polluters to avoid pollution control requirements that would be triggered by reporting the larger amount of pollution attributed to the larger site.
These types of documents are not legally binding, but they do stand as the official policy of a government agency until they are formally withdrawn or changed. Under the new guidance document rule, the E.P.A. would have to formally issue a new regulation in order to withdraw the guidance -- a lengthy legal process that can take months or even years, meaning that until it is complete, those Trump guidance documents will stand as the official policies of the Biden administration.
Jody Freeman, a professor of environmental law at Harvard and a former adviser to the Obama administration, called the rule a "little I.E.D.," referring to an improvised explosive device, or roadside bomb, aimed at slowing a Biden administration's plans to overturn Mr. Trump's rules.
"Shenanigans like these are what awaits the Biden team," she said.

Texto completo: The chairwoman of the Wisconsin Elections Commission on Monday certified President-elect Joe Biden as the winner in Wisconsin, formalizing his narrow victory in a state President Trump carried four years ago and undermining the quixotic efforts of Trump and his supporters to portray his decisive national loss as a matter still under dispute.
During a three-minute teleconference Monday afternoon, Ann Jacobs, the elections commission chairwoman, signed a document that declared Biden to be the winner.
The Wisconsin certification came a few hours after Arizona officials formalized Biden's even narrower victory there.
Monday's certifications would be an afterthought in any other year. But in an environment where Trump's false claims of massive fraud have created an alternate reality among his die-hard backers — in the West Wing and beyond — the results foreclosed his fanciful final path to victory.
Trump, buoyed by his legal team and supporters in the conservative media, has held out hope that he could somehow prevail in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Georgia, where Republican officials on Monday firmly refused to challenge Biden's win there.
In Arizona, Biden prevailed by more than 10,000 votes, mainly because of his strength in the state's largest county, Maricopa, which has been trending Democratic in recent elections.
The state will deliver its 11 electoral votes to Biden when the Electoral College meets in December, a ceremonial conclave that Trump hopes to flip in his favor despite state laws that forbid electors from defying the will of voters.
The certification in Wisconsin followed the conclusion of recounts, requested and subsidized with $3 million from Trump's campaign, in Dane and Milwaukee Counties that resulted in Biden adding 87 votes to his statewide margin.
Two weeks ago the Trump campaign requested recounts in Dane and Milwaukee, the state's two largest and most Democratic counties, in an effort to build a legal case against Biden's statewide victory. Biden won Wisconsin by 20,565 votes, a margin that was always highly unlikely to be overturned in a recount.
The Trump campaign has argued in its recount petition that all ballots cast at pre-Election Day in-person absentee voting sites should be disqualified because, it claimed incorrectly, those absentee ballots were issued without voters submitting a written application requesting the ballot.

Georgia GOP officials, CEO of Dominion defend vote count
Two top Georgia Republicans who President Trump has attacked in his postelection campaign to subvert President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the state forcefully pushed back against the White House on Monday.
Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, once again rebuffed the president's demand that he review ballot signatures as part of a second audit that is nevertheless expected to affirm Biden's win later this week, and the state's governor, Brian Kemp, stood by him.
In two tweets early Monday, Trump said that Kemp should use emergency powers to overrule Raffensperger and compare the number of envelopes and ballots. The president claimed that doing so would reveal rampant fraud, an assertion that has been rejected by the state's Republican elections officials.
Trump called the governor “hapless."
Kemp flatly rejected him.
“Georgia law prohibits the Governor from interfering in elections," Kemp's spokesman, Cody Hall, wrote in a statement early Monday in response to Trump's tweet. “The Secretary of State, who is an elected Constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order."
Raffensperger, who has faced scathing personal attacks for standing up to Trump, went even further during a news conference Monday, portraying the president as a credulous, misinformed victim of “dishonest" advisers.
“There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half truths, and misinformation, and frankly they are misleading the president as well, apparently," said Raffensperger, who is overseeing a second audit of the results that is not expected to change the outcome. (Georgia has already completed a hand recount of more than 5 million ballots that reaffirmed Biden's victory.)
No significant evidence has been found to support the president's claims, and several judges in multiple states have quickly dismissed lawsuits by his legal team alleging fraud.
Meanwhile, John Poulos, president and chief executive of Dominion Voting Systems, pushed back in an op-ed published Monday on the “lies and smears" pushed by Trump and his allies about voting machines manufactured by the company helping deliver the election to Biden.
“The wild allegations of recent weeks have fueled the harassment of election officials and Dominion employees across the country — including stalking and death threats," Poulos wrote in the piece published by the Wall Street Journal. “The lies and smears have no basis in fact, but they do real damage to our democracy by casting doubt on the legitimacy of the electoral process."
In the op-ed, Poulos specifically denied a litany of claims repeated by Trump's legal team and other allies of the president.
“The allegations against Dominion are bizarre, but I'll set the record straight," he said. “Dominion is an American company, now headquartered in Denver. Dominion is not and has never been a front for communists. It has no ties to Hugo Chávez, the late dictator of Venezuela. It has never been involved in Venezuelan elections. None of Dominion's systems use the Smartmatic software that has come under attack, as any state certification lab could verify. There is no secret 'vote flipping' algorithm."

Fired election security chief reaffirms vote integrity
In his first interview after President Trump fired him from his post leading the Department of Homeland Security's effort to help to secure the election, Christopher Krebs reaffirmed on Sunday that there was no evidence of voter fraud and the integrity of the election had not been compromised.
“There is no foreign power that is flipping votes. There's no domestic actor flipping votes. I did it right. We did it right," Krebs told CBS News's Scott Pelley on “60 Minutes." “This was a secure election."
Trump vehemently disagreed, turning to his Twitter feed Sunday to excoriate Krebs and the news program, and reassert his unfounded claims that the election he lost was “probably our least secure EVER!"
“NO WAY WE LOST THIS ELECTION!" tweeted Trump, again without evidence, in another claim marked as “disputed" on Twitter.
Krebs, a Republican who joined the DHS in 2017 as a senior counselor to then-Secretary John Kelly, was confirmed in 2018 as undersecretary for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, later rebranded to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).
Krebs seemingly fell out of Trump's good graces when CISA released a joint statement with the coordinating council of state and local federal government entities in charge of protecting elections that called the election “the most secure in American history."
Five days later, on Nov. 17, Krebs, like many other government officials over the past four years, learned he was terminated from one of the president's tweets.

Sean Hannity: Trump should pardon himself and family

Texto completo: Fox News host Sean Hannity called for President Trump to protect himself preemptively against new federal investigations when he leaves office.
Responding to an op-ed by Andrew Weissmann, a top prosecutor in former special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, Hannity recommended that Trump use his pardon power as the head of the executive branch to make him immune to future prosecutions related to the Russia investigation.
Hannity said he was in favor of Trump pardoning himself and his family if a Biden administration prosecutes him.
"You've got Robert Mueller's 'pitbull,' Andrew Weissmann, writing in the New York Times that he believes that the next attorney general, if it's Biden's, should investigate Trump and ... prosecute him for potential crimes, going back to Russia. An obstruction on Russia, when it was based on a phony dossier," Hannity said, contextualizing his call for Trump to pardon himself.
Hannity then referenced his earlier comments made on his radio show, saying, "If that's what they want to do, if Biden ever became president, I'd tell Trump pardon yourself and pardon your family."
iFrame Object
"The president out the door needs to pardon his whole family and himself because they want this witch hunt to go on in perpetuity," Hannity said. "I assume that the power of the pardon is absolute and that he should be able to pardon anybody that he wants to?" he asked Sidney Powell, an attorney involved in the 2020 presidential election legal fight.
"It is absolute. It's in the Constitution. I don't know about his authority to pardon himself. But it should not be necessary, and aside from that, the president is going to get another four years in office to finish the job he started because the election fraud we are uncovering is massive," Powell said.
Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency who was fired by Trump this month, says that no domestic or foreign actors changed any votes, despite claims by Trump and some of his supporters that the election was “rigged” or “stolen” to the benefit of President-elect Joe Biden.
iFrame Object
In the op-ed for the New York Times, Weissmann said the Justice Department should investigate the Trump family despite the fact it may be "painful and hard" for the country.
"I do not come to this position lightly. Indeed, we have witnessed two U.S. presidential elections in which large crowds have found it acceptable to chant with fervent zeal that the nominee of the opposing party should be jailed. We do not want to turn into an autocratic state, where law enforcement authorities are political weapons of the reigning party," Weissmann wrote. "But that is not sufficient reason to let Mr. Trump off the hook."

Midwest has yet to see peak of latest COVID-19 surge, experts fear

Texto completo: Hot-spot Midwestern states have reported modest declines in new daily COVID-19 cases over the past few days, but epidemiologists have warned against taking this as a sign that the surge is over.
“I think it is premature to feel that we turned the corner until we see at least a week or two to have sort of [a] decline,” said Dr. Oguzhan Alagoz, an expert in healthcare analytics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
New daily cases in most Midwestern states have declined in recent days, offering a glimmer of hope that the third surge of the pandemic pummeling that specific region is on its way out. Epidemiologists say that hope disguises the persistent surge across the region; a surge they expect will worsen as the weather gets colder and people spend more time indoors.
“This is why there’s going be relatively more opportunities for the virus to transmit,” Alagoz said. “Unfortunately, I don't believe that we have turned the corner yet, maybe next week. Let's have another conversation after we look at the data, but at this moment … I think we may see another increase.”
State-by-state virus tracking by the New York Times shows that cases in most Midwestern states have increased drastically in the past two weeks. The average rate of new daily cases in Ohio has increased roughly 68% since two weeks ago, while Indiana’s average case rate has risen 42% over that same period.
Several Midwestern states that have some of the highest test positivity rates since early October, such as Iowa and the Dakotas, have recorded declines in new daily cases. Iowa’s average rate of new cases, for instance, declined from 52% in the week ending Nov. 13 to 41.1% on Tuesday, still about double the rate reported this time last month.
“There have been some modest decreases, but those modest decreases are from very, very high initial starting places,” Dr. Amber D’Souza, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, told the Washington Examiner. “There are a few encouraging signs that some progress is being made, but we are definitely still in Code Red.”
The devastating increase in cases combined with holiday travel have raised the specter of an even more severe surge covering more territory across the country.
“We're already at rates that are higher than most areas in the U.S. ... And now, we have increased travel at a level that I don't think we've seen during the pandemic,” D’Souza said. "That is a recipe for a really rough upcoming few weeks.”
Pleas from healthcare providers and the federal government to avoid travel appear to be falling on deaf ears. The Transportation Security Administration reported that last weekend was the busiest weekend for travel since mid-March, with more than 3 million total security check-ins from Friday through Sunday alone. As of Tuesday, more than 6 million people had traveled by plane over the past week. Still, this year’s holiday travel rates are just a fraction of what they were in 2019, with 15.8 million total travels over the same period last year.
Meanwhile, demand for travel by train has plummeted more sharply. Amtrak spokesman Jason Abrams told the New York Times that demand for train travel is only 20% of what it was in 2019. AAA projected two weeks ago that 50 million people in the United States will travel for the holiday, which is down 10% from 2019, making it the largest one-year decrease since the Great Recession in 2008.

Texto completo: Since 2008, partisan distrust of presidential election results has been substantial. In 2016, only 43 percent of Democrats believed that the election was free and fair; now, only 30 percent of Republicans do. Each party’s supporters are more likely to believe that the vote was free and fair if they won, and those on the losing side are becoming more suspicious of the results. With a defeated president trying for weeks to overturn an election he has falsely called fraudulent, our partisan breach will be hard to repair.
But electoral reform can still provide a better foundation of trust. Two decades since the 2000 Florida recount debacle revealed the shoddiness of how America votes, we should be able to provide a straightforward, sensible answer to anyone who asks, “How do you know the results are correct?”
Yet, we still do not have nationwide standards and procedures to assure Americans that results are reliable. Claims of widespread fraud are false, but we can do much more to provide stronger answers to those who might want to question the process or the results.
The true scandal is that we know what we need to do and have even begun to implement reforms in many states, but we have not instituted the changes nationwide.
The basics come down to this:
Easier registration, with standardized voter databases, would keep voters from being incorrectly purged from the rolls — which can disenfranchise them — or being left on them when they move — which creates mistrust and suspicions of fraud.
The easiest method is called automatic voter registration: If an eligible citizen has an interaction with a government agency, like the motor vehicle department, she’s registered unless she declines, and the records are sent digitally to the registrar, which means cleaner, more up-to-date voter rolls. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia are already running such a system. This should be expanded nationwide.
We need to encourage states to exchange voter data so the records of people who move or die can easily be updated. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has been developing a common data format that would allow registrars in one state to exchange information with those in another state, greatly increasing the integrity of the rolls. A consortium of 30 states and the District of Columbia already has formed the Election Registration Information Center to make it easier for states to share data to both reach out to unregistered voters and to keep track of people who move or die so they are not wrongly kept on voter rolls.
Voting rights groups have long asserted that purges of voter rolls — often disproportionately affecting minorities or students, two groups who tend to vote Democratic — are a form of voter suppression. The Republican answer has been that they are only for maintenance, to ensure ineligible voters don’t remain on the books. If that’s the concern, the fastest way to fix all this would be to adopt these standards for registration and data exchange.
Republican officials across the country have also tried to make voting harder — especially in blue districts, particularly to obstruct Black voters. That strategy is not only deeply wrong, it’s backfiring. Voter turnout was higher this year for both Republicans and Democrats.
Still, we should not continue to rely on the tenacity of voters to overcome these obstacles. Research consistently finds that Black and Latino voters wait much longer in line to vote than their white counterparts, and this is simply unacceptable. There should be a sufficient number of voting booths everywhere so nobody has to wait in line for too long, and this should be a funded federal mandate.
But it’s not enough to have the potential to vote quickly if one doesn’t actually get to vote because of problematic record-keeping at the polling place. Electronic or paper poll books are used to check if a voter is registered to vote at a particular location. Nationwide use of standardized, secured electronic poll books, with a paper backup copy, would greatly help speed up voting, lessen suspicions of fraud and instances of disenfranchisement — and even make counting faster by reducing the need for provisional ballots when a registration is disputed. Increasing numbers of states already use a version of such digital poll books, but there needs to be a national standard for their certification and security, along with national funding.
The number of people who are estimated to vote with no paper trail is down to 5 percent of the electorate — still high, but a number that’s been steadily going down (it was 25 percent in 2016). Optical scanners, which use paper ballots, provide everything we need: easy-to-mark ballots that can be processed by machines for speed or for checking, and easy to audit and do recounts — people can look at them if necessary after the election.
These systems are already nearly universal, demonstrating that progress is possible. They should become the national standard as we upgrade the remaining paper-based ballot-marking devices and replace all electronic-only devices.
Even with a system that’s expected to work well, we need to know that it has worked well. Like any other equipment, optical-scan counting machines can fail, and human error can add to this. That’s why we should have risk-limiting audits after each election after the counting is complete but before the result is certified.
In such audits, a small number of randomly selected ballots are examined and compared with the already reported results. Well-established statistical methods allow us to spot potential problems — be it errors with scanners, human error, manipulation. This helps us feel confident that the reported result is what we’d get if all ballots were correctly counted. Risk-limiting audits should be a standard final step before certifying elections.
Georgia’s electoral laws mandate such audits, and its Republican secretary of state undertook just that (though he decided to audit all the presidential votes given the controversy drummed up by the president and the narrow margin). Colorado, Rhode Island and Virginia also have such audits on their books. Georgia’s effort is a pilot program, as are those in Indiana and Nevada.
During the audit in Georgia, a discovery was made of a few thousand ballots that had not been counted because of human error in uploading results — too small to change the outcome, but showing exactly why audits are a good idea before results are certified.
In such a polarized climate it may seem difficult or impossible to pass legislation on voting, but it’s in neither party’s long-term interest to have this kind of suspicion hover around elections. The secretary of state in Georgia has shown that officials dedicated to election integrity can oversee a safe, fair vote, with transparency, even if the result is against their partisan interests. And some — though too few — prominent members of the Republican Party have expressed their discontent with the president’s baseless claims of fraud. It’s time for them to join reform efforts.
There is a notable overlap of interests. Voting machines are distrusted by people in both parties, and postelection audits help everyone. Improving voter registration makes registration easier (usually a Democratic demand) and removes suspicions of voter fraud (usually a Republican demand).
If the Biden administration made this a priority, it would take just a few Republican senators to pass legislation to fix many of our ailments with the electoral process.
There are other, broader, questions, of course, like developing national standards for handling of mail-in ballots and making Election Day a holiday. Plus, all this doesn’t address other crucial problems of our electoral system — the Electoral College makes people outside swing states feel that presidential candidates do not fight for their votes, gerrymandering can cement minority rule and the Senate gives disproportionate power to tiny groups of people in small states.
Still, if we can’t get even voter registration and counting right, what hope is there?
We have well-studied methods that are effective, and there is nothing more urgent than making sure our elections work — everything else a government can try to do depends on that.

Texto completo: Last week, a dispatch from Nova Scotia left me reeling. The journalist Stephanie Nolen described her life in the province, not terribly far from the American mainland, as “a parallel dimension” where gym classes and dinner parties still happen and community spread of the coronavirus is low. In an effort to explain how the area beat back the virus, she wrote:
Our freedom feels precious and fragile. It has not come cheap. But it’s a steadying thing, the knowledge that we will make hard choices for each other, and that sometimes when we do, the reward is a life we recognize.
What struck me is how Nolen’s understanding of freedom feels so at odds with the American response to the pandemic, which frequently invokes “freedom” as an excuse to serve one’s own interests before the interests of others. Hers is an expansive, collectivist view that appears well suited to saving lives. Some Americans hold a different understanding of freedom: instant gratification followed by triage once the number of deaths becomes too hard to ignore.
In May, I wrote that my biggest fear was that our pandemic response would mirror our treatment of the gun violence epidemic. That we would get used to all the dying. That our leaders would be too cowardly to enact responsible policies. That a debate about health and science would be hijacked and politicized by extremists, reducing complex policies to a false binary: freedom versus tyranny.
I spoke then with Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and Brown University associate professor who works on gun violence prevention. She expressed her frustration that the dynamics of the two epidemics felt similar. In both cases, she said, we approached the issue using a narrow American lens. “We know from other countries what effective responses look like but we can’t imagine those for ourselves,” she told me. “We become distracted from what actually works.”
As if to prove my column’s point, I quickly moved on from paying attention to the gun violence epidemic after writing the piece. But gun deaths and violence have not declined during the pandemic. According to the Gun Violence Archive, in the first 10 months of 2020 there were 15,646 gun deaths, 32,459 gun injuries and 1,829 unintentional shootings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that there have been over 20,000 suicides. Even mass shootings barely make headlines in 2020.
As we enter the holiday season, with COVID-19 cases rising exponentially and hospital systems threatening to collapse under the strain, the discussion around whether to gather this Thanksgiving has been subsumed by the same freedom- versus-tyranny dynamics as the gun debate has been — almost to the point of parody:
Last Thursday, I spoke on the phone again with Dr. Ranney. She was on a walk, getting a bit of fresh air and sunlight before another shift intubating critically ill patients dying of COVID-19. She was, despite the enormous weight of watching the pandemic’s destruction up close, calm and cleareyed. She described herself as “angry and scared for what’s coming in the next month.”
When I asked her why, she said, “Thanksgiving.” Here’s her response in full:
“I hate to be apocalyptic, but it’ll be the day that will determine our trajectory for the rest of the year. If everyone goes to celebrate, we’re screwed. It’ll seed hundreds of thousands of infections in a single day.”
What she means is that even if America locked down completely the day after Thanksgiving — which is not going to happen — the country would still face an unthinkable stretch of death and destruction.
Once again, the subject of gun violence prevention came up. The biggest similarity, she said, is that our failures seem to come from leadership as well as from individuals — inaction and abdication of responsibility feed each other and the problem gets worse, despite simple solutions being available. “Nobody is blameless here,” she said.
That sounds bleak. But read another way, it’s empowering.
Before we hung up, I asked Dr. Ranney what she’s learned during these brutal months. “What both gives me hope and scares me is that individual Americans have tremendous power to do good as well as evil,” she said.
What she’s describing is, in essence, our freedom and how we can choose to exercise it. As such, they’re words worth considering this week. You don’t have to be helpless. You don’t have to get used to the dying. There’s something you can do right now. You can make the hard choice on behalf of others. You can stay home.

Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused disputed theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Donald Trump on the pandemic, has resigned his White House position, according to a senior government official.
The move was not entirely unexpected. Atlas caught Trump’s eye with his frequent appearances on the Fox News Channel over the summer, and joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term that was set to expire this week. Fox News first reported his resignation, which Atlas later announced on Twitter.
“I worked hard with a singular focus — to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,” Atlas wrote in a letter obtained by Fox, adding that he “always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.”
But some of Atlas’ administration colleagues would likely differ with that assessment, citing views that differ starkly from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government scientists. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot pass on the coronavirus.
Even more controversial was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Atlas’ view, the government’s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as COVID-19 takes its course.
His argument was that most people infected with the virus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people will have antibodies from COVID-19 to deprive the virus of carriers — “herd immunity.” Public health experts were appalled, and Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator.
“I don’t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes. I just do, period,” Fauci said earlier this month on the NBC program “Today.”
But Atlas had the ear of one person who mattered: Trump.

The White House Christmas Decorations Look Strikingly Normal

The first lady has overseen holiday decorations at the White House since 1961, when Jacqueline Kennedy hung ornaments of toys, birds and angels themed to “The Nutcracker” ballet on a Christmas tree in the Blue Room. This year was no different.
In a one-minute video posted to Twitter on Monday, Melania Trump unveiled this year’s theme, “America the Beautiful,” which she translated as green trees decorated with red, gold and silver ornaments and white lights, a style so traditional that it could grace the cover of Martha Stewart Living. The East Colonnade this year features simple black urns holding plumes of foliage and greenery from each state and territory.
The bold aesthetic choices that drew so much flak and snarky memes in Christmases past are noticeably absent. There are no blood-red trees, as there were in 2018, which various news outlets called “creepy” and “deeply haunted.” There is nothing akin to the icy, underlit branches of 2017 that turned the East Colonnade into what some likened to a barren, dystopian landscape.
This year, a toy train — the “White House Express” — circles a wreath placed on a center table. Crafty ornaments bear the names of children from Maryland, Michigan and the Northern Mariana Islands. Other decorations celebrate “pioneers for gender equality,” as the first lady’s office put it, including artist Georgia O’Keeffe.
This is Trump’s last Christmas at the White House as first lady, and if her tree trimmings seem unimpeachable by design, that may be the point. She received an early lump of coal in her stocking in September, when her former adviser Stephanie Winston Wolkoff published a tell-all memoir, “Melania and Me.”
Among the newsworthy comments Trump made in the book — and in secretly recorded conversations Winston Wolkoff released — was her complaint about the chore of the holidays, and her negative press coverage compared to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.
Trump was heard on the recordings delivering a profanity-laced rant about “Christmas stuff” and decorations. “But I need to do it, right?” she added.
Trump has also been tasked with spreading cheer at a time when daily deaths from COVID-19 are approaching tallies not seen since the spring and many Americans are canceling holiday plans out of fear of spreading the virus. Her decorations, including a snow-covered mini hospital and ornaments of a garbage truck, a nurse’s hat and a lab coat, nod to the pandemic and essential workers.
Early reviews of the decorations have been charitable.
CNN highlighted a tree in the Vermeil Room with ornaments featuring a portrait of President John F. Kennedy and sailboats, and another tree in the library celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, noting, “Significant thought and detail went into the Americana decorations.”
The Independent wrote: “Ms. Trump and an army of volunteers put together a warmer, less edgy display that runs throughout the Executive Mansion.”
Even outlets that have been harshly critical of Trump’s take on the holidays couldn’t work up the energy this year. Consider this tepid headline from Mashable: “Melania Trump unveils her final White House Christmas decorations and they’re fine.”
The website gave grudging respect to Trump, and seemed almost disappointed not to carry on the recent holiday tradition, undertaken by much of the media, of skewering the White House Christmas design choices. “Playing it safe is probably a good strategy this year,” the article said. “This theme is harder to meme, for sure.”

PARIS — In its first award since a pedophilia scandal revealed deep-rooted collusion within its ranks, one of France’s top literary juries avoided the appearance of any potential conflicts of interest Monday by crowning the novel of a little-known female author from a small publishing house.
Judges of the Renaudot gave the prize for best novel to Marie-Hélène Lafon, an outsider of France’s clubby literary circles. Her book, “Histoire du fils,” was published by Buchet-Chastel, a company with an annual catalog of about 50 works and the first-time winner of a major award.
The jury of the Renaudot has been under intense scrutiny since members acknowledged rewarding pedophile writer Gabriel Matzneff in the essay category in 2013 to help revive his career and cheer him up. Its fierce resistance to change has come to embody the tight grip of an established elite on France’s literary institutions.
This year, like many before it, the short list for the prize was made up of literary insiders whose novels were published by leading companies and whose ties to several of the jurors were widely known. So the choice of Lafon was a safe one for a jury girding itself for criticism.
“I’m aware that there are ethical stakes at work behind all this,” Lafon said after the award was announced over Zoom because of coronavirus restrictions. “The situation is perilous. We’re walking on a tightrope.”
But the choice of Lafon’s novel was applauded as a recognition of literary quality by experts and literature fans on social media. The saga spans a century and looks at a family secret that the main character tries to unravel by reconstructing the genealogy of his family.
The novel is “a beautiful piece of work” from a writer whose rural background has long inspired her books, said Marie-Rose Guarnieri, a bookstore owner and a critic of France’s major literary juries, on which jurors usually serve for life. Two decades ago, Guarnieri established the Wepler, a literary prize with a jury that changes every year.
But Guarnieri said she did not believe the choice reflected a profound shift in the Renaudot’s outlook. Over the years, the jury has tried to deflect occasional criticism by rewarding an unknown author from a small publisher, she said.
“When they begin to realize that we can see how they work,” Guarnieri said, “and especially the big conflicts of interest that arise from this way of selecting books, they make a big swing in the other direction.”
Reached by phone, Georges-Olivier Châteaureynaud, the president of the Renaudot, declined to comment.
Dominique Bona, the only woman among the Renaudot’s nine jurors and a member of the French Academy, told the Agence France-Presse that her jury had become a “scapegoat.” The jurors, she said, are “genuinely inspired by the love we all have for literature.”
Following decades of tradition, the Renaudot announced its winner immediately after the Goncourt, France’s top prize, made its choice known.
The prize for best novel went to Hervé Le Tellier, a former journalist, for “L’Anomalie,” a science-fiction thriller that revolves around the double lives of passengers aboard a Paris-New York flight. It was published by France’s most prestigious publishing house, Gallimard, which has now captured 38 Goncourt awards since the creation of the prize in 1903.
Early this year, a tell-all book about Matzneff led to unsettling revelations about collusion inside the Renaudot jury. The writer’s editor, Christian Giudicelli, and friends — all members of the jury — awarded him the prize for best essay in 2013. All of the Renaudot’s current nine jurors were part of the jury that year.
Giudicelli has been questioned in an ongoing police investigation into Matzneff’s pedophilia and has drawn criticism for the role he played in furthering his friend’s career. Activists in the city of Vichy have pressed him to step down from a literary jury financed by the local government, where he has also long been a juror.
“As long as Mr. Giudicelli is not suspended, the city is officially considering suspending our financial participation in the prize,” Frédéric Aguilera, the mayor of Vichy, said in a phone interview Monday.
The spotlight on the Renaudot has also raised questions about the legitimacy of France’s other top prizes, including the Goncourt.
Jurors serve for life — or until age 80 at the Goncourt — and select prize winners in a process rife with conflicts of interests. None adhere to the strict standards of Britain’s Booker or the Pulitzer in the United States, whose juries change every year and whose jurors recuse themselves over potential conflicts of interest.
Still, differences exist among the top prizes, and the Renaudot suffers from the most potential conflicts of interests, with four of its nine current jurors working for publishers whose books were among award candidates this year.
The Goncourt is considered — in France at least — the cleanest jury. Alone among top prizes, the Goncourt has carried out reforms, in 2008, that barred jurors from working at a publishing company and created a mandatory retirement age.
“What’s extraordinary is that a reform was necessary,” said Pierre Assouline, a writer and juror on the Goncourt since 2012. “A conflict of interest in the world of business is condemned right away. But not here.”
The Renaudot never considered adopting any of the Goncourt’s changes, longtime jurors said. Over the past 20 years, potential conflicts of interest have only increased at the jury.
From 2010 to 2019, on average, nearly three of the Renaudot jurors shared publishing ties with a laureate for the novel category — up from barely one between 2000 and 2009, according to an analysis by The New York Times.
Though the Goncourt’s reforms were short of the standards at the Booker or Pulitzer, they had an immediate impact on the composition of the prize winners. Before the overhaul, prizes were monopolized by big publishers with strong ties to the Goncourt jurors.
Actes Sud, once a small publisher that — on principle — has long refused to allow its editors to serve on juries, had been almost completely shut out of the big awards for decades. But since the 2008 reforms, Actes Sud has scooped up four Goncourt prizes, including in 2012 for Jérôme Ferrari’s novel, “The Sermon on the Fall of Rome.”
The financial windfall was immediate: Only 9,700 copies had been sold before the novel made the Goncourt’s first list. Inclusion on the list helped sales rise to 52,000, and then they skyrocketed to 370,000 after the award.
“It’s just transformed into an easy Christmas present,” Ferrari said in a recent interview, referring to the popularity of prize-winning books as holiday gifts.
Other top juries, like the Femina, debated emulating the Goncourt, but ultimately decided against any change, said Christine Jordis, a Femina juror since 1996 and a longtime editor and professional reader at Gallimard.
Jordis said she had led the fight against barring jurors from working at publishing companies, believing that her years as an editor gave her expertise.

WASHINGTON — Dr. Scott W. Atlas, the former Stanford University radiologist who espoused controversial theories and rankled government scientists while advising President Donald Trump on the coronavirus pandemic, resigned his White House position Monday.
The move was not entirely unexpected. Atlas joined the White House in August as a special government employee for a limited term after he caught Trump’s eye with his frequent appearances on Fox News over the summer. Atlas’ term was set to expire this week.
“I worked hard with a singular focus — to save lives and help Americans through this pandemic,” Atlas wrote in a letter that he posted Monday night on Twitter, adding, “I always relied on the latest science and evidence, without any political consideration or influence.” Fox News earlier reported his resignation.
But some of Atlas’ Trump administration colleagues would most likely contradict that assessment, citing views starkly different from those put forth by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and by other government scientists. Atlas has argued, for example, that the science of mask wearing is uncertain and that children cannot spread the coronavirus.
Even more contentious was his libertarian vision of the role of the government in the pandemic. In Atlas’ view, the government’s job was not to stamp out the virus but simply to protect its most vulnerable citizens as COVID-19 took its course.
His argument was that most people infected with the coronavirus would not get seriously ill, and at some point, enough people would have antibodies from COVID-19 to deprive the virus of carriers — so-called herd immunity. Atlas also railed against anything that smacked of a lockdown or business closure.
“Protect the high-risk; open schools, society,” he tweeted in October. “Alternative? Confine healthy people, restrict business, close schools…kills people, destroys families, sacrifices kids. #RationalThinking.”
Public health experts were appalled and warned that his ideas were dangerous and would have disastrous results.
But that did not stop Atlas. In mid-November, he called on people in Michigan to “rise up” against coronavirus restrictions. The state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who had faced death threats and a thwarted kidnapping attempt over the restrictions, denounced him as “incredibly reckless.”
But in his resignation letter and the accompanying tweet, Atlas defended himself.
“We also identified and illuminated early on the harms of prolonged lockdowns, including that they create massive physical health losses and psychological distress, destroy families and damage our children,” he wrote.
“And more and more,” he added, “the relatively low risk to children of serious harms from the infection, the less frequent spread from children, the presence of immunologic protection beyond that shown by antibody testing, and the severe harms from closing schools and society are all being acknowledged.”
Inside the administration, Atlas clashed in particular with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease specialist, and Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator.
While Atlas was playing down the necessity of wearing masks, Birx was traveling the country preaching the opposite. She implored governors and public health officials in hard-hit states to take more aggressive steps. The two also clashed repeatedly in private.
But Atlas’ disagreements with Fauci were more visceral — and more public.
After the election, Atlas accused Fauci of being a “political animal” who changed his assessment of the threat of the pandemic after it became clear that Trump had lost. Fauci replied in kind.
“I don’t want to say anything against Dr. Atlas as a person, but I totally disagree with the stand he takes,” he said recently on the “Today” show on NBC, after Atlas’ comments about Michigan. “I just do, period.”
But Atlas had the ear of the one person who mattered: Trump.
“He has many great ideas,” the president told reporters in August at a White House briefing, with Atlas seated feet away. “And he thinks what we’ve done is really good, and now we’ll take it to a new level.”

‘Trump Is Better’: In Asia, Pro-Democracy Forces Worry About Biden

BANGKOK — A dissident once branded Enemy No. 1 by the Chinese Communist Party is spreading conspiracy theories about vote-rigging in the U.S. presidential election.
Pro-democracy campaigners from Hong Kong are championing President Donald Trump’s claims of an electoral victory.
Human rights activists and religious leaders in Vietnam and Myanmar are expressing reservations about President-elect Joe Biden’s ability to keep authoritarians in check.
It might seem counterintuitive that Asian defenders of democracy are among the most ardent supporters of Trump, who has declared his friendship with Xi Jinping of China and Kim Jong Un of North Korea. But it is precisely Trump’s willingness to flout diplomatic protocol, abandon international accords and keep his opponents off-balance that have earned him plaudits as a leader strong enough to stand up to dictators and defend democratic ideals overseas, even if he has been criticized as diminishing them at home.
As Biden now assembles his foreign-policy team, prominent human rights activists across Asia are worried about his desire for the United States to hew again to international norms. They believe that Biden, like former President Barack Obama, will pursue accommodation rather than confrontation in the face of China’s assertive moves. And their pro-Trump views have been cemented by online misinformation, often delivered by dubious news sources, that Biden is working in tandem with communists or is a closet socialist sympathizer.
“Biden is president, and it’s like having Xi Jinping sitting in the White House,” said Elmer Yuen, a Hong Kong entrepreneur who has posted YouTube videos criticizing the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP. “He wants to coexist with China, and whoever coexists with the CCP loses.”
With Trump’s presidential tenure in its twilight, these activists are calling for the administration to make a final stand against Asian autocrats, similar to a last-ditch effort to expand the border wall with Mexico.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took a five-nation swing through Asia in October in which he abandoned politesse and described the Chinese government as a “predator,” “lawless and threatening,” and “the gravest threat to the future of religious freedom.” The tour was meant as a counterweight to China in a region where Beijing’s dollar diplomacy has bought significant influence.
In November, Lobsang Sangay became the first head of the Tibetan government-in-exile to visit the White House; the provocative invite infuriated Beijing, which considers Sangay to be a separatist.
In June, Pompeo met with Hong Kong democracy leader Joshua Wong and President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, both of whom are loathed by the Chinese government.
Trump’s popularity is particularly enduring among Christians, such as Chinese-born legal scholars chafing against communism’s atheist core and ethnic minority activists in Southeast Asia. Pompeo and other Trump administration officials, they believe, have been fulfilling a faith-based mission overseas.
Last year, Trump met in the White House with a group of religious leaders from across the world, including Hkalam Samson, president of the Kachin Baptist Convention, which represents the persecuted Christian Kachin minority in Myanmar.
“My experience in the White House, when I was given one minute to speak out about the Kachin, meant a lot, and it also meant that Trump cares about us,” Samson said. “Trump is better for the Kachin than Biden.”
Skepticism for Biden extends to those fighting for secular political rights as well. The president-elect’s embrace of diplomatic custom will not work when only one side is playing fairly, they say.
“For Biden’s policies toward China, the part about making China play by the international rules, I think, is very hollow,” said Wang Dan, who helped lead the 1989 Tiananmen protests as a university student. “As we know, the Chinese Communist Party hardly abides by international rules.
“The United States must realize that there will be no improvements on human rights issues in China if there is no regime change,” Wang added. He has continued to question Trump’s electoral loss, baseless claims shared by other prominent Chinese-born dissidents.
But others within the community, particularly in Hong Kong and China, said that backing Trump is hypocritical at best and dangerous at worst.
“Trump’s human rights record — what he does to migrant children, the Muslim ban, white supremacy, alternative truth — removes him from my support, but this is apparently not the popular attitude among many dissidents in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,” said Badiucao, a China-born political artist who now lives in self-exile in Australia.
Badiucao, who is known by a pseudonym to protect his family in China, has skirmished online with Wang and other well-known dissidents and has made the scuffle a topic for his art.
“These guys are utilitarian, and they believe that if Trump is waging war against the CCP then he’s right for them,” Badiucao said. “That mentality fits the whole ‘America First’ ideology, where it’s OK for other people to suffer if your goal is met, and their goal is overthrowing the CCP.”
Over the last 12 months, the Trump administration has stepped up its actions in Asia.
Late last year, the U.S. government barred military leaders from Myanmar from entering the country because of their role in what Pompeo called “gross violations of human rights” of Rohingya Muslims and other minority groups. Financial sanctions were also placed on individuals in Pakistan and Cambodia, among other countries, where civil liberties are under threat.
This summer, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Carrie Lam, chief executive of Hong Kong, and 10 others for “undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and restricting the freedom of expression or assembly of the citizens of Hong Kong.” Four more officials were added to the sanctions list in November.
In June, Trump signed legislation that led to sanctions being placed on Chinese officials who have overseen the construction of mass detention camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where more than 1 million people, mostly members of the Uighur Muslim minority, have been imprisoned.
“The Trump administration by far has done more to raise our issue than all other countries combined,” said Salih Hudayar, who was born in Xinjiang and moved to the United States as a child. “I’m very skeptical of a Biden administration because I am worried he will allow China to go back to normal, which is a 21st-century genocide of the Uighurs.”
During the presidential campaign, Biden released a statement calling the situation in Xinjiang a “genocide.” The Trump administration has not used such a designation, and a book by his former national security adviser said that Trump told Xi that he should continue building the detention camps in Xinjiang.
Foreign policy advisers to Biden say it is unfair to presume that he will continue the Obama administration’s moderate stance. It is, they say, a different era. The recent human rights legislation championed by the Trump administration has received broad bipartisan support.
And some Asian dissidents acknowledge that the antipathy toward Biden is driven in part by a deluge of online misinformation that paints the president-elect as a secret socialist or contends, without any proof, that foreign “communist money” turned the election against Trump. Such unsubstantiated claims have been repeated by niche online publications in Vietnamese, Chinese and other languages.
“The crisis of democracy in the world makes people, especially activists, confused and susceptible to the influence of conspiracy theories and information manipulation,” said Nguyen Quang A, a Vietnamese dissident who has been detained multiple times for his criticism of the country’s communist leadership. “Vietnam doesn’t have independent media, and people, especially activists, already hate mainstream media.”
One of the most influential voices spreading false narratives about Biden and the election on Twitter is Ai Weiwei, the Chinese contemporary artist who now lives in overseas exile.
In an interview, Ai said that he was not a fan of Trump. For his art, he has posed at Trump properties with his middle finger raised. But Ai said that by shutting off debate on his social media feed, he would be no different from an authoritarian government like China’s.
“All over Asia, all over the world, people don’t have the right to speak,” he said. “In America, left or right, you have personal freedoms. This has to be protected.”

BRUSSELS — A high-level look at NATO’s next 10 years recommends significant changes to confront the new challenges of an aggressive Russia and a rising China, urging overhauls to fortify the alliance’s cohesion and better coordinate with democratic allies around the world.
NATO did well boosting military deterrence after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and annexation of Crimea in 2014, the report commissioned by the alliance says. But with a similar challenge to the West arising from an ambitious and authoritarian China, it says the alliance now needs to make similar advances on the political side, including reaching out more consistently to Asian allies anxious about Beijing’s ambitions.
Covering 138 specific recommendations in some 60 pages, the report will be a major source of discussion Tuesday, the start of a two-day meeting of NATO foreign ministers that is likely to be the last for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The report is scheduled to be released Tuesday evening, but its contents were described in advance to The New York Times by several people familiar with them.
The report was requested by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg after President Emmanuel Macron of France said a year ago that NATO was experiencing “brain death” because of a lack of strategic coordination and U.S. leadership.
According to a diplomat from a NATO country, the report is a kind of riposte to Macron but also an effort to respond to his legitimate criticisms of an alliance that has been slow to adapt its structures and its reach, and where decision-making is a cumbersome and often arduous process that hinders quick reaction.
A co-chairman of the 10-member group of experts, A. Wess Mitchell, told NATO ambassadors in a private briefing that the report showed that “NATO is alive and kicking both in its cerebral function and its muscle tissue.’’
In an interview, Mitchell, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for Europe, acknowledged that the quotation was accurate. He said that the report was aimed at the future for an alliance whose last formal strategic concept was written a decade ago, when a different kind of relationship with Russia was hoped for and in which China was not even mentioned.
“Our intention is to be candid about the challenges to NATO, with a tone of well-grounded optimism,’’ Mitchell said. The main message, he said, is that “NATO has to adapt itself for an era of strategic rivalry with Russia and China, for the return of a geopolitical competition that has a military dimension but also a political one.’’
NATO, he added, is “first and foremost an alliance of Euro-Atlantic democracies, and must evolve politically to match its military evolution.’’
In this new world, internal division is damaging, Mitchell said. “That strategic competition makes schisms inside potentially more dangerous, because they can be exploited. So it also puts an emphasis on political cohesion.’’
To that end, the report does not recommend the scrapping of NATO’s principle of consensus, but suggests ways to speed up decisions. For example, numerous NATO partnership decisions with countries like Israel and even Austria are being held up by one country, in this case Turkey. The report suggests that such disputes be raised to the ministerial level, not left with the anonymity of ambassadors.
China is a significant part of the report, and it recommends setting up a consultative body to coordinate Western policy toward Beijing and to highlight Chinese activities that could affect Western security. Those include issues like spying, supply chains, information warfare and arms buildups.
With its technological ambitions, military expansion and trade policies, China can no longer be seen as simply an Asian player, the report argues, and NATO has been slow to respond to the challenge.
The report urges the creation of analytical centers better able to study disruptive and emerging technologies and to better use artificial intelligence, so the alliance can enhance its security and deterrence against cyber and hybrid warfare, beyond the traditional battlefield.
It should also use those capacities to improve the fight against terrorism and better coordinate policies that defend NATO’s southern members, which are less worried about Russia than about Islamist terrorism and state-sponsored wars, like in Libya, that create uncontrolled migration.
The report is also blunt about the problems of democratic adherence inside the alliance, arguing that with ideological rivals like Russia and China, the political health of the alliance matters more.
It recommends creating a Center of Excellence for Democratic Resilience and recommitting all members to the principles of the NATO founding treaty, whose prologue commits them to uphold “the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law.”
The report also urges closer coordination with the European Union and its own military efforts and ambitions. It recommends a permanent staffing link and a more explicit encouragement by NATO of EU efforts toward a more capable European defense, so far as they strengthen the alliance, contribute to fairer burden-sharing and do not exclude non-EU allies.
A senior diplomat from a NATO country called the report comprehensive, a foundation from which Stoltenberg can build recommendations to political leaders from the alliance for their next summit, expected early next year. NATO is expected, as the report urges, to approve the preparation of a new strategic concept to replace the one of 2010.
The EU has begun preparations to work with a new Biden administration. The European Commission and the European Council are studying proposals to work together with the United States on issues like health and pandemics, trade, climate, data protection and antitrust enforcement and screening of sensitive foreign investments, aimed particularly at China.
For the NATO report, Mitchell and his co-chairman, Thomas de Maizière, a German legislator and former defense minister, were joined by other experts from various NATO countries, including Hubert Védrine, a former French foreign minister; Marta Dassu, a former Italian deputy foreign minister; and Tacan Ildem, a senior Turkish diplomat and NATO’s former assistant secretary-general for public diplomacy.
The group met virtually in scores of sessions with politicians, diplomats and experts and approved the report by consensus.

PARIS — As a second lockdown appeared inevitable amid skyrocketing coronavirus infections, the scientists advising the French government in October warned that keeping students in their classrooms meant it would take longer to tame the surge.
The government kept the schools open anyway, even as the country became an epicenter of the second wave of the coronavirus in Europe. French leaders decided that they would try to subdue the surge, while also trying to minimize economic and academic damage by keeping children learning where they do it best: in school.
Five weeks into a second nationwide lockdown, France, like much of Europe, has proved that it is possible to bring the rate of known infections down, even with schools open.
It is a lesson that has been taken up late in the United States, where Chicago, Boston, San Francisco and other cities, have made it a priority to keep bars and restaurants open — though not necessarily for indoor service or at full capacity — even as they have closed their schools.
Many European countries, including France, have made the opposite choice: keeping schools open but closing restaurants and bars.
In France, 11% of coronavirus tests are coming back positive but students have kept going to school, while New York City shut its public schools on Nov. 19, after the positive test rate reached 3%.
But recent studies have shown that young children, at least, are low transmitters of the virus, and at least some U.S. officials are reconsidering their approach: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York abruptly decided Sunday to reopen elementary schools while keeping upper grades closed, and other districts around the country have made or announced similar moves.
Allowing schools to remain open has been one of the most significant departures from Europe’s initial lockdowns last spring.
“The first lockdown was horrible,” said Marine Huguenin, who was watching her two daughters play at a Paris park, which was filled with strollers and masked parents after school on a recent afternoon.
During the earlier lockdown, the entire family was stuck inside, she said, with Huguenin and her husband looking after their children during the day, then catching up on work between 9:30 p.m. and 1 a.m.
The numbers tell the story of France’s progress so far. In early November, the number of new cases in France in a seven-day period soared to more than 80 per 100,000 people; as of Sunday it had dropped to 17 per 100,000.
“Obviously, the decline has been slower because schools are open, but we had to find a middle ground,” said Yazdan Yazdanpanah, an infectious disease specialist and a member of France’s Scientific Council, which advises the government on the pandemic. But, he added, the slower drop in infections has been offset by positive effects on education, mental health and the economy.
The trade-off has been generally well-accepted in an otherwise contentious lockdown during which an increasing number of people have challenged restrictions on movement and business.
In Paris, keeping schools open has shifted the mood in a city that lived through one of the world’s strictest lockdowns in the spring.
At the time, Paris felt like a ghost town, with every inch of the city — from small residential streets to the Champs-Élysées — deserted. This time, things seem much nearer to normal. Chairs are stacked inside closed cafes and restaurants. But neighborhoods come to life in the mornings and afternoons as parents take their children to and from school, and older students linger on sidewalks with studied indifference.
Clusters have appeared in schools throughout France, though not in “worrying numbers,” said Yazdanpanah, the infectious disease specialist.
With classrooms open, parents have been able to focus on work at home or commute to their workplaces, which has helped blunt the second lockdown’s blow to the economy.
The Bank of France estimated that economic activity this month would be 12% below normal — far less than the 31% drop experienced in April.
Most European countries, including Britain, France, Germany and Spain, have kept schools open even as the continent remains among the worst-hit. A few countries, like Austria, the Czech Republic and Italy, have closed schools, in part or in full.
In France, as in much of the world, schools shut down during the first wave in the spring as scientists tried to figure out what role children played in transmitting the virus.
The country’s 12 million students in primary and secondary schools engaged in online learning, but soon, teachers and education officials warned that many children had fallen behind.
“It reinforced our conviction to keep the schools open, for education and social reasons,” said Sophie Vénétitay, a teacher and union official.
Meanwhile, new studies suggested that despite early fears, keeping schools open, while not without risk, could be relatively safe so long as rules to limit the spread of the virus were in place.
In August, a report released by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said evidence “indicates that closures of child care and educational institutions are unlikely to be an effective single control measure for community transmission of COVID-19.”
Most studies on transmission now suggest that children younger than 10 spread the virus less efficiently than adults do, but that teenagers become infected and spread the virus just as much as adults. So keeping high schools open safely is trickier, especially if community transmission is high — making social distancing rules even more important.
After reining in the first wave of the epidemic, France saw infections begin rising again in August as people resumed socializing and the government failed to effectively carry out public health measures of testing, tracing and isolating.
By October, infections were skyrocketing across most of Europe.
But even after a warning from his scientific advisers, President Emmanuel Macron announced that France’s schools would remain open, as nonessential businesses were ordered closed. “Our children cannot be permanently deprived of instruction, education, contact with the school system,” he said.
Henri Bergeron, a sociologist at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, the elite university known as Sciences Po, and a co-author of a book, “Covid-19: An Organizational Crisis,” said: “This time, health priority is mixed with economic priority.”
To address concerns as cases ballooned, education officials slightly tightened rules, including lowering the age for mandatory mask-wearing to 6 years old from 11. Many schools staggered hours for parents to drop off and pick up their children, and have adjusted lunch periods to lessen crowding. In many high schools, students now take turns, spending half their days in school and the rest at home.
Three months into France’s school year, schools have not become a major driver of infections, according to health experts And the number of students who tested positive in the seven days that ended Thursday dropped 44% from the week before, according to figures released by the Education Ministry. The latest figure translates to 0.06% of the 12 million schoolchildren in France.
On Friday, out of 61,500 schools nationwide, only 19 primary schools, three middle schools and three high schools were closed because of outbreaks.
Outside Turgot High School in Paris, small groups of students chatted and smoked after the end of their classes on a recent afternoon. Some said they thought students were being infected outside school, when they met on weekends, sometimes at classmates’ parties.
Jeanne Piffaut, 17, said she found it hard studying alone and being unable to ask her teachers questions in person.
“I’m worried that the situation will get worse,” she said, “and that schools end up closing.”

A Florida man who had been reported missing at sea was found clinging to his capsized boat Sunday morning about 86 miles off the coast of Port Canaveral, officials said.
Sometime after midnight Sunday, the man, Stuart Bee, was asleep on his 32-foot Sea Ray, called the Sting Ray, when he was abruptly awakened by water rushing into the front cabin of the boat, said Petty Officer 1st Class David Micallef, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard.
The boat “filled up with water almost immediately,” Micallef said, adding that the vessel quickly capsized and that the force of the water “pushed him out of the front hatch.”
For hours, Bee, 62, clung to 4 feet of the boat’s bow that was above water. Then, after sunrise, Bee noticed a ship in the distance, so he took his shirt off and started waving it to get the crew’s attention. He lost his glasses in the process.
Crew members on Angeles, a 225-meter Liberian container ship en route to Wilmington, Delaware, saw Bee around 11 a.m. and got close enough to throw him a life ring used to pull him to a ladder to bring him aboard the ship.
Rather than have the Coast Guard pick him up, Bee decided to stay on board the Angeles, which is scheduled to arrive in Wilmington on Tuesday.
“He’s just excited to be alive,” Micallef said. “I think he’s in good spirits.”
Bee left Cape Marina in Port Canaveral on Friday for what was meant to be a short cruise on the water. He apparently decided to sleep overnight on the boat, which was not typical, according to a marina employee. He was reported missing by the marina and his brother the next day, Micallef said.
The Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs and Border patrol both dispatched aircraft and asked boats in the area to keep an eye out for Bee.
After his first night on the water, Bee told the Coast Guard, his boat became disabled after a mechanical failure Saturday, which he tried and failed to fix himself, Micallef said. The Coast Guard did not receive any radio transmissions from him seeking help.
“This case, honestly, it’s an incredible outcome,” Micallef said. “I think it demonstrates the strong ties that the maritime community has with one another. We’re thankful that he’s going to be able to be on dry land soon.”

In early February, things were looking good for Practice San Francisco, a center offering individual psychotherapy and classes for children and adults that promote physical and mental well-being. Business was so good that owner Nina Kaiser, a psychologist, had just renovated and moved into a bigger space with the goal of doubling revenue.
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit. In early March, Kaiser moved all her classes and counseling services online. Fairly quickly, however, video fatigue set in.
“After a few weeks, we saw a big downturn in attendance across all our programs, even psychotherapy,” she said. Thus began a period of “endless pivoting and troubleshooting.”
Like many other small businesses, Practice San Francisco, which has been around for three years, has essentially become a startup again, employing a strategy similar to the “fail fast” approach well known in startup culture: A change is made to some aspect of the business and if it works, it sticks, but if it fails, data is collected and something else is tried.
“There has been a lot of flying by the seat of your pants,” Kaiser said. “We see what doesn’t work, where we run into trouble, and we course-correct. It’s this constant, iterative process.”
That process is crucial right now for small businesses, whose numbers dropped by 22% — 3.3 million — between February and April, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
With Practice San Francisco’s classes being delivered remotely, Kaiser partnered with a local yoga studio to offer joint programming, increasing both businesses’ visibility and revenue. It worked for a few months and then became problematic.
“It wound up being more difficult than I anticipated to combine two communities with different expectations,” she said. Enter the fail-fast approach: The collaboration has been paused and is being reconfigured.
After that, Kaiser decided to change her class model from drop-in to series-based, keeping a cohort of students together for an entire series.
“That builds relationships within the class,” she said. “We are now intentionally focused on building community.”
Attendance went from one or two people per class to between eight and 15. And once it became clear the pandemic would not be short, demand for remote psychotherapy began increasing.
Despite the pandemic-related challenges, Kaiser projects that 2020 revenue will be up 50%.
The Greater Knead, a gluten-and-allergen-free bagel company in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, also was poised for a good year in 2020. The 8-year-old company, whose bagels are sold in bagel shops and supermarkets, had finally turned a profit, with just under $1 million in revenue. In February, sales were up 20%, and the business was on track to have its best year yet, said the owner, Michelle Carfagno.
But in early March, sales dropped steeply, as stores closed and customers stayed home. Supermarkets began running out of Greater Knead bagels and didn’t reorder, focused instead on stocking items like toilet paper and cleaning supplies. By May, revenue was down 60%. A small bright spot, however, was internet sales, which were slowly increasing. Carfagno decided to capitalize on that and invested in social media advertising, something she had not done before, to drive traffic to her website. Now that people were staying home, they were seeking the Greater Knead’s bagels online, and she wanted to make sure they could find them.
“Before the pandemic people learned of us through word of mouth, store signage and in-store demonstrations,” she said. “All of that was gone.”
Soon after, Carfagno decided to work with a West Coast fulfillment center, enabling her to ship nationwide, something she had not considered before because of the high cost of shipping frozen bagels. It turned out to be a smart move: By September, online sales were up 250%.
“We now see this as an opportunity to have a direct relationship with customers,” Carfagno said.
She abandoned a planned move this fall to a bigger facility and decided instead to change the layout of her manufacturing space to increase efficiency. She also invested in automation, purchasing a state-of-the-art bagel-making machine as well as a packaging machine, which will vacuum-seal the bagels, eliminating the need to freeze them for shipping. Carfagno projects that revenue for 2020 will be 5% higher than last year. It’s not the 20% to 30% she had expected, but the changes she has made — and will keep making — have helped her in ways she hadn’t anticipated.
“We are so much more efficient now,” she said. “And because we have consumers buying directly from us, it’s much lower cost to launch a new product. We are looking at other things we could be selling, possibly a whole line of gluten-free baked goods.”
Anthony Casalena, founder and chief executive of Squarespace, a website building and hosting company with more than 2.5 million customers, the majority of which are small businesses, sees an increasing willingness among these businesses to try new strategies, including fostering a more direct online relationship with their customers.
“Companies creating new websites on our platform, and email marketing campaigns, are at an all-time high,” he said. “And e-commerce sales on our platform have doubled.”
Before the pandemic, Seattle-based Snapbar, which created custom selfie stations and photo booths for events, was the kind of company that did business over the phone and in person. Its staff members in five cities would set up “luxe photo booths” at events like weddings and charitable galas. Snapbar also shipped “selfie stands” — easy-to-set-up photo booths that use an LED light and an iPad — for use at sporting and corporate events. At the start of 2020, the 8-year-old company was on track to more than double its 2019 revenue, which was $3.2 million.
But by mid-March, Snapbar had lost all its business, and operating remotely was not an option. During a night of panicked insomnia, Sam Eitzen, co-founder and chief executive, came up with 50 ideas for “pivots, changes, adaptations and reinventions.” Eventually he and his brother and co-founder, Joe Eitzen, settled on Keep Your City Smiling, a direct-to-consumer site that would sell gift boxes filled with items from local small businesses in a particular city.
“We didn’t rebrand ourselves or shut down Snapbar; we just built something new,” Sam Eitzen said.
In its first three months, Keep Your City Smiling earned $500,000 in revenue, with 50% to 60% going back to the small businesses whose products were included in each box. But as the pandemic wore on, orders plummeted and Eitzen shifted its focus again, this time from consumer to corporate gift giving. That enabled Keep Your City Smiling to stay afloat, but it did not generate enough revenue to sustain Snapbar.
During this period, however, Snapbar’s director of engineering had been intensely working on developing a product he believed could save the company: a virtual photo booth.
“Most corporate virtual events feel like lectures or webinars,” Sam Eitzen said. “We create a custom-designed and branded photo booth that lives in a link on the event’s site. So an attendee is still consuming information, but they can also engage in another way, taking a selfie at the event and posting it on Instagram.”
This pivot transformed Snapbar into a tech company. The virtual photo booth is now the fastest-growing product it has ever had. And revenue — after the company nearly went under — is projected to be $2 million this year.
“My brother and I really struggled with this big question,” Sam Eitzen said. “After eight years of working so hard, is it better for us to put all of our savings on the line again, or do we cut our losses and let the team go? But we really love the people we work with. And that’s why we stayed in it.”

Warning that New York had entered a “new phase in the war against COVID,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that the state will implement a barrage of new emergency actions, some of which echo the strict measures taken this spring, to stem a rising tide of infections and deaths.
Cuomo said that the strength of the virus’s second wave has forced the state to rely less on test positivity rates as the determinant for restrictions and focus more on hospital capacity. On Monday, the governor announced that hospitalizations topped 3,500 over the weekend, a level not seen since May.
The governor said if hospitals become overwhelmed, he could impose a regionally based shutdown, or “pause” order, as he did statewide in the spring. He also asked hospitals to begin identifying retired doctors and nurses to help staff medical facilities, where he said burnout was an increasingly common problem.
The governor said he wanted to prevent the conditions that led to Elmhurst Hospital in Queens being inundated by coronavirus patients this spring, with beds filled, doctors overworked and refrigerated trucks posted outside to hold the dead.
“We are not going to live through the nightmare of overwhelmed hospitals again,” Cuomo said during a briefing in Manhattan.
Cuomo said that he would ask hospitals to increase the number of beds by 50%, and hospital chains to evaluate where there was capacity inside those systems, to help redistribute patients where there was availability.
Plans for field hospitals were being dusted off, the governor said, adding that capacity would also be evaluated between hospitals in different parts of the state, an idea known as “surge-and-flex,” another measure the governor implemented in the spring.
Similarly, Cuomo also announced that he was ordering hospitals to stop elective surgery in Erie County, in western New York, which is enduring the highest weekly positive test rates in the state. The county led the state in number of deaths reported Monday.
Despite rising rates of infection, Cuomo has resisted implementing the kind of widespread shutdowns seen in March, when hundreds of New Yorkers began to die every week, and much of New York’s economic activity ground to a complete halt.
Rather, Cuomo’s strategy has been to utilize targeted restrictions on individual areas — known as his “micro-cluster initiative” — which has now expanded to nearly 30 locations around the state, including in all five boroughs of New York City, its suburban counties, and major upstate population centers.
The announcement Monday came after weeks of steadily more worrying news in New York. The state’s daily rate of positive tests Sunday topped 4% for the first time since May, and the number of more serious cases continued to grow. The positivity rate was reported to be 4.57% Monday.
The death toll has also started to rise again: On Monday, the governor said 54 deaths were reported by the state. All told, almost 1,000 people died in New York this month, according to The New York Times’ tally, making November the deadliest month since June. The state has suffered more than 34,000 deaths since the discovery of the first case in March 1, the most of any state.
In his remarks Monday, Cuomo noted that the current surge of cases has been more widespread than in the spring, when cases and deaths were largely concentrated in New York City and its suburbs.
He recalled how some upstate regions sent reinforcements and resources to downstate medical facilities in the spring and suggested that would be difficult now. “Every region is dealing with a hospital issue,” he said.
Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has been touting the state’s response to the crisis for months, releasing a book in October about “leadership lessons” drawn from his experiences. The governor has also repeatedly made a point of saying that New York is doing well in comparison with other states.
On Sunday, however, the governor seemed to modify his thinking on that point somewhat, saying, while “it’s nice that we’re doing better in a national context,” it is also “irrelevant.”
“Because we have to deal with the issues that we have here in New York relative to New York, right?” Cuomo said.
Cuomo praised efforts by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who appeared at the news conference via Zoom, to reopen elementary schools, while voicing broader support for plans to keep students in kindergarten through eighth grade in classrooms.
The city will no longer use a 3% test positivity threshold that it had adopted for closing the school system; instead, the city will increase testing in schools and close those that have multiple confirmed virus cases.
And with the state’s daily positivity rate now above 4%, Cuomo — seemingly aware of how relying solely on rising infection rates could lead to economically detrimental shutdowns — had been indicating that a statewide shift in strategy was coming.
On Monday, the governor said new metrics — including hospitalization rates, death and case rates, and available hospital beds — would be used to determine lockdown levels under the “micro-cluster” strategy, the state’s color-coded restriction system. Cuomo said those new numbers will be set this week, after the state evaluates the effects of people congregating during last week’s Thanksgiving holiday.
“I don’t believe we’ve seen the hit from Thanksgiving,” he said, adding that he believed the increase in cases “will be dramatic.”
It’s still unclear how the governor will reconcile positivity rates and hospital metrics to determine new restrictions, but state officials said homing in on hospitalizations was a useful way to determine the severity of the disease in any given location. There are areas in the state where the number of people testing positive has increased, for example, but hospitalizations have not, lessening the urgency for new restrictions there, officials said.
With Cuomo ordering the redistribution of patients across hospitals, the state plans to track hospitalizations by a patient’s home address, not only where the person is hospitalized, to better ascertain which parts of the state are driving hospital admissions.
Officials said that the governor’s renewed focus on hospital capacity, harkening back to the grim projections of overrun hospitals in the spring, is a deliberate tactic to underscore the severity of the situation and prompt citizens to behave responsibly.
Indeed, Cuomo predicted that the rates of infection would continue to rise through December and into January, while still expressing confidence that the state could withstand the second wave.
State officials believe a majority of new cases in the state stem from small gatherings in homes, with people increasingly congregating indoors as temperatures drop, rather than in public settings like bars and restaurants. Changing that behavior, the governor said, would require a robust public messaging campaign similar to the one employed around mask wearing.
“It is all in our control,” Cuomo said.

‘Bleak Friday’ for Stores as Pandemic Pushes Holiday Shopping Online

The 2020 edition of Black Friday did not offer the usual scenes of bustling stores and shoppers lined up outside discount chains and electronics retailers. Instead, most people bought online, if they bought at all.
Crowds at malls and city shopping districts were relatively sparse over the holiday weekend in the face of rising coronavirus cases and warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid large groups. Major chains closed on Thanksgiving, after years of being open that day. And many Americans did their shopping before the weekend even began, drawn by sales that began in October.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that retailers’ overall Black Friday sales fell 20% from last year, based on early reports of drops in store foot traffic and increases in online sales. Consumers spent $9 billion online Friday, a 21.6% increase from last year and the second-biggest figure for online retailers ever, according to Adobe Analytics, which scans 80% of online transactions across the top 100 U.S. web retailers. The firm said online sales rose to $23.5 billion in the four-day Thanksgiving-to-Sunday period, up 23% from last year.
“This wasn’t a Black Friday, it was a bleak Friday in stores,” said David Bassuk, global co-head of the retail practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. “It is such a stark contrast to past years. The stores were really ghost towns.”
The early results from the weekend, which has traditionally kicked off holiday shopping in the United States, show how the season is being upended by the pandemic. Major retailers started offering deals well before Halloween, a shift that was amplified by Amazon’s decision to hold its annual Prime Day event in the middle of October. Consumers have been encouraged to shop early to avoid shipping delays. Chains have replicated deals once limited to stores on their websites and canceled visits with Santa Claus to minimize crowds.
Americans were already spending online before the pandemic, but the crisis has accelerated the trend. About 59% of shoppers had started their holiday shopping by early November this year, the National Retail Federation estimated. Shopper foot traffic declined by 52% on Friday, according to data from Sensormatic Solutions.
“The ability to pull the holiday forward may linger with us,” said Simeon Siegel, a retail analyst at BMO Capital Markets. “It’s been a long time since Black Friday was simply three hours in the morning on Friday. Black Friday was already stretched into early November, it just happened to make it into October as well.”
During earnings calls in November, several retail executives said they were uncertain about how much holiday shopping had actually been done in October and early November. Matthew Bilunas, chief financial officer at Best Buy, said “it’s really difficult to predict exactly how much was pulled into” the third quarter.
Most retailers operate on a calendar where the fourth quarter starts in November and ends in January, in part to fully capture the holiday shopping season.
“We think it’s going to be a prolonged shopping season,” Brian Cornell, chief executive of Target, said on a separate call. “We’re going to see very different shopping patterns. We don’t expect to see those big spikes during Black Friday and on weekends.”
Sales on Monday — known as Cyber Monday since it was concocted in 2005 — are expected to exceed those on Friday.
But while consumers have flocked to deals online, Siegel said many retailers had carefully managed inventory and promotions and were largely holding the line on prices compared with 2019.
“People have become accustomed to doorbusters and ever-deeper promotions,” he said. “The reality is at most companies, the headline promotions are, at most, flat to last year.”
The bigger question for retailers is how the jump in online sales may eat into their profits, since they have to spend additional money on shipping and processing returns. Black Friday was traditionally considered the day that retailers went from being in the red to becoming profitable, or in the black, for the year.
“The idea of retailers moving into the black on Black Friday has also evaporated,” said Bassuk of Alix Partners. “Yes, there is more volume, but as that volume shifts to online, it becomes more costly for the retailers.”
While the number of shoppers visiting just about every store on Black Friday was down markedly from previous years, those who did venture out were not there to window-shop.
Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research firm, said retailers experienced higher “conversion” rates, meaning more shoppers in the stores actually made purchases than in previous years.
“This is a trend we’re expected to see at this COVID Christmas,” Johnson said in an email.
While the results of this year have prompted some experts to portend the death of Black Friday, Siegel is among analysts who view 2020 as an outlier, anticipating that shoppers will return to stores once they feel it is safe to do so.
“The pandemic will leave us with a lot of new traditions but it’s not going to wipe away all of the prior,” he said.
The rest of the holiday shopping season will be closely watched as a barometer for the U.S. economy. Millions of people are still out of work or have been forced into part-time employment. Overall consumer spending, which drives as much as two-thirds of economic activity, has slowed in recent months along with the expiration of some emergency government spending programs.

Texto completo: Miller, Sarah Bryan Sarah Bryan Miller died on November 28, 2020, after battling breast cancer for more than ten years.
Bryan (as she was always called) was born in Kansas City, Missouri, the daughter of Thomas Wade Hampton Miller III and Eleanor Cosens "Dolly" Simons Miller. She grew up in Prairie Village, Kansas. The family relocated to the Chicago area in 1967, and she graduated from John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois. In 1974, she graduated from Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin with a BA in English and history. She also studied voice while at Carthage College, and upon graduation she took a job as a member of the chorus at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. While there, she participated in the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists for three years; she also sang several featured roles, including that of Cherubino in Chicago Opera Theater's first production of Mozart's Marriage of Figaro in 1975.
In the mid-1980s, while still singing with the Lyric Opera, Bryan began writing feature articles for the Wednesday Journal of Oak Park and River Forest, the Chicago Reader, and the Chicago Tribune. She also wrote a weekly column on classical music for AOL. A music critic with the New York Times took notice of her writing, and she became a regular contributor to both the New York Times, writing on classical music, and the Wall Street Journal, writing on a variety of topics.
In 1998, Bryan left the Lyric Opera chorus and relocated to St. Louis to become the classical music critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. She reviewed hundreds of orchestral, choral, and opera performances in the St. Louis area. She also accompanied the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra on tours to Europe and within the United States. In 2001, Bryan was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize for her reporting on the financial difficulties of the SLSO. In 2019, she was honored as one of the St. Louis Press Club's Media Persons of the Year.
Bryan was a panelist on the Metropolitan Opera quiz, broadcast worldwide during the Met's Saturday matinee radio programs, for six seasons beginning in 1999. She was an honors graduate of the Episcopal School for Ministry in St. Louis. In 2019, a setting of Psalm 121, written by noted English composer Judith Bingham, was commissioned in Bryan's honor by a consortium of six St. Louis choirs.
Bryan is survived by her daughters, Louisa B. Rix and Eleanor M. Rix; her brother, Thomas Wade Hampton Miller IV (Lynn); her nephew, Thomas Wade Hampton Miller V; and her niece, Celia J. Miller (Bill Forsko).
The inurnment service will be private; a public memorial service will be held at a later date. In lieu of flowers, it is requested that donations be made to the music fund of St. Peter's Episcopal Church, Ladue; Opera Theatre of St. Louis; or the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra.

Keep the Biden honeymoon phase short

Texto completo: In case you missed it: A cat will be joining President-elect Joe Biden's two pet German Shepherds — Champ and Major, a shelter rescue dog — in the White House.
Meanwhile, in other transition news, Rahm Emanuel remains in the running for secretary of transportation, as Biden weighs the former Chicago mayor's infrastructure resumé against his record of covering up the murder of a Black teenager by a white police officer. According to the New York Times, ethical issues could entangle some of Biden's closest advisers and others under consideration for high-ranking administration posts. And so far, Biden's pleas for national unity are not winning over Republicans or, for that matter, Democrats.
For now, Biden is basking in the happy honeymoon phase of media coverage. Even a hairline fracture to his foot was cast in glowing light — the result of engaging “in one of the most presidential acts of performative vigor — playing around with his dog,” as Slate put it. But the gushing, facetious or not, can't last forever, right? There are serious issues for the press to cover. How Biden delivers for Black voters who helped him win election is one, along with potential conflicts of interest within the incoming administration and Biden's ability to deliver on his gauzy promise that somehow we can all get along.
President Trump's refusal to concede the election has helped to keep the Biden honeymoon going strong. The president's “Mad King George” act, as described to The Washington Post, kept the press fixated on his dangerous, Twitter-fueled campaign to undermine democracy. Republican senators who continue to humor Trump were also rightly called to account for their enabling and spineless conduct. Meanwhile, the judges and state officials who supported the will of the people over Trump's fantastical conspiracy theories became the warm and wonderful heroes of an unprecedented post-election story. It all benefits Biden.
But there should also be room for skeptical coverage of the president-elect. Last week, for example, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina said Biden is falling short when it comes to naming Black leaders to top positions. His words are significant given the role Clyburn played in helping to deliver the South Carolina primary vote to Biden when the nomination seemed destined for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. In an interview with Juan Williams, Clyburn said he was happy about Biden's selection of Linda Thomas-Greenfield to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations. But Clyburn, a force behind Biden's choice of Kamala Harris as his running mate, wants more diversity at the top.
Biden's consideration of Emanuel is a big problem. As my colleague Renée Graham has written, the former mayor and Obama White House chief of staff doesn't deserve a job in Biden's administration. Yet, according to an Axios report, he's still in the hunt, as resistance to his selection is cast as just another rift between progressive and centrist Democrats. It's so much more than that. Biden ran for president promising to restore the soul of the nation. That doesn't happen with Emanuel in his cabinet. There must be an available infrastructure expert who, unlike Emanuel, didn't hold up release of a video showing the police killing of a Black teenager to salvage his own mayoral reelection prospects.
The New York Times also raised potential conflict-of-interest issues connected to Antony J. Blinken, Biden's pick for secretary of state, and Avril Haines, his choice as director of national intelligence. They have ties to a consulting firm that helps companies with global interests game out Washington. Others in Biden's inner circle have ties to an investment fund with a particular interest in military contractors, the Times reports. The myriad conflicts of the Trump administration were rightly and aggressively pursued by the media; the same should happen with the Biden administration.
Biden's promise to get the coronavirus pandemic under control also needs an ongoing reality check — just like Trump's promise to build a wall at Mexico's expense.
As president, Trump labeled the press the enemy of the people, stoking hostilities his supporters embraced to a scary degree. That, plus the role the media played in 2016 to help Trump inflate the significance of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, led to some gentler coverage of Biden once he became the nominee. Now he's the president-elect. While it will be nice to have an animal lover in the White House, the press can't let serious scrutiny of the new administration go to the dogs.

Texto completo: Manish Arora was the breakout fashion star of India. Today, his business is in tatters, with a trail of debts. What happened?
In September, Manish Arora, a fashion designer once described as the "John Galliano of India," announced that he was creating a pop-up restaurant in Paris, his adopted hometown, for the Holi festival. An Instagram slide show, featuring the brightly colored maximalism that is the Indian designer's signature, depicted Mr. Arora with assorted friends sampling traditional Indian snacks.
Days later, he introduced a high-profile fashion collaboration with Amazon India, alongside three more of India's most celebrated designers: JJ Valaya, Ashish Soni and Suneet Varma. Mr. Arora is also currently a member of the advisory council for the International Woolmark Prize, one of the most prestigious fashion awards in the world.
At first blush, such ventures would seem like savvy lifestyle brand extensions for Mr. Arora, a former creative director of the French fashion house Paco Rabanne and the first Indian designer to make it big in Paris. His aesthetic defined Indian-fusion style for Westerners in the late aughts, with a riotous palette and Indian craft methods like embroidery and appliqué.
But Mr. Arora's brand partnerships, it turns out, seem to be more like belated attempts to save a business beset by years of chaos and financial troubles than an indication of success.
And his messy downfall has also been particularly disappointing for those who had hoped he would help bring international attention to the quieter but vital layers of the Indian fashion industry -- like the anonymous artisans (called karigars) who are responsible for much of the meticulous and beautiful handwork that goes into the garments.
"Fifteen years ago, Manish was almost seen like a god here for being the first Indian fashion designer to break into the global luxury market," said Sunil Sethi, the president of the Fashion Design Council of India. European high fashion, after all, is famously white and set in its ways, and until recently known more for appropriating ideas from other cultures rather than embracing and celebrating ethnically diverse designers and artisans.
"Big international brand names wanted to collaborate with him," Mr. Sethi said. "We were just so proud. And as the international fashion industry looked at Indian talent in a new light, we wondered whether more Indian designers would follow in his footsteps to the catwalks of Europe."
Instead, today, Mr. Arora's brand has been felled by business deals gone bad, unpaid wages lawsuits and vendor disputes that started at least three years ago, long before the coronavirus dealt the final blow. Earlier this year, Mr. Arora, who is in his late 40s, parted ways with his business partner of several decades, Deepak Bhagwani. Currently, the Manish Arora website is shut for maintenance.
The brand's last runway show, for spring 2020, was shown a year ago, and pieces that are available to buy are largely discounted, from past seasons and on sale via small, independent boutiques in the Middle East and Asia. The Manish Arora store in Paris has closed, and in messages seen by The New York Times, employees who asked the company about unpaid wages in October were told none would be forthcoming because the company was now in liquidation. According to Mr. Bhagwani, 43, the French holding company for Mr. Arora's Indian subsidiary went into liquidation in July.
Mr. Arora, reached by email in mid-October, declined to discuss the particulars of the situation. He said there was "acute disappointment" among all parties" and that he did not want to comment "on what went wrong given we are in liquidation and also the matter is in court."
"We expanded and hoped to reach the world with our unique sensibility and we tried. Sincerely," Mr. Arora wrote. "Unfortunately things went wrong. The markets shrunk. Expenses mounted and we soldiered on to the best of our capabilities."
For the moment, he added, he was "reassessing the way forward." That does not help, however, those he has left behind.
The Fashion Hope of India
Mr. Arora started out with big, global ambitions. But the same forces that have strangled other independent designer businesses -- chronic discounting from retailers, outrageously expensive fashion shows, overproduction of items nobody wanted -- also affected him. And instead of prioritizing responsibilities to longtime employees, it seemed Manish Arora management opted to chase profits and keep up appearances.
Then the pandemic began to ravage India's fashion industry. As Western retailers canceled orders and the Indian government abruptly locked down the country on March 24, Mr. Arora and his partners had started closing their business.
It also came at a time when consumer attitudes toward fashion businesses that fail to pay workers are changing -- and employees are increasingly willing to speak up, said Sanchita Banerjee Saxena, the executive director for the Institute for South Asia Studies at the University of California at Berkeley.
Historically, India's vast network of highly skilled embroiderers and leather workers has been overlooked compared with peers in France and Italy, despite decades of European luxury brands quietly sourcing work to India. Mr. Arora's success in the West was seen as a potential turning point for these karigars, an Urdu word that means "artisans."
"That never came to pass," Mr. Sethi said, who added that he never thought that spotlighting Indian heritage craft was a priority for Mr. Arora. "Under all the drama of Manish, frankly, that got lost."
Also tangled up in the mismanagement at Manish Arora were middle-class professionals in office jobs. In seven interviews with The New York Times, those professionals, along with karigars and vendors, all told a nearly identical story.
Mr. Arora founded his label in 2001 with his friend Mr. Bhagwani, who steered the finances. In 2005, Mr. Arora made his international debut in London. He became creative director of Paco Rabanne in 2011 and moved into a high-end apartment in Paris a year later. He produced two seasons for the brand before leaving to focus on his own label, which soon diversified into eyewear, home wear and cosmetics.
Beyond his flamboyant, critically acclaimed runway shows, Mr. Arora also received growing media attention thanks to high-profile collaborations with companies like Nespresso, Swarovski, Swatch and Reebok, a first for a homegrown Indian brand. From the start, he appeared to understand that his power lay in refashioning distinctively Indian aesthetics for white audiences.
"All Indian designers need to understand the fact that in order to excel in the international market, we all have to focus on the modernity of the garment and not on the Western look," Mr. Arora told the critic Suzy Menkes in 2009. "This means that we have to take Western ideas and use Indian sensibilities to make it a global product."
At its peak, Manish Arora was sold by retailers like Printemps, Yoox, Saks Fifth Avenue, Selfridges, Neiman Marcus and Galeries Lafayette. The Delhi-based production arm, incorporated as a separate company called Three Clothing Private Limited, employed 200 people.
Behind the Gilded Curtain
While Mr. Arora's business appeared to flourish abroad, however, it struggled to grow at home, according to former office staff and artisans. In 2012, the Indian fashion company Biba took a 51 percent stake in order to help Mr. Arora expand Indian by Manish Arora, which, among other lines, included a neon-colored couture bridal collection for the domestic market.
But former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared it would make it difficult to find future jobs, said that the move toward wedding collections, with a different type of clientele and lower prices, failed to excite Mr. Arora. Biba did not respond to an email requesting comment for this article.
By mid-2017, Indian by Manish Arora had shut down. According to Aftab Alam, 45, a master leather worker and former employee, and Omveer Singh, 40, who worked in accounting and marketing, it was also the year that everything started falling apart.
Partnerships with important stores started to dry up. According to Mr. Alam and Mr. Singh, employees began to be paid late, first by a few days, then a few weeks.
By the end of 2017, pay was delayed by two to three months, Mr. Alam and Mr. Singh said. Mr. Alam, who later went on to sue his employer for unpaid wages, described 18-hour days without overtime pay, adding that vendors, couriers and partners also stopped receiving timely payments. If they were paid at all.
According to Mr. Alam's suit, he "sent numerous reminders to the operational debtor and visited them personally at their office for settlement of outstanding dues."
His requests, say the lawsuit, "fell on deaf ears and nothing has been done to arrange for his legitimate dues, despite the operational debtor clearly admitting his liabilities towards outstanding dues."
In a response dated June 2019 and seen by The New York Times, the company said it didn't have the cash to pay Mr. Alam: "We are agreed to pay March and April 2019 salary, leave encashment and also his gratuity. But due to insufficient funds, we cannot currently pay this amount. We are trying to resolve it ASAP."
Unpaid interns began doing the work formerly handled by seasoned employees, like managing important photo shoots and production orders, as management struggled to balance the books and repay debts, according to a former intern, who declined to go on the record because they work in the Indian fashion industry.
"They owe a lot of money to us," said Jaf Jafri, owner of Brave Models, an Indian modeling agency that worked with Manish Arora for almost six years and took over the production of photo shoots after the brand closed its own studio. "I wrote them almost a hundred emails. No replies."
Former employees in India were told on Oct. 10 that the company was in liquidation. In an email, Mr. Bhagwani said he knew that there were vendors who were still owed money.
Empty Promises
Artisans and production workers unionized in 2016. But before office staff had been paid, former employees said, Mr. Arora would ask for money transfers to his personal account to pay for his vacations on top of his salary and the cost of his apartment and living expenses.
According to Mr. Alam, Mr. Arora also had the artisans make up to a dozen elaborate Burning Man outfits for him, a task Mr. Alam said took three artisans up to 20 days, at a time when they were still owed considerable sums for regular work and knew that the business was in trouble. In late 2017, Mr. Arora and Mr. Bhagwani left to go on their annual New Year's jaunt to Goa, a beachside party destination on the west coast of India, posting their exploits on their Instagram stories, which were watched by their employees. Salaries were several months late.
Mr. Arora denied that he asked for money transfers to his personal account to pay for vacations and living expenses, writing in an email: "For my part, I have never misused my position in the organization or wasted funds on personal expenses." In another email, Mr. Bhagwani said that employees were always paid, and the problems in 2016 and 2017 "might have been a small cash flow issue" related to the financial output required for runway shows.
In early 2018, the company stopped paying into the Provident Fund accounts, a compulsory retirement savings plan similar to Social Security, of at least a dozen employees. By that time, Intrend, a Chinese fashion holding company, and Gulshan Jhurani, an accountant whose bio on his website says he has experience in turning around troubled companies, had taken stakes in the Manish Arora business.
Intrend and Mr. Jhurani did not respond to emails requesting comment for this article.
In a video filmed and sent to The New York Times in August, 10 recently laid-off production workers said they were owed several months' wages, and have not had funds deposited in their Provident Accounts for two years, despite sending a signed notice to the Indian government asking for an investigation, also viewed by The Times.
All salary questions started being referred to Mr. Jhurani. "If you called Deepak, he would say to talk to Shivam in accounts," Mr. Alam told The Times. "Shivam would then say Gulshan will help. I would then again talk to Deepak and say that they are not doing anything. Then he will say talk to them again. I said, 'If you will do this, how will my wife and children survive?"'
The company's headquarters used to be in the industrial neighborhood of Noida, outside of Delhi, before it moved its offices and sampling studio to Dhan Mill, the poshest part of Delhi. In February 2018 the company hosted a lavish opening party.
Just days later, 15 employees including Mr. Alam stated their intention to quit unless they received what they were owed. When Mr. Alam left, in April 2019, he wasn't paid his back wages until December, after serving Manish Arora and Mr. Bhagwani with a lawsuit. Mr. Alam estimated he is still owed 263,000 rupees ( $ 3,570) for his legally required reward for long service and vacation days not taken, and that up to 20 former workers were also owed wages.
"I was the creative head and there were business heads who managed the rest, including money and administration," Mr. Arora wrote in the email he sent to The Times about Mr. Alam's situation and other claims by former employees. Mr. Arora declined to address specific issues but said he was "happy" to discuss "matters which I am aware of as a creative director." He did not respond to follow-up attempts to contact him.
Mr. Bhagwani said that the company had outsourced production in 2018 after receiving new investment, and paid off almost 200 workers' wages including Provident fund payments. Although he is no longer with the company, he confirmed there are workers who stayed after the consolidation with outstanding payments.
In January 2020, four months after the last Manish Arora show was hosted in Paris -- a celebration of L.G.B.T.Q.A.I. rights and "dreamers that defy dogma and definition," according to the show notes -- a lawyer for Mr. Jafri of Brave Models tried to serve a legal notice to partners. There was no one at the office or their homes to receive it, he said.
"Our lawyers said it would be a waste of money to continue," Mr. Jafri said, adding that he would have to spend more than half of the half a million rupees he was owed. "The lawyers told us they don't have assets, nothing."
'What Happened, We Do Not Know'
In his email to The Times, Mr. Arora said he was "taking time off to examine what I now want out of life and a career."
The next generation of Indian designers are producing wares that bear few of the hallmarks of Mr. Arora, with his neon hearts and sparkling stars. Some, like Rahul Mishra, have made the leap to Paris, and Ruchika Sachdeva of Bodice won the International Woolmark Prize in 2018.
But according to Supriya Dravid, an author and former editor in chief of Elle India, the designers behind Bodice -- and newer labels like Yavi, Two Point Two and Lovebirds -- are "creative pragmatists," with efforts directed toward slowly and steadily building the foundations of a global brand, and not necessarily a distinctively Indian one.
"Their goals are more about engaging with a newer, diverse community of global aesthetes," Ms. Dravid said. "It's about the power of the right kind of influence and how that might translate into commercial success."
Mr. Arora has defended the creative vision on which he made his name.
"People often call my work kitschy, which it isn't," Mr. Arora told Grazia India in July. "Kitsch refers to design in poor taste, often from another time, thereby questioning its relevance."
To his former employees, Mr. Arora became a dreamer who appeared to exist in a world as fantastical as the vivid dreams he put on the runway.
"When I was working with them all -- and with Manish -- he was a big international name," the former employee Mr. Singh said. "Now what happened, what they did, we do not know."

Texto completo: The reporter who broke the story of the cult for The New York Times thought he was done with Nxivm. But he couldn't resist seeing how "The Vow" and "Seduced" compared with his own experiences.
It was the comedian Judd Apatow who convinced me to invest a little too much of my time in the two recent documentaries about the sex cult Nxivm.
"The Vow" on HBO and "Seduced" on Starz have a combined running time of 13 hours. I make cameos in both shows as the reporter for The New York Times who in 2017 broke the story about Nxivm (pronounced Nex-e-um), and had fast forwarded through them to check out how good I looked. (Quite good, it turns out.)
The Nxivm story was bizarre and sickening. The group, which was based near Albany, N.Y., offered "self-improvement" courses, claiming they would help participants overcome fears and realize their potential. But Nxivm was a misogynistic, mind-control cult whose adherents referred to its leader, Keith Raniere, as "Vanguard," and where women who joined a secret sorority were branded with a symbol containing his initials. Over the past two years, several Nxivm officials have pleaded guilty to federal charges and Raniere, following his conviction for sex trafficking and other crimes, was recently sentenced to 120 years in prison.
I'd had my fill of Nxivm. But the documentaries have become pandemic TV hits and, given my role in them, plenty of people have offered me their opinions of the shows. They have included friends and acquaintances I wouldn't have expected to spend evenings absorbed by a sex cult. Then, my interest was further piqued when Apatow tweeted, "I may need to do a 300 hour podcast to explain why The Vow goes so much easier on the NXIVM cult than Seduced."
I decided to watch the documentaries more closely to see how their depictions of Nxivm jibed with my impressions. They struck me as starkly different from each other. "The Vow" resembles a crime show that follows several Nxivm defectors and the actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose daughter India became a member of the cult, in real time as they try to alert law enforcement authorities to its horrors. "Seduced," in which the Oxenbergs are the central characters, is a study of the coercive techniques used by cults and delves deeply into the abuse that Nxivm visited on its female members.
I watched "The Vow" first because I played a part in its story. I learned about Nxivm from the two filmmakers, Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, who would go on to direct the show. The couple had previously made "The Square," a well-received documentary about the Arab Spring, and we met in 2016 when they approached me about making a documentary based on a book I had written about a former FBI agent, Robert A. Levinson, who disappeared in Iran.
In mid-2017, they sent me urgent text messages asking if I was willing to speak with some people in grave danger. They put me in touch with Mark Vicente, a top lieutenant to Raniere, who had just left Nxivm after learning about the branding of women. Vicente then connected me with Catherine Oxenberg and several Nxivm defectors including his wife, Bonnie Piesse, Sarah Edmondson, a Canadian actress, and her husband.
They all provided me with critical information contained in the Times exposé of Nxivm and appear in the article. But back when I started reporting the story, I soon discovered that the tip from Noujaim and Amer hadn't been random. They were already following the experiences of the defectors with an eye toward making a documentary, and were apparently hopeful that I would be a character in it; namely, the intrepid reporter. They said they often had a journalist figure in their films. I told them that wasn't happening with me.
There is no question in my mind that Catherine Oxenberg and the defectors featured in "The Vow" were among the heroes who brought down Nxivm. And "The Vow" captures their anxieties and fears as they face threats of legal reprisals from the group and rejection by former friends who remain loyal to Raniere.
But while the documentary's vérité style offers intimacy, several defectors in the show are Hollywood types comfortable around a camera and seem at times to be playing to it. Also, in my first encounters with the film's characters, they stuck me as messier -- and in turn, more interesting -- than how they appear in "The Vow."
For instance, Vicente and Edmondson insisted during our first talks that Nxivm wasn't a cult but a self-improvement group that had somehow gone off the rails. And Vicente, a filmmaker who shot much of footage chronicling Raniere's reign that animates "The Vow," told me that he still wanted to promote a movie he had made that glorified Raniere's activities in Mexico. I told him I thought he was nuts.
The first season of "The Vow" also omits a piece of context about Vicente: Before joining Nxivm, he had been a devotee of another cult. One of the show's directors, Amer, said the issue will figure into one of several additional episodes of "The Vow" that will run on HBO next year. Those episodes will continue the show's chronological approach and focus on Raniere's trial and information disclosed during it, he said.
I came to "Seduced," with fresher eyes, though I was aware of some behind-the-scenes friction and competition between the shows. Initially, Catherine Oxenberg only took part in "The Vow," and India had no interest in talking about her experiences in Nxivm.
I never spoke with India while reporting on Nxivm. Back then, she was lost in the cult, and federal prosecutors might have indicted her along with other Raniere followers but for the relentless efforts of her mother. So I was surprised when I saw her positioned as the main character in "Seduced" -- she comes across as sane and chastised, a tribute to the healing powers of cult deprogramming for those who can afford it.
(Close watchers of the shows will notice that they only see India in "The Vow" in archival footage. The same is true for the appearances of Vicente an Edmondson in "Seduced.")
Overall, I would give "Seduced," which was created by Cecilia Peck and Inbal B. Lessner, the higher marks for clarity and brevity. The show's immediate portrayal of Raniere as an embodiment of misogynistic evil matched my impressions, and it quickly demolishes the delusion that Nxivm was successful. (The cult was financially propped up by two of its adherents, Clare and Sara Bronfman, heirs to the Seagram liquor fortune.) The show, however, struck me as a little too heavy on self-described "cult experts" and talking heads (which I guess includes me).
Critics have lauded both documentaries for highlighting how cults prey on the vulnerable. But cults don't exist in isolation, and neither show explored an area I had often wondered about: the ranks of enablers outside Nxivm -- lawyers, public officials and others -- who had unwittingly or otherwise shielded the group.
Soon after watching the shows, my wife and I were walking at dusk along a lovely country road when my cellphone rang and "Danielle Roberts" appeared on the caller ID. At first, the name didn't ring a bell. Then, I remembered that she was the physician and Nxivm member described in my first article about the cult as having used a cauterizing device to brand women.
Roberts had dodged my calls when I was working on the story. Now, she was calling me on the eve of Raniere's sentencing. She and other of the cult leader's remaining followers had proof, she said, that prosecutors had manufactured evidence against him. Roberts wanted me to immediately write an article for The Times about this supposed miscarriage of justice. I told her that I had retired from the newspaper and passed her along to a former colleague.
The next day, Raniere was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. That's a long time and, during the duration, I hope to never hear about Nxivm again.

Texto completo: Ari Roth founded Mosaic Theater Company after being fired by Theater J. He resigned under pressure after complaints from staff.
WASHINGTON -- After Ari Roth was fired six years ago by the Jewish theater he led here, where he had staged plays raising challenging questions about Israel, some of the nation's leading directors and dramatists rallied to his defense -- even as officials at the theater insisted that his dismissal had nothing to do with politics.
For his next act, Mr. Roth quickly founded the Mosaic Theater Company, a new company dedicated to principles of equity and diversity, which mounted works by such notable playwrights as Lynn Nottage, Jon Robin Baitz, Mona Mansour and Marcus Gardley, and rapidly attracted philanthropic support.
Now Mr. Roth is out again, resigning under pressure last week after a tumultuous period that began in June when staff members filed a written complaint alleging "yearslong" problems at Mosaic, and claiming that his leadership style followed patterns of "white supremacist behavior" -- a characterization he strongly disputes.
He left after taking a three-month sabbatical at the request of the theater's board members, receiving executive coaching and submitting a "Letter of Contrition" to his fellow staff members.
His ouster comes as theaters around the country, largely shut by the pandemic, are grappling with a series of complex issues. Many are trying to combat racial injustice in light of demands made by coalitions including "We See You, White American Theater." The #MeToo reckoning has led to renewed efforts to stamp out sexual harassment. And many companies are broadly reconsidering whether overbearing or even abusive management styles that were once tolerated are now unacceptable.
Discussing the complaints from the staff in a recent interview, Mr. Roth, 59, said, "some things were worth addressing and some were specious," adding that he believed the plan to get rid of him "must have been happening during the sabbatical."
The theater's board voted unanimously to accept his resignation last week during a Zoom meeting, said Bill Tompkins, its chairman. Mr. Roth read a lengthy statement at the meeting -- a version of which he has since posted on the website Medium -- complaining about being shunned at the theater he had founded.
"Ari Roth is a visionary," Mr. Tompkins wrote in a Nov. 25 letter to members of the Mosaic community that was obtained by The New York Times. "However, over the course of his tenure, he has proven ineffective at consistently supporting Mosaic's values with staff members, board members and artists."
The internal turmoil at Mosaic culminated with a 3,500-word staff complaint in June.
"There is a documented and well-known history of the complaints artists have brought against Mosaic leadership," read one bullet point. Another pointed to "public infighting" with the theater's managing director. A copy of the letter was obtained by The New York Times via an anonymous email account and Mr. Tompkins confirmed its authenticity.
In the recent interview, Mr. Roth denied some of the allegations that were made, including that he had adopted tokenist attitudes toward employees and performers of color, been disrespectful of women and blocked department heads from doing their jobs. Supporters of his said that a diverse range of people could vouch for his conduct.
In the introduction to the complaint, the staff members wrote: "We see white supremacy at work at Mosaic stemming from a Cis White Male leadership with unilateral decision making power who employ harmful tactics onto staff resulting in lost time, resources, money, as well as damage to the mental health of the staff."
"This is character assassination," Mr. Roth said.
But he acknowledged a series of disturbing incidents at Mosaic that have been cause for concern, including mishandling a sexual harassment complaint brought to his attention early in his tenure; dismissing a drunk actor at intermission; and awkwardly delivering critical notes to an all-female design team of one play.
The harassment complaint was made by an actress who said she had witnessed a playwright sexually harass and inappropriately touch one of her colleagues. In separate interviews, both actresses said that they were disappointed with how the situation was addressed; they said that Mr. Roth had merely banned the playwright from the theater's green room and did not take sufficient steps to protect their anonymity.
Mr. Roth admitted he mishandled the incident, saying that he had reacted "in a hurry" and with "insufficient training." In a later season, the actress who had brought forward the complaint asked for a sexual harassment policy to be read at the first rehearsal. It was not.
"We let her down twice," Mr. Roth said in the interview.
Kimberly Gilbert, an actress who served as the Actors' Equity union liaison for what she described as "a very fraught" production at Mosaic, said that Mr. Roth represented an older style of artistic director who gives instructions and expects his orders to be followed, even by a small, underpaid staff. "When work isn't done, he gets frustrated," she said.
"His defense is that the role of the artistic director has changed," she said. "But everything changes. Everything evolves. We just happen to be living in a time where this imaginary rule that an artistic director's actions will be tolerated by the people below -- that rule no longer exists, and we will call people out."
Mr. Tompkins, the board chairman, said that he did not see Mr. Roth as toxic or bullying. He said that dealing with "the good, the bad and the indifferent" is part of the artistic process. "Even I've been very mad at Ari sometimes," he said.
A former media executive, Mr. Tompkins joined the board at Mosaic in 2016, inspired by Mr. Roth's ideas and his work as a playwright. In an interview, he expressed regret that the fledgling theater was losing its founding artistic director, and reiterated his support for Mr. Roth's vision.
The deteriorating situation at Mosaic may underscore some of the challenges facing white men running theater companies dedicated to principles of equity, diversity and inclusion. Mr. Tompkins, who is Black, approved when Mosaic took up residence at the Atlas Performing Arts Center, located in a historically Black neighborhood far from other arts venues, and funders applauded that commitment.
Over five years, the new company's charitable contributions roughly quadrupled, to $ 2.3 million in 2018, with support from Bloomberg Philanthropies, the Reva and David Logan Foundation and the Weissberg Foundation.
Much of that grant funding was designated for diverse programming. Before the pandemic closed theaters nationwide, Mosaic was preparing to mount a trilogy of plays examining the life and legacy of Emmett Till, by Ifa Bayeza.
Mr. Roth's departure from Mosaic is his second high-profile exit from a Washington theater. In 2014 he was fired by Theater J, the theater at what is now called the Edlavitch DC Jewish Community Center, which he had led for 18 years.
Under Mr. Roth's leadership, Theater J grew in reputation. He was known for staging works that offered viewpoints from across from the Arab world. The playwright Tony Kushner and Oskar Eustis, the artistic director of the Public Theater in New York, were among those who opposed his ouster.
Officials at the Community Center said at the time that his dismissal was not in response to pressure from hawkish donors or a reflection of a reluctance to air critical views about Israel. "Ari Roth's dismissal was related to a pattern of insubordination, unprofessionalism and actions that no employer would ever sanction," Carole Zawatsky, the former chief executive office of the center, wrote in a letter in 2014 that was released to the media.
Mr. Roth continues to maintain that he was fired from Theater J for political reasons and said that he hoped to take one of his signature endeavors from both theaters, the Voices From a Changing Middle East Festival, with him, whatever he does next.
In a statement for the board, Mr. Tompkins wrote that he hoped the theater would emerge stronger than ever.
"While our stages may be dark," he said, "the work continues."

Texto completo: SEATTLE - Amazon has embarked on an extraordinary hiring binge this year, vacuuming up an average of 1,400 new workers a day and solidifying its power as online shopping becomes more entrenched in the coronavirus pandemic.
The hiring has taken place at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, at its hundreds of warehouses in rural communities and suburbs, and in countries such as India and Italy. Amazon added 427,300 employees between January and October, pushing its workforce to more than 1.2 million people globally, up more than 50% from a year ago. Its number of workers now approaches the entire population of Dallas.
The spree has accelerated since the onset of the pandemic, which has turbocharged Amazon's business and made it a winner of the crisis. Starting in July, the company brought on about 350,000 employees, or 2,800 a day. Most have been warehouse workers, but Amazon has also hired software engineers and hardware specialists to power enterprises such as cloud computing, streaming entertainment and devices, which have boomed in the pandemic.
The scale of hiring is even larger than it may seem because the numbers do not account for employee churn nor do they include the 100,000 temporary workers who have been recruited for the holiday shopping season. They also do not include what internal documents show as roughly500,000 delivery drivers, who are contractors and not direct Amazon employees.
Competitors - both with physical stores and online ones - are trying to figure out how to compete with Amazon on Black Friday and into what has traditionally been a busy endof-year sales period, but which has been upended by the pandemic. Amazon is dominant in e-commerce, where sales are expected to grow by as much as 30% over last year's holiday season, according to the National Retail Federation.
Amazon's rapid employee growth is unrivaled in the history of corporate America. It far outstrips the 230,000 employees that Walmart, the largest private employer with more than 2.2 million workers, added in a single year two decades ago. The closest comparisons are the hiring that entire industries carried out in wartime, such as shipbuilding during the early years of World War II or homebuilding after soldiers returned, economists and corporate historians said.
"It's hiring like mad," Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said of Amazon. "No American company has hired so many workers so quickly."
Even for a company that regularly sets new superlatives, Amazon's employee growth stands out as a stark illustration of its might. At this pace, it is on track to surpass Walmart within two years to become the world's largest private employer.
Its expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe have sounded the alarm over tech power. This month, European Union regulators brought antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing it of unfairly using its size and access to data to harm smaller merchants in its marketplace. Amazon has said merchants are thriving on its site, with their share of sales growing in the pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining the company, with President-elect Joe Biden expected to continue scrutinizing the tech giants.
"We are turning into Amazon nation," said Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington and a contributing New York Times opinion writer.
Having employees in nearly every state gives Amazon, which has warehouses around the country to be closer to customers, potentially outsize political leverage, O'Mara said. She added that history has shown there are risks when a region or country becomes too dependent on any one employer, although she said Amazon had not reached that point.

Trump's last mission: vandalize democracy

Texto completo: On Bill Clinton's Inauguration Day, Jan. 20,1993, he found on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway desk in the Oval Office a gracious, handwritten letter left for him by the Republican president whom he had defeated.
In it, the departing president reminded the arriving one:
"You will be our President when you read this note. I wish you well. I wish your family well. Your success now is our country's success. I am rooting hard for you. Good Luck - George."
In reflecting on how meaningful that letter had been to him, Clinton wrote of George H.W. Bush that "though he could be tough in a political fight, he was in it for the right reasons: People always came before politics, patriotism before partisanship."
That is why it was somewhat embarrassing that some members of the Clinton administration committed silly, immature acts of vandalism when handing the reins of power over to Bush's son, George W. Bush, in 2001.
The Government Accountability Office investigated the vandalism for a year and concluded that "damage, theft, vandalism and pranks did occur in the White House complex" during the transition, and as The New York Times reported: "The agency put the cost at $13,000 to $14,000, including $4,850 to replace computer keyboards, many with damaged or missing W keys."
It was embarrassing, but not truly disruptive to the transfer of power. Still, Republicans pointed to it as an extreme breach of protocol. Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, who had asked the GAO to look into the allegations of vandalism, said of the findings: "The Clinton administration treated the White House worse than college freshmen checking out of their dorm rooms." He continued, "They disgraced not just themselves but the institution and the office of the presidency as well."
I have thought about the grace of the elder Bush's transition letter and the smallness of the Clinton White House's shenanigans often in recent weeks as we have watched Donald Trump stubbornly refuse to concede, brazenly try to disenfranchise millions of voters and recklessly sow distrust in our electoral system, and by extension our democracy. Everything that happened before has been rendered quaint.
The way Trump has absolutely trashed our democratic norms has made a mockery of things that used to raise our, or at least Republicans', hackles about decorum and propriety - like Barack Obama not wearing a flag pin, putting his feet on a desk or wearing a tan suit. Republicans have either cheered or shrunk in silence as Trump has set his blazes and fanned the flames.
The damage Trump is now doing trying to claw back an election that he has lost is almost incalculable in its scope and yet-to-unfold possibilities. There is no guarantee that Trump will ever concede, and there is every suggestion that he won't. There is no way to know what a Biden Inauguration Day would look like. Would Trump attend? Would he gracefully exit the White House premises?
Furthermore, the damage Trump has attempted to do to faith in the American election system has been wildly, depressingly, successful. A Politico/Morning Consult poll earlier this month found that "70% of Republicans now say they don't believe the 2020 election was free and fair, a stark rise from the 35% of GOP voters who held similar beliefs before the election."
That would represent tens of millions of Americans who, largely because of Trump and the far-right press that abets him, will see a duly elected Joe Biden presidency as illegitimate, and the election system as flawed.
Furthermore, we have a president who appears to care about nothing else but turning his loss into a win, and, if he fails, handicapping the Biden administration.
He has essentially given up fighting the COVID crisis - other than touting vaccines - even though the virus is raging in this country and around the world. On Saturday, Trump skipped the "Pandemic Preparedness" meeting of G-20 leaders to play golf. As The Times reported, "at least 1,428 new coronavirus deaths and 171,980 new cases were reported in the United States" on Saturday.
Not only that, but as food insecurity triples for families with children during the COVID-19 pandemic, food bank lines stretch ahead of the holiday, and with 12 million Americans scheduled to lose unemployment benefits the day after Christmas, Trump is not pressuring congressional leaders to pass another aid package.
Remember that it was Trump who used a tweet to halt stimulus talks in early October, writing: "I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business."
He didn't win, and now he could care less. There is golf to be played. Trump is hurt but not humble. He is angry and lashing out.
I wish that all he and his team were doing was removing some B's and H's from some keyboards. Instead, they're taking a sledgehammer to a young and fragile democratic experiment and allowing Americans to suffer and die as they do it.

Liberals, conservatives struggle over American history education; Controversy at local high school highlights divide

Texto completo: As Maumee High School recently experienced, a tug of war is going on in the United States between liberal and conservative interpretations of American history - and opinions about how that history should be taught.

Take the pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving. It's a particularly timely example of the sorts of American stories that are being challenged by many academics and historians striving to tell a more nuanced version of the nation's defining moments, one that highlights the inequity, oppression, and violence that has largely defined the experience of people of color, women - and in the case of Thanksgiving - the Western Hemisphere's native populations.

Historians on the right, meanwhile, are gearing up to preserve teachings that many equate with American greatness - both historically and contemporarily.

An aspect of this push-and-pull recently surfaced in Maumee when district administrators amended the extra-credit assignments of a 10th-grade history class assignment after a parent raised concerns about right-wing bias in the material.

The material was provided by Prager University, a conservative nonprofit organization that uses digital media to promote a traditional perspective of American history and to fight what it characterizes as liberal and anti-American teachings. The group produces lectures, videos, and podcasts with names like Why I Left the Left, How Socialism Ruined My Country, Immigrants! Don't Support What You Fled, and War on Boys.

After pulling the PragerU extra credit opportunity, district leaders have vowed to form a committee that will better vet such content to determine if it has a place in the classroom. They've said the district strives to be an inclusive place, and prides itself on allowing students to freely raise concerns about what they're hearing in the classroom.

Marissa Streit, PragerU's chief executive officer, said the outrage caused by Maumee High School's use of PragerU's materials is a prime example of classroom polarization.

Conservatives and pro-American ideas are being attacked so much so that if someone even dares to bring it up, it immediately has to be canceled. We think it's incredibly dangerous and un-American, Ms. Streit said in an interview with The Blade.

Ms. Streit said civil discourse, in which students freely explore various points of view, is diminishing in American classrooms.

We believe in the good old saying, 'I may not agree with what you have to say, but I'm going to fight for your right to say it.' That saying is becoming an old and no longer an American saying because the left has had such a stronghold on America's education system, she said.

PragerU is not alone in attempting to change the way impressionable high school students think about the country they live in.

Liberals, represented by new efforts such as the New York Times' The 1619 Project, are working to acquaint students with the systemic oppression that has been part of American history since colonial days.

The project, published by the New York Times Magazine in both print and podcast form, challenges readers to think of 1619, the year enslaved Africans first landed on North American soil, as the nation's founding date. It delves into the depths of slavery and its impact on American history and present-day American life.

According to the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, a Washington-based nonprofit that is unaffiliated with the Pulitzer Prize, more than 500 schools received copies of the magazine dedicated to the project from the either Pulitzer Center or the New York Times during the 2019-2020 academic year, and more than 4,000 educators from all 50 states have included one or more resources from the Pulitzer Center's 1619 Project curriculum

In addition, educators nationwide have created their own lesson plans and activities including The 1619 Project as a source. The Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting provides lesson plans and reading guides based on The 1619 Project.

PragerU openly combats The 1619 Project. One of its five-minute videos is titled Expert Explains Why The 1619 Project Is Dangerous. The video's description says PragerU holds the position that the left rewrites history to fit their anti-American narrative.

For them to push this curriculum into our schools, at the very least allow our children to hear the other perspective. The demand we're making is that if you bring in 1619, you also bring in PragerU. We are not asking to only teach right-wing or conservative ideas, but a balance in education, Ms. Streit said.

She said that PragerU is launching a petition on its website to call for a balance in American education.

I'll put my money where my mouth is, she said. This is why we're launching another petition asking for balance in education. If they're teaching The 1619 Project and Black Lives Matter, they should also say, 'Hey, there's another perspective, and here's the other perspective,' and teach it without bias. A great way to teach it without bias is to show our videos.

Lee Strang, a University of Toledo law professor, said he believes communities should be able to decide if their teachers should utilize such supplemental materials.

It seems to me that one school district might say, 'We need an updated curriculum and the teachers are the ones to do it.' That's a reasonable decision depending on the circumstances, he said. You could have another school district that says, 'We spend so much time investigating which curriculum is the best for our students and families that we're sticking with this one and we're not supplementing or updating.'

Ruth Leonard, a Toledo educator and Black Lives Matter activist, said she has supplemented materials in her classroom and has no issue with them as long as they are unbiased.

In the past few years, I've been very intentional with my teaching, especially when it comes to American history, Ms. Leonard said. For example, with Thanksgiving, I always send my students home with the knowledge of the native tribes that existed before colonization, and we acknowledge that before we talk about Pilgrims and turkeys.

With 11 years of teaching primarily sixth, seventh, and eighth grades, Ms. Leonard said the issue of introducing a new curriculum into public-school history classes begins with a lack of resources at the state level.

When you look at the curriculum at a state level, that's where the problems start, I think, she said. I've gone through enough history books and have seen enough revisions to know that, when it comes to American history, there's not enough emphasis placed on the whole truth.

Ms. Leonard added that the lack of a viable curricula that encompasses American history in its totality causes teachers to improvise and include other resources.

That's how you end up with teachers who want to add their own perspectives into the curriculum, because it's simply not enough when you look at the curriculum -… even with The 1619 Project where it tells American history from the black perspective. It's also a perspective that is rarely taught, she said.

Ms. Leonard added that slavery in itself is only briefly mentioned in several curriculum.

I remember looking through history books when I first started teaching, and slavery could be anything from, 'Oh, there were sharecroppers and slavery was bad, and then Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves, Martin Luther King, Jr. came, the civil rights happened and now we're cool,' she said.

This depiction, she said, doesn't allow for a full nuanced understanding of the nation's history, and that in turn perpetuates cycles of inequality and oppression.

There's this desire to only share the good parts of American history, and that doesn't help anyone, she said.

Nancy Patterson, a professor of education and the social studies content-area coordinator at Bowling Green State University's College of Education, said it is imperative that Americans expand past their comfort zones when engaging in the study of their own history.

History is written and remembered by the winners, so we have to keep that in mind when we look at unique curriculums, she said. There's not one truth about history, and that's what makes it complex but also important for students to know that they can inquire about it as well.

Ms. Patterson said she believes resources like The 1619 Project are great additions to classrooms, especially when the nation is at a sort of crossroads regarding its moral and political values.

We can't have it be categorical as, 'This is what we see as true or false,' she said. I think communities of people have to decide what their values are and what's important... Who are we as a people? What is that we all believe to be true? It's a really important time in our history.

New York City to reopen elementary schools, removing positivity threshold

Texto completo: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said elementary schools will reopen despite the fact that the city crossed the mayor's 3% test positivity threshold earlier this month.
"Reopening our @NYCSchools buildings is paramount to recovering from #COVID19," de Blasio said in a Sunday tweet, announcing that he would open 3-K, pre-K, and K-5 schools beginning Dec. 7.
Tweet
District 75 schools, designed for children with disabilities who require intensive support such as those "on the autism spectrum and children with serious cognitive delays," will open on Dec. 10, according to the New York Times.
The mayor's plan involves a major revamp of how schools are managed during the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic continues to spread across the country at a record-breaking rate, infecting more than 4 million people in the United States in November alone. To date, more than 13 million people have tested positive for COVID-19 in the U.S., according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
One of the most notable changes is that de Blasio is abandoning the hybrid educational model of having students attend classes in-person for part of the week and virtually on other days. Students attending schools that have reopened will go to class five days a week. Schools will also undergo weekly testing upon their return to school, according to a tweet from the mayor.
Tweet
"Upon reopening, weekly #COVID19 testing will be in effect and testing consent forms will be required for our students to return," de Blasio tweeted. "Finally, as we reopen, wherever possible we will move to 5 day a week in-person learning. We want our kids in the classroom for as much time as possible. Our families do, too. We'll work to make it happen."
De Blasio faced widespread criticism earlier this month after New York City's daily positivity rate reached 3%, triggering the closure of public schools after less than two months. At the time, he said the closures would be temporary, and he has yet to determine when middle schools and high schools will reopen. De Blasio said that the reopenings will not be based on a positivity threshold, according to the New York Times.
New York has 1,800 schools serving over 1 million students. The majority of the students in the city's public schools are from low-income families and are black or Latino.
Schools across the country have reported that virtual learning has resulted in dramatic spikes in failing grades and truancy. In Fairfax County, Virginia, the percentage of failing grades had nearly doubled — hitting underserved communities and students with disabilities most severely.
The Economic Policy Institute emphasized that following the pandemic, a comprehensive plan to address educational disparities will be vital to getting children back on track, calling for increased funding and resources for public schools so that they can rebuild the educational system to focus on "nurturing the whole child ... ensuring that all children have access to the conditions and resources that enhance learning and development."
Photo Caption:New York Mayor Bill de Blasio puts on a mask during a news conference outside the Mosaic Pre-K Center on the first day of school, Monday, Sept. 21, 2020, in New York. New York, Seattle and Portland, three cities recently labeled "anarchist jurisdictions" by the U.S. Justice Department, filed a lawsuit Thursday, Oct. 22 to invalidate the designation and fight off the Trump administration's efforts to withhold federal dollars. According to New York City officials, as much as $12 billion in federal money affecting health, transportation and law enforcement programs could be at stake.

Officials say mysterious desert monolith in Utah disappeared

Texto completo: A strange sculpture situated in a remote area of Utah discovered earlier this month has disappeared, according to the Utah Bureau of Land Management.
"We have received credible reports that the illegally installed structure, referred to as the 'monolith' has been removed from Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public lands by an unknown party," the BLM wrote in an official statement. "The BLM did not remove the structure which is considered private property."
Facebook
The monolith, a three-sided statue made of metal with no engravings or writing of any kind, was seemingly first discovered on Nov. 18 while surveyors studied populations of bighorn sheep, according to the New York Times. It's unclear how long ago the structure was installed.
No one knows who placed the monolith, which required the use of precision tools to bore a triangular hole into the rock, or how it arrived at such a remote location, according to a spokesman for the Utah Department of Public Safety.
"Somebody took the time to use some type of concrete-cutting tool or something to really dig down, almost in the exact shape of the object, and embed it really well," Lt. Nick Street said. "It’s odd. There are roads close by, but to haul the materials to cut into the rock, and haul the metal, which is taller than 12 feet in sections — to do all that in that remote spot is definitely interesting."
Internet users joked that the monolith was placed by aliens, given its likeness to the Monolith featured in Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. The Department of Public Safety alluded to the internet joke in a statement about the sculpture being placed on public grounds. "It is illegal to install structures or art without authorization on federally managed public lands," the DPS wrote, "no matter what planet you're from."
Tweet
Officials speculated that the structure was the work of sculptor and science fiction aficionado John McCracken, who was known for creating minimalist sculptures. McCracken's son told the New York Times that his father said "he would like to leave his artwork in remote places to be discovered later."
However, even if McCracken created the monolith, he certainly did not remove it — McCracken died in 2011 at the age of 76.
The BLM added that the local sheriff's office would handle the investigation since the monolith was considered private property, even though it was placed on public grounds.
Photo Caption:This Nov. 18, 2020 photo provided by the Utah Department of Public Safety shows Utah state workers walking near a metal monolith in the ground in a remote area of red rock in Utah. The smooth, tall structure was found during a helicopter survey of bighorn sheep in southeastern Utah, officials said Monday. State workers from the Utah Department of Public Safety and Division of Wildlife Resources spotted the gleaming object from the air and landed nearby to check it out. The exact location is so remote that officials are not revealing it publicly, worried that people might get lost or stranded trying to find it and need to be rescued.

Paul Krugman: In praise of Janet Yellen the economist

Texto completo: It’s hard to overstate the enthusiasm among economists over Joe Biden’s selection of Janet Yellen as the next secretary of the Treasury. Some of this enthusiasm reflects the groundbreaking nature of her appointment. She won’t just be the first woman to hold the job; she’ll be the first person to have held all three of the traditional top U.S. policy positions in economics — chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, chair of the Federal Reserve and now Treasury secretary.
And yes, there’s a bit of payback for Donald Trump, who denied her a well-earned second term as Fed chair, reportedly in part because he thought she was too short.
But the good news about Yellen goes beyond her ridiculously distinguished career in public service. Before she held office, she was a serious researcher. And she was, in particular, one of the leading figures in an intellectual movement that helped save macroeconomics as a useful discipline when that usefulness was under both external and internal assault.
Before I get there, a word about Yellen’s time at the Federal Reserve, especially her time on the Fed’s board in the early 2010s, before she became chair.
At the time, the U.S. economy was slowly clawing its way back from the Great Recession — a recovery impeded, not incidentally, by Republicans in Congress who pretended to care about national debt and imposed spending cuts that significantly hurt economic growth. But spending wasn’t the only issue of debate; there were also fierce arguments about monetary policy.
Specifically, there were many people on the right condemning the Fed’s efforts to rescue the economy from the effects of the 2008 financial crisis. Among them, by the way, was Judy Shelton, the totally unqualified hack Trump is still trying to install on the Fed board, who warned in 2009 that the Fed’s actions would produce “ruinous inflation.” (Hint: They didn’t.)
Even within the Fed, there was a division between “hawks” worried about inflation and “doves” who insisted that inflation wasn’t a threat in a depressed economy, and that fighting the depression should take priority. Yellen was one of the leading doves — and a 2013 analysis by The Wall Street Journal found that she had been the most accurate forecaster among Fed policymakers.
Why did she get it right? Part of the answer, I’d argue, goes back to academic work she did in the 1980s.
At the time, as I’ve suggested, useful macroeconomics was under attack. What I mean by “useful macroeconomics” was the understanding, shared by economists from John Maynard Keynes to Milton Friedman, that monetary and fiscal policy could be used to fight recessions and reduce their economic and human toll.
This understanding didn’t fail the test of reality — on the contrary, the experience of the early 1980s strongly confirmed the predictions of basic macroeconomics.
But useful economics was under threat.
On one side, right-wing politicians turned away from reality-based economics in favor of crank doctrines, especially the claim that governments can conjure up miraculous growth by cutting taxes on the rich. On the other side, a significant number of economists themselves rejected any role for policy in fighting recessions, claiming that there would be no need for such a role if people were acting rationally in their own interests, and that economic analysis should always assume that people are rational.
Which is where Yellen came in; she was a prominent figure in the rise of “new Keynesian” economics, which rested on one key insight: People aren’t stupid, but they aren’t perfectly rational and self-interested. And even a bit of realism about human behavior restores the case for aggressive policies to fight recessions. In later work Yellen would show that labor market outcomes depend a lot not just on pure dollars-and-cents calculations, but also on perceptions of fairness.
All this may sound abstruse, but I can vouch from my own experience that this work had a huge impact on many young economists — basically giving them a license to be sensible.
And it seems to me that there’s a direct line from the disciplined realism of Yellen’s academic research to her success as a policymaker. She was always someone who understood the value of data and models. Indeed, rigorous thinking becomes more, not less important in crazy times like these, when past experience offers little guidance about what we should be doing. But she also never forgot that economics is about people, who aren’t the emotionless, hyperrational calculating machines economists sometimes wish they were.
Now, none of this means that things will necessarily go well. The race is not to the swift, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet success to policymakers of understanding, but time and chance happen to them all. Trump’s cabinet was a clown show — possibly the worst cabinet in America’s history — but it wasn’t until 2020 that the consequences of the administration’s incompetence became fully apparent.
Still, it’s immensely reassuring to know that economic policy will be made by someone who knows what she is doing.

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — The photographs of Sharon Chischilly capture the ravages of COVID-19 across the Navajo Nation.
A Navajo man stands in front of his home next to a hand-made sign reading “DUE TO COVID-19 ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS” A masked and gloved Miss Navajo hands out homemade face masks and hand sanitizer. A Biden/Harris supporter balances a political sign to protect her from the snow in front of the Navajo Nation Council Chamber in Window Rock, Arizona.
The Navajo Nation hit a single-day record of COVID-19 cases this month, with 383 people testing positive for the virus. The total number of confirmed COVID-19 fatalities reached 645 as of Nov. 27.
A University of New Mexico photography student, Chischilly grew up in Manuelito on the Navajo Nation. Her work has appeared in the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.
She recently received a grant through Santa Fe’s Obscura Gallery funded by the photographer Manuello Paganelli. His award-winning work has appeared in GQ, LIFE, Forbes, Newsweek, Time, Reader’s Digest and more.
Paganelli said he was impressed by the “maturity, seriousness and depth of her work.”
“I grew up with no running water as a kid,” Chischilly said in a telephone interview from Gallup.
My parents “would fill up buckets of water at the chapter house and bring them home. That was what we used to wash dishes and to wash my hair.”
Chischilly’s mother died when she was in high school. She is the youngest of four.
She encountered her first camera in 2018 at UNM-Gallup.
“It was a Canon AE-1 film camera for $20,” she said.
Chischilly learned how to operate it by herself and by watching YouTube videos.
Her introductory photography professor said her work resembled journalism.
“The way I like to take photographs – I like to document things, not posed photographs,” Chischilly said. “I like to go to events in Downtown Albuquerque.”
She photographed a celebration honoring the life of an Albuquerque skateboarder who had died.
“I started taking pictures of the flowers they left behind, or a skateboard in the shape of a cross,” she said.
At home, she photographed a Navajo code talker.
“It changed my life,” she said. “I knew that’s what I wanted to do.”
When the pandemic first hit, she hurried home, thinking she would be safer on the reservation than in the city.
“But it turns out the Navajo Nation was one of the highest – higher than New York City,” she said.
Between caring for her father, Chischilly shot pictures of the pandemic. At the time, she was working for UNM’s college paper, the Daily Lobo.
Her life changed again when she met a Washington Post reporter at a Navajo food distribution site.
“He asked me if the Post could use my photographs,” she said.
From there flowed a cascade of assignments from national newspapers.
“I started going to Window Rock,” she said. “Whenever I could, I looked at events like food distribution.”
“It really made me sad,” she continued. “Especially for a photojournalist, there’s codes of ethics, so I can’t help someone when I’m documenting it. You want to help, but you can’t let that get to you.”
Being Navajo gave her easier access, she acknowledged. But some residents didn’t believe her when she told them she worked for the New York Times. Others assumed she lived in New York. Once a (white) nurse refused to believe her employment until Chischilly showed her a letter from the paper.
“I’m not very fluent in Navajo,” she added. “When I meet someone, I say hi in Navajo to make them more comfortable.”
When her spring classes begin, Chischilly plans to continue her work on the reservation. She recently accepted a job offer with the Navajo Times.
“I really want to be a photographer for National Geographic,” she said. “I want to take photographs of different cultures and animals.”
She says she’s saving the $500 in grant money toward a better digital camera.

NEW YORK — Sheriff’s deputies arrived at a building in midtown Manhattan just before 3 a.m. Saturday and found almost 400 people drinking and partying inside. Few were wearing face masks.
Deputies shut the party down and arrested four people. The episode reflected the way that, despite the onset of a second wave of the coronavirus, people are continuing to gather at large events in New York City in violation of public health safeguards.
Sheriff Joseph Fucito said Sunday that his office has responded to similar events around twice every weekend for the last several months.
The frequency has not changed, he said, despite increasingly dire warnings from city officials about gathering indoors during the Thanksgiving weekend and the winter holidays.
Officials are having difficulty changing people’s behavior as the city enters a precarious phase of the pandemic.
The seven-day average test positivity rate in New York City was 3.9%, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday, up from less than 2% at the beginning of the month. About 720 people were hospitalized in the last seven days, according to city data, while the average for the last four weeks was 555.
Coronavirus case counts are breaking records nationwide. Federal health officials on Sunday forecast another spike in infections after Thanksgiving that could lead to more deaths and more stress on hospitals. Cold weather in the months ahead will continue to force people indoors and increase the risk of transmission.
Fucito declined to say how deputies found out about the party Saturday. But they arrived at the building at 202 W. 36th St. — about two blocks north of Pennsylvania Station — around 2:45 a.m. and found more than 393 people inside.
People had paid to attend the party and for alcohol service, but the organizers did not have a liquor license or permit to serve alcohol, Fucito said. Photos shared by the Sheriff’s Office show a room lit by a black light, with dozens of bottles of tequila, whiskey and vodka lining one counter.
Four people — the DJ and three others who worked at the party — were charged with violating rules meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Efforts to reach them Sunday were unsuccessful.
The party was just the latest in a string of large events that the Sheriff’s Office has responded to.
On Halloween weekend, deputies broke up two parties where almost 1,000 people were dancing and drinking inside warehouses. In mid-November, deputies shut down an unlicensed fight club, known as “Rumble in the Bronx,” which drew 200 people. Many of those crowding inside were drinking, smoking hookah and not wearing masks, authorities said.
Last weekend, deputies broke up a sex club party in Queens and an illegal party in Manhattan. And on Thanksgiving Day itself, deputies shut down an illegal bottle club in Queens with almost 80 people.
While the constant partying and violation of coronavirus rules seem at odds with the worsening situation in New York City, there are several explanations for why people would continue to embrace risky behavior, said Jay Van Bavel, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at New York University, who has written about how to align behavior with public health directives during the pandemic.
He said some people may increasingly be “suffering fatigue from lack of social interaction,” and younger people who tend to frequent parties may believe they are not at risk for severe health consequences.
He said misinformation may also dilute public officials’ warnings and lead people to believe the risks are not severe. With the Trump administration underplaying the risk of the virus, warnings get muddied, he said.
Meanwhile, the relative lack of financial support for struggling small businesses could drive people to search for other ways to make money, including through parties and other events.
“It manifests in all these little problems,” he said. “They all kind of pop up, and it’s like that game where you’ve got to smash the groundhog that pops up; you smash one down, and another one pops up.”

A self-driving motorcycle wouldn’t make much sense, but the industry is starting to adopt some safety technology from cars.
The first car with adaptive cruise control was the 1994 Mitsubishi Diamante. So why has it taken more than 25 years for the feature to appear on motorcycles? There were technical and ergonomic challenges, for starters, and some motorcyclists view it as a technological nanny or even an additional danger.
The feature is now familiar to many car drivers, but it represents a quantum change in the advanced rider assistance systems available on bikes. For the first time, motorcycles now invite riders to turn both throttle control and braking over to an onboard computer.
In October, Ducati announced that its 2021 V4 S model would come with adaptive cruise control. A week later, BMW announced that the feature would be available on its coming R1250RT. Next spring, riders will be able to let these motorcycles — using data from a forward-facing radar sensor — speed up and slow down on their own to match the flow of traffic.
The technology didn’t come easy to motorcycles. The hardware is a tricky fit on a handlebar, especially when buttons must be manipulated while wearing gloves. And adding even a few ounces to such high-performance machines is anathema to engineers and designers.
Because riders are not securely belted in position like car drivers, it’s important that they’re not thrown off balance when the motorcycle speeds up or slows down, especially if they’re already leaning into a corner.
Last but not least, many riders are philosophically opposed to ceding control; they enjoy the challenges and sensations of controlling their machine. Commuting by car is a chore for many drivers, so outsourcing a little control is welcome. But for motorcyclists, even riding in traffic is fun.
Ducati is owned by Audi, and BMW sells more cars than motorcycles, so both companies tapped years of automotive experience. Both worked closely with Bosch, which already had a suitable radar sensor, developed for use on compact cars. The two motorcycle makers’ systems are functionally similar but not identical. The most obvious difference is that Ducati’s front-facing radar is paired with an additional rear-facing sensor that provides blind-spot detection.
The hardware may be automotive, but the software is motorcycle-specific and took years to perfect.
“The physics of a motorbike are totally different,” said Reiner Fings, director of product development for BMW’s R series motorcycles. “The system must able to detect cars and other motorcycles while it is leaned over.”
That ability is only one of the differences. Many car systems work even in stop-and-go traffic, but because motorcycles don’t have automatic transmissions, they could stall or even fall over if the technology were allowed to bring them to a complete stop. So the Ducati and BMW systems are designed for use only at speeds above about 20 mph.
Using buttons on the left hand grip, riders can choose a desired speed (up to 100 mph) and a following distance. The system software then determines what vehicle, if any, it should follow. (If there’s no vehicle ahead, the motorcycle accelerates to the preset speed, as with normal cruise control.)
One crucial engineering challenge was ensuring that when the cruise systems speed up or apply the brakes, it’s done smoothly and gradually — especially when the motorcycles are leaned over in a turn.
This is a real concern in the marketplace. The popular Common Tread blog was one of the first to confirm that the new Ducati would come with adaptive cruise control. One reader commented, “Hell no. … I also drive a new Mercedes and a few times, it has caught me off guard and slammed on the brakes! If that had happened on one of my motorcycles, don’t know what would have happened.”
Both manufacturers’ systems slow down on their own if lean angles exceed certain thresholds. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, the racing-obsessed Italians designed theirs to work at lean angles up to 50 degrees, at which point most riders would be dragging a knee.)
So what happens if a vehicle the motorcycle is following suddenly slows down and the cruise system can’t maintain a safe following distance? The motorcycles will flash a “take over request” on the dash, and the rider must take over braking or take other action to avoid getting too close.
These first motorcycle adaptive cruise control systems are not to be confused with Automatic Emergency Braking. This tech is already common in automobiles but years in the future for motorcycles.
Davide Previtera, Ducati’s project manager for the development of the Multistrada V4S, emphasizes that adaptive cruise control “is a convenience system, not a safety system; it is there to enhance comfort during highway travels.”
The radar systems only recognize vehicles traveling in the same lane and direction. They will not brake or respond at all if you come across a vehicle that is stopped in your path.
Although no U.S. riders have experienced adaptive cruise control yet, they’ve already expressed plenty of skepticism. Another commenter on the Common Tread blog wrote, “The main reason I ride is the challenge of riding on two wheels and arriving safely due my own skills. … I like relying on my ability to shift, brake, corner and accelerate on my own.”
That’s an opinion familiar to Fings at BMW. He said, “They might say, ‘It’s too much electronics, too many things I don’t need for motorcycle riding.’”
He was a skeptic, too. “I thought, I know how to cruise, I can open and close the throttle by myself. But once you understand how it works, that keeping a safe distance to the car in front no longer needs to be a main focus, you have more of your attention available for other things happening on the road around you. You can relax and have more fun.”
Ducati and BMW think that’s a concept American motorcyclists will get behind.

A Bumper Crop of Mushrooms in Ukraine

KHOMUTYNSI, Ukraine — Valery Kravchuk, a seasoned mushroom hunter, pushed aside some dead leaves to reveal his prize: a beautiful blusher, so called because it turns pink when pinched.
“Mushrooms are like magnets for me,” he said. “I feel them.”
This fall, Ukrainians have been driving their cars down country roads, getting out and walking deep into the forest for the world’s most socially distanced pastime: mushroom hunting.
By serendipity, the country had a bumper crop of mushrooms in a year when gathering them remains one of the few activities for those wanting to get out of the house while avoiding other people.
Ukrainian biologists chalked up the bounty this fall to a dry summer followed by an unusually warm fall and late first frost, coming only at the end of November.
“All the mushrooms which were supposed to grow starting in July had to fit into a month and a half this autumn,” said Zinaida Kosynska, a mycologist and author of Ukrainian mushroom guidebooks.
“It’s been amazing,” said Emilia Koleda, a professional mushroom hunter who sells her finds on the shoulder of a highway outside Kyiv, the capital.
She stood beside seven buckets of boletus mushrooms, a late season delicacy that she said she scooped up during just a single forest excursion. In past years, three buckets made for a good day.
The mushroom bonanza has been a lucky break in a poor country, where mushrooms are a staple for some families, while others supplement their income by picking for the market.
Koleda said there were no other possibilities to earn money because of lockdowns. With her income, she bought firewood for winter heating and everything her grandchildren needed for school.
“Mushrooms saved so many people this year,” she said. “Nature helped us through the quarantine.”
In Ukraine, a line of cars parked on the roadside in the middle of nowhere is a telltale sign that hunters are about, walking quietly among the trees, carrying small mushroom harvesting knives.
“It is my way to be in nature,” said Andriy Hrybovskyi, whose last name actually translates as mushroom, a sign of the activity’s deep roots in Ukraine.
He knows a few spots in a forest he can visit after work, to breathe fresh air and find dinner.
Knowledge of the sites in the forest where mushrooms grow is the currency of mushroom hunters, both professional and amateur, and that knowledge is a closely guarded secret.
When asked for advice on locations, the etiquette for a polite Ukrainian mushroom hunter is to describe some phony spots, so as not to appear rude, while in fact never revealing where the mushrooms really are. Ukrainians who have taken to tagging spots on Google maps are seen as spoilers of this tradition.
Many Ukrainian families appoint a designated taster, usually someone deeply versed in the various species who knows which to avoid. The taster will sample the harvest a day before everybody else, just in case. It is a grim tradition but necessary.
Viktoria Ganzha, from Poltava in eastern Ukraine, who tastes for her family, has been busy this year. She described the role as that of a sapper, the first to enter a minefield.
“I am the de-miner,” she said.
The Ukrainian government has reported an increase in poisonings this year, the downside of the mushroom bounty. By mid-November, 289 people had been poisoned and 11 had died, the government said.
The authorities closely monitor another danger in Ukraine, radioactive mushrooms picked in the region surrounding Chernobyl. Harvesting in the area is illegal, but the mushrooms popping up in the Chernobyl zone this fall have fascinated Ukrainians over anecdotal accounts that they are unnaturally large, fitting the stereotype of radiation’s effects on top of an already good mushroom year.
Police arrested one group of men smuggling 120 pounds of mushrooms from the Chernobyl zone.
Professional pickers are also finding an abundance of the common toadstool this year.
Viktor Klimov, a professional picker in the pine forests in northern Ukraine, specializes in the toadstool. The cartoonish, red-and-white polka-dot mushrooms are poisonous but seen to have medicinal qualities in tiny doses, including boosting the immune system. Dried toadstools are in demand.
“I have never seen so many toadstools in my entire life,” Klimov said of this year’s mushroom season.
The pine forests where Klimov works are overgrown with moss, making hunters’ steps silent. Out in this forest, every spoken word feels like a crime. Hunters speak only in a whisper.
Mushrooms like warm and rainy weather, but not too much of either. They need balance — and this is exactly the feeling that those who pick them are looking for, too, particularly in this unstable year.
Kravchuk, who was hunting this month for blushers, drives slowly on the muddy, barely passable road leading to his spot — a grove of 100-year-old oaks between farm fields — believing the mushrooms like a calm atmosphere.
Though he loves to pick them, Kravchuk does not enjoy eating them.
When he returned home, he nibbled a few as a precaution, and then set them aside for his family to pickle or fry with potatoes and onions.

A Theater’s ‘Last Gasp’ Doesn’t Look Like the End

Back in March, Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver, of the theater duo Split Britches, were in Britain developing a new show when COVID-19 exploded. It made more sense to stay put than to scamper back home to New York, which looked pretty scary at the time. Weaver, who has spent part of the year in London for nearly two decades, teaching performance at Queen Mary University, had a shared place there, but Shaw’s accommodations across town were an issue.
Luckily, neighbors of Weaver’s volunteered an empty house they had been planning to gut and renovate.
“There was electricity, heat, running water and one chair,” Weaver, 71, said, describing the London house in a recent video call from the Catskills.
Recounting the experience, she said friends and fellow theatermakers had donated furniture, and someone who was moving to a nursing home gave them kitchen equipment.
“We got her toaster, microwave, plates — which we brought back to New York because we love them so much,” Weaver said.
In that otherwise bare house, the two women — “ Peggy and I are an off-again, on-again couple,” Weaver noted; their complicity during the joint interview was obvious — resumed work on “Last Gasp,” the new show they were meant to perform at New York’s La MaMa in April and London’s Barbican in June.
The dates ended up being canceled, like all dates, but “Last Gasp WFH” (for working from home) was created and recorded on Zoom. Weaver directed and the two women handled the sound and lighting themselves, with the help of a remote team that included technical designers and a choreographer.
The resulting hybrid of theater, movement and video — Shaw, 76, called it a Zoom movie, or “Zoomie” — is not just one of the 40-year-old company’s best pieces but among the most evocative art to emerge from the COVID era; it is streaming on the La MaMa website until Saturday.
The title, which came early in the process, proved premonitory.
“We were looking at the backdrop of climate change, the integration of our aging process, Peggy saying it was going to be her last show, the last gasp of democracy, maybe,” Weaver said. “Then we found ourselves in a pandemic, where you couldn’t breathe, and in a civil unrest that was symbolized by ‘I can’t breathe.’
“And then we found ourselves in a house that was also in its last gasp,” she added. “We had no idea these things would come together in that way when we named the show over a year ago.”
That is a lot to unpack, yet “Last Gasp WFH” is remarkably light on its feet. For starters, the 90-minute piece looks effortlessly striking because Weaver and Shaw position themselves perfectly within the frame, coming up with almost painterly compositions.
“We have a spatial awareness that we obviously bring to our theater and performance,” Weaver said, “but maybe being able to see ourselves in the frame had something to do with it.”
The fleet, surprisingly entertaining movie is alternately playful, surreal, pointed and poignant, and its nonlinear scenes incorporate many of Split Britches’ calling cards: autobiography, sly humor, pop-culture references (Bill Withers to Beyoncé) and questioning of gender.
This makes Weaver’s matter-of-fact mention that the project would be Shaw’s last performance all the more bittersweet. Shaw has long been a singular presence on the American theater scene, a butch lesbian who has regularly explored her identity in such pieces as “Menopausal Gentleman.”
Then again, “Peggy has said this is her last show since we started working together 40 years ago,” Weaver said, laughing. “This is her coping mechanism.”
Yes, but what if she really means it now?
“For whatever reason, if it’s the last one, I feel really happy that it exists in this form and that it’s manifested itself in this way,” Weaver said. “I feel really pleased with the way it is.”
Shaw, who was just off-camera, piped in: “We’ll make another movie.” (She and Weaver were calling from their Catskills house; they also each have a studio in Manhattan’s East Village.)
“Peggy, you can come and sit here,” Weaver reminded her, before reorienting the laptop so Shaw could be onscreen.
“I knew this was going to happen,” she added dryly, clearly aware her charismatic, witty accomplice would not be able to remain quiet for long .
Shaw, who had a stroke in 2011 (a setback she explored in the solo show “Ruff”), can’t memorize lines anymore. In “Last Gasp WFH,” she wears big headphones to listen to the words that Weaver feeds her during monologues.
There is no attempt to hide what’s going on.
“I couldn’t fit little headphones into my ears because I already have hearing aids,” Shaw said. “Johnnie Ray had a big hearing aid in the 1950s in order to perform,” she continued, referring to a partially deaf singer whom she name-checks in the piece .
“The other thing is, that was the only pair of headphones we had. Like, we just wore black (in the movie) because we didn’t have anything with us from the show, except the yellow slicker and the yellow boots, in case it rained or something.”
In scenes they shared, Weaver couldn’t also be reading out Shaw’s lines. So they scrawled them on paper and taped the pages to a wall.
“We were trying to act a scene we adapted from ‘Marriage Story,’” Weaver said, alluding to the Noah Baumbach film about a divorcing couple. “It’s such an iconic fight between two people, and the subject was the same one that we have: We have had affairs and fights about it. We have conflicts over the fact that Peggy gets awards and I don’t, even though we work together.”
In many ways, “Last Gasp WFH” feels like a culmination for Split Britches — even though it’s not in the company’s usual medium.
“We know and trust our methods now,” Weaver explained. “And in this case, we had the opportunity to fine-tune them in ways that we don’t often get to fine-tune them on the stage. I don’t think we know how to do anything else.”

Until the coronavirus pandemic, their meetings took place quietly, every day, discreet gatherings in the basements of churches, a spare room at the YMCA, the back of a cafe. But members of Alcoholics Anonymous and other groups of recovering substance abusers found the doors quickly shut this spring, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
What happened next is one of those creative cascades the virus has indirectly set off. Rehabilitation moved online, almost overnight, with zeal. Not only are thousands of AA meetings taking place on Zoom and other digital hangouts, but other major players in the rehabilitation industry have leapt in, transforming a daily ritual that many credit with saving their lives.
“AA members I speak to are well beyond the initial fascination with the idea that they are looking at a screen of Hollywood Squares,” said Dr. Lynn Hankes, 84, who has been in recovery for 43 years and is a retired physician in Florida with three decades of experience treating addiction. “They thank Zoom for their very survival.”
Although online rehab rose as an emergency stopgap measure, people in the field say it is likely to become a permanent part of the way substance abuse is treated. Being able to find a meeting to log into 24/7 has welcome advantages for people who lack transportation, are ill, juggling parenting or work challenges that make an in-person meeting tough on a given day and may help keep them more seamlessly connected to a support network. Online meetings can also be a good steppingstone for people just starting rehab.
“There are so many positives — people don’t need to travel. It saves time,” said Dr. Andrew Saxon, an addiction expert and professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “The potential for people who wouldn’t have access to treatment easily to get it is a big bonus.”
Todd Holland lives in northern Utah, and he marvels at the availability of virtual meetings of Narcotics Anonymous around the clock. He recently checked out one in Pakistan that he heard had a good speaker but had trouble with some delay in the video and in understanding the speaker’s accent.
Some participants say the online experience can have a surprisingly intimate feel to it.
“You get more a feel for total strangers, like when a cat jumps on their lap or a kid might run around in the background,” said a 58-year-old AA member in early recovery in Portland, Oregon, who declined to give his name, citing the organization’s recommendations not to seek personal publicity.
Plus, he added, there are no physical logistics to attending online.
“You don’t go into a stinky basement and walk past smokers and don’t have to drive," he said.
At the same time, he and others say they crave the raw intensity of physical presence.
“I really miss hugging people,” he said. “The first time I can go back to the church on the corner for a meeting, I will, but I’ll still do meetings online.”
Holland, who for decades abused drugs until Narcotics Anonymous helped him stay sober for eight years, said the online meetings can “lack the feeling of emotion and the way the spirits and principles get expressed.”
It is too early for data on the effectiveness of online rehabilitation compared to in-person sessions. There has been some recent research validating the use of the technology for related areas of treatment, like PTSD and depression that suggests hope for the approach, some experts in the field said.
Even those people who say in-person therapy will remain superior also said the development has proved a huge benefit for many who would have otherwise faced one of the biggest threats to recovery: isolation.
The implications extend well beyond the pandemic. That’s because the entire system of rehabilitation has been grappling for years with practices some see as both dogmatic and insufficiently effective given high rates of relapse.
“It’s both challenging our preconceived concerns about what is necessary for treatment and recovery but also validating the need for connection with a peer group and the need for immediate access,” said Samantha Pauley, national director of virtual services for the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, an addiction treatment and advocacy organization, with clinics around the country.
In 2019, Hazelden Betty Ford first tried online group therapy with patients in San Diego attending intensive outpatient sessions (three to four hours a day, three to four days a week). When the pandemic hit, the organization rolled out the concept in California, Washington, Minnesota, Florida, New York, Illinois and Oregon — where Pauley works — and has since expanded to New Jersey, Missouri, Colorado and Wisconsin.
Pauley said 4,300 people have participated in such intensive therapy — which entails logging into group or individual sessions using a platform called Mend that is like Zoom. Preliminary results, she said, show the treatment is as effective as in-person meetings at reducing cravings and other symptoms. An additional 2,500 people have participated in support groups for family members.
If not for COVID, Pauley said, the “creative exploration” of online meetings would still have happened but much more slowly.
One hurdle to intensive online rehab involves drug testing of patients, who would ordinarily give saliva or urine samples under in-person supervision. A handful of alternatives have emerged, including one in which people spit into a testing cup while being observed on screen by a provider who verifies the person’s identity. The sample then gets dropped at a clinic or mailed in, although the risk of trickery always remains. In other cases, patients can visit a lab for a drug test.
Additionally, some clinical signs of duress can’t be as easily diagnosed over a screen.
“You can’t see the perspiration that might indicate the person suffering mild withdrawal. There are limitations,” said Dr. Christopher Bundy, president of the Federation of State Physician Health Programs, a group representing 48 state physician health programs that serve doctors in recovery.
He said that hundreds of physicians in these programs are attending regular virtual professionally monitored meetings in which they meet with a handful of specialists for peer support and to assess their progress.
“This sort of thing has challenged our assumptions,” he said of the pandemic and the use of the internet for these therapies. “There’s a sense it’s not the same, but it’s close enough.”
Other participants in drug rehab and leaders in the field say that while online has been a good stopgap measure, they also hope that in-person meetings will return soon.
“It’s been a mixed blessing,” said David Teater, who wears two hats: He’s in recovery himself since the 1980s, and he’s executive director of Ottagan Addictions Recovery, a residential and outpatient treatment center serving low-income patients in western Michigan whose therapy typically gets paid through Medicaid.
In that capacity, he said online tools have been a godsend because, simply, they allowed service to continue. Through $25,000 in grants, the center got new computers and other technology that allowed it to do telemedicine, and set up a “Zoom room.” It includes a 55-inch monitor so that people who are Zooming in can see the counselor as well as the people who feel comfortable enough to come in-person and sit at a social distance wearing masks.
“We think it works equally well; we really do,” Teater said.

Texto completo: Reading Jess Walter's new novel, "The Cold Millions," might be the most fun I've ever had with a history lesson.
Set in wild Washington state a century ago, it fairly bursts with energy, adventure, humor, pathos and irresistible characters. Packed into its bravura storytelling is a close-up look at some of the most dangerous days of the labor movement in the United States and at some of the real people who drove it.
"The Cold Millions" is the seventh novel from Walter. His 2006 novel, "The Zero," was a finalist for the National Book Award; his 2012 book, "Beautiful Ruins," a New York Times No. 1 bestseller. He's also a journalist whose work has appeared in The Washington Post and The New York Times.
Like several of his other books, "The Cold Millions" is historical fiction, mixing real people and events with imagined ones.
It's also a tribute to Walter's hometown, Spokane, set there in 1909 amid the city's exuberant and sometimes violent growth around the start of the 20th century. "It was a boomtown that just kept booming," Walter writes, "doubling in size every six years, going from a few hundred to a hundred-some thousand in just thirty years. ... Spokane felt like the intersection of Frontier and Civilized, the final gasp of a thing before it turned into something else -- the Last Rush Town, Gig called it."
Gig would be Gregory Dolan, one of the countless men and women who crisscrossed the country in search of work. Called floaters and hoboes and many less pleasant names, many of them are immigrants or, like Gig, children of immigrants, at a time when anti-immigrant bigotry is in ugly bloom.
This army of workers is always on the hunt for jobs on farms in harvest season, in mines and bars and brothels in rush towns where gold or silver is discovered, on work gangs building roads and rail tracks, in lumber camps and anyplace else where the labor is hard, the paychecks small and the situation temporary.
At 23, Gig enjoys this life. He decamped from the bitter family home in Montana as a teenager and loves his freedom. He has lately, though, acquired a responsibility: his only surviving family member, baby brother Ryan.
"Rye the last, all of eight years old when his dad dropped dead on the steps of a tavern, the very definition of Irish hell: dying walking into a bar."
Rye is 16 now. He adores his handsome, charming brother and is thrilled to be on the road with him. He's also intrigued by his brother's growing involvement in the labor movement, which in Spokane is focusing on "job sharks," who charge workers like the Dolans a dollar (a day's wage then) to place them in jobs, then get them fired a week or two later so they can bring in new hires and score another buck.
The city's police force meets the workers' speeches and marches with swift brutality. Walter writes a heart-stopping set piece about one of the police riots that ends with both Dolan brothers jailed in appalling conditions. Rye is freed much sooner than Gig, partly because of his age and partly because of an enigmatic entanglement with Lem Brand, one of Spokane's flamboyant millionaires.
"Brand's wealth," Walter writes, "came from silver-mining the Coeur d'Alenes and the rather broad range of vices his workers spent their money on -- cathouses, saloons, hotels, opium dens, and theaters in Spokane's tenderloin, positions he held behind a series of paper partners. 'Lem likes to say that every dollar that goes out in payroll,' Ursula said, 'comes back through bed, brothel and booze.' "
Ursula, aka Ursula the Great, is the connection between Brand and the Dolans. She performs a popular and astounding strip-tease act inside a cage with a live cougar, and both Gig and Brand are smitten with her.
Ursula is not what she seems to be, and neither are several of the other characters Rye falls in with in his quest to get Gig out of jail. Some of those are fictional, but a number of them are real people Walter weaves into his story.
Rye's complicated journey from boy to man is the main line through "The Cold Millions," but this big-hearted book is populated by an array of memorable characters who bring a slice of American history to vibrant life.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin, a former intelligence officer who worked for Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, was mentioned in a media report as being among those under consideration to become President-elect Joe Biden's CIA director.
Slotkin, a Democrat from Holly, won election to her second two-year term representing Michigan's 8th Congressional District on Nov.3. The district is comprised of Ingham and Livingston counties and northern Oakland County.
On Friday, the New York Times mentioned Slotkin among those under consideration to take over the Central Intelligence Agency. Others mentioned included Michael Morell, who served as acting CIA director under Obama; former national security adviser Thomas Donilon, and Sue Gordon, who had served as deputy director of national intelligence.
Slotkin did three tours in Iraq as a CIA officer and went on to work in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. She was the only Iraq adviser held over from the Bush administration when Obama took office in 2009 and later became acting assistant secretary at the Pentagon.
Asked about the speculation on Saturday, Slotkin's spokeswoman, Hannah Lindow, told the Free Press, "While Congresswoman Slotkin appreciates being named alongside such qualified candidates to lead the CIA, she is honored to serve the people of Michigan's 8th District, and looks forward to doing so for a second term in Congress."
Slotkin is not the only Michigander being talked about as having a potential role in the Biden administration. Democratic U.S. Rep. Andy Levin of -Bloomfield Township has the support of some union leaders, including those in the UAW, to take over as secretary of the Department of Labor. The New York Times article also mentioned Gene Sperling, who worked as national economic adviser to Obama and former President Bill Clinton and is from Ann Arbor, as taking on a similar role for Biden.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Holly, is reportedly being considered for the lead role at the CIA in the Biden administration.

"Brand's wealth," Walter writes, "came from silver-mining the Coeur d'Alenes and the rather broad range of vices his workers spent their money on - cathouses, saloons, hotels, opium dens, and theaters in Spokane's tenderloin, positions he held behind a series of paper partners. 'Lem likes to say that every dollar that goes out in payroll,' Ursula said, 'comes back through bed, brothel and booze.' "
Ursula, aka Ursula the Great, is the connection between Brand and the Dolans. She performs a popular and astounding strip-tease act inside a cage with a live cougar, and both Gig and Brand are smitten with her.
Ursula is not what she seems to be, and neither are several of the other characters Rye falls in with in his quest to get Gig out of jail. Some of those are fictional, but a number of them are real people Walter weaves into his story.
Rye's complicated journey from boy to man is the main line through "The Cold Millions," but this big-hearted book is populated by an array of memorable characters who bring a slice of American history to vibrant life.

Texto completo: Too many people are still longing for their old routines. Get some new ones instead.
I attended a Thanksgiving dinner several years ago where the hostess, without warning family and friends, broke with tradition and served salmon instead of turkey, roasted potatoes instead of mashed, raspberry coulis instead of cranberry sauce and ... you get the idea.
While a few guests mustered the politesse to say the meal was "something else," most reacted with undisguised dismay. Some seethed. Others sulked. One young guest actually cried. No one had seconds.
It wasn't that the meal itself was bad. In fact, the meal was outstanding. The problem was that it wasn't the meal everyone was expecting.
When there are discrepancies between expectations and reality, all kinds of distress signals go off in the brain. It doesn't matter if it's a holiday ritual or more mundane habit like how you tie your shoes; if you can't do it the way you normally do it, you're biologically engineered to get upset.
This in part explains people's grief and longing for the routines that were the background melodies of their lives before the pandemic -- and also their sense of unease as we enter a holiday season unlike any other. The good news is that much of what we miss about our routines and customs, and what makes them beneficial to us as a species, has more to do with their comforting regularity than the actual behaviors. The key to coping during this, or any, time of upheaval is to quickly establish new routines so that, even if the world is uncertain, there are still things you can count on.
First, a little background on why we are such creatures of habit. Psychologists, anthropologists, neuroscientists and neurobiologists have written countless books and research papers on the topic but it all boils down to this: Human beings are prediction machines.
"Our brains are statistical organs that are built simply to predict what will happen next," said Karl Friston, a professor of neuroscience at University College London. In other words, we have evolved to minimize surprise.
This makes sense because, in prehistoric times, faulty predictions could lead to some very unpleasant surprises -- like a tiger eating you or sinking in quicksand. So-called prediction errors (like finding salmon instead of turkey on your plate on Thanksgiving) send us into a tizzy because our brains interpret them as a potential threat. Routines, rituals and habits arise from the primitive part of our brains telling us, "Keep doing what you've been doing, because you did it before, and you didn't die."
So the unvarying way you shower and shave in the morning, how you always queue up for a latte before work and put your latte to the left of your laptop before checking your email are all essentially subconscious efforts to make your world more predictable, orderly and safe.
Same goes for Tuesday yoga class, Friday date night, Sunday church services, monthly book clubs and annual holidays. We may associate these activities with achieving a goal -- health, friendship, education, spiritual growth -- but the unwavering regularity and ritualized way with which we go about them, even down to our tendency to stake out the same spot in yoga class or sit in the same pew at church, speak to our need to minimize surprise and exert control.
Routines and rituals also conserve precious brainpower. It turns out our brains are incredibly greedy when it comes to energy consumption, sucking up 20 percent of calories while accounting for only 2 percent of overall body weight. When our routines are disrupted, we have to make new predictions about the world -- gather information, consider options and make choices. And that has a significant metabolic cost.
Dr. Friston said that our brains, when uncertain, can become like overheated computers: "The amount of updating you have to do in the face of new evidence scores the complexity of your processing, and that can be measured in joules or blood flow or temperature of your brain." That exertion, combined with the primordial sense of threat, produces negative emotions like fear, anxiety, hopelessness, apprehension, anger, irritability and stress. Hello, Covid-19.
Our brains are literally overburdened with all the uncertainty caused by the pandemic. Not only is there the seeming capriciousness of the virus, but we no longer have the routines that served as the familiar scaffolding of our lives. Things we had already figured out and relegated to the brain's autopilot function -- going to work, visiting the gym, taking the kids to school, meeting friends for dinner, grocery shopping -- now require serious thought and risk analysis.
As a result, we have less bandwidth available for higher order thinking: recognizing subtleties, resolving contradictions, developing creative ideas and even finding joy and meaning in life.
"It's counterintuitive because we think of meaning in life as coming from these grandiose experiences," said Samantha Heintzelman, an assistant professor of psychology at Rutgers University in Newark who studies the connection between routine behavior and happiness. "But it's mundane routines that give us structure to help us pare things down and better navigate the world, which helps us make sense of things and feel that life has meaning."
Of course, you can always take routines and rituals too far, such as the extremely controlled and repetitive behaviors indicative of addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder and various eating disorders. In the coronavirus era, people may resort to obsessive cleaning, hoarding toilet paper, stockpiling food or neurotically wearing masks when driving alone in their cars. On the other end of the spectrum are those who stubbornly adhere to their old routines because stopping feels more threatening than the virus.
And then there all those hunkered down in a kind of stasis, waiting until they can go back to living their lives as they did before. But that, too, is maladaptive.
"You're much better off establishing a new routine within the limited environment that we find ourselves in," said Dr. Regina Pally, a psychiatrist in Los Angeles who focuses on how subconscious prediction errors drive dysfunctional behavior. "People get so stuck in how they want it to be that they fail to adapt and be fluid to what is. It's not just Covid, it's around everything in life."
Luckily, there is a vast repertoire of habits you can adopt and routines you can establish to structure your days no matter what crises are unfolding around you. Winston Churchill took baths twice a day during World War II, often dictating to his aides from the tub. While in the White House, Barack Obama spent four to five hours alone every night writing speeches, going through briefing papers, watching ESPN, reading novels and eating seven lightly salted almonds.
The point is to find what works for you. It just needs to be regular and help you achieve your goals, whether intellectually, emotionally, socially or professionally. The best habits not only provide structure and order but also give you a sense of pleasure, accomplishment or confidence upon completion. It could be as simple as making your bed as soon as you get up in the morning or committing to working the same hours in the same spot.
Pandemic-proof routines might include weekly phone or video calls with friends, Taco Tuesdays with the family, hiking with your spouse on weekends, regularly filling a bird feeder, set times for prayer or meditation, front yard happy hours with the neighbors or listening to an audiobook every night before bed.
The truth is that you cannot control what happens in life. But you can create a routine that gives your life a predictable rhythm and secure mooring. This frees your brain to develop perspective so you're better able to take life's surprises in stride. You might even be OK with salmon instead of turkey for Thanksgiving -- as long as there's still pie for dessert.

Texto completo: In the silence and darkness of Deb Koker's Bedford, Mass., bedroom, the alarm rings and her eyes pop open. At 3 a.m., this would be an annoyance to most people, but Ms. Koker reaches for her cellphone and eagerly taps an icon on the screen.
This is an hour when most people on the East Coast are still asleep, but Ms. Koker, an engineer and a lawyer, does not have insomnia. The daily Spelling Bee game has just been published online and, while the rest of her family is slumbering peacefully, she can solve the beehive-shaped puzzle without interruption.
Spelling Bee -- a puzzle in which players try to make words from a set of seven unique letters while using the center letter at least once -- is the first of five digital games created by The New York Times Games team. The print version debuted in The New York Times Magazine in 2014, and the online game launched on May 9, 2018. And, while The Times does not share player information, the digital game has been a roaring success, both in terms of the number of subscribers who play the game and the passion that devotees show for it.
In less than an hour, on average, Ms. Koker has conquered the game and, sometime before 4 a.m., she logs on to Twitter to post her score. As is the case on most days, she has reached Queen Bee, an Easter egg level that is not part of the regular scoring of the game, which starts at Beginner and ends officially at Genius. Reaching Queen Bee meant that she had surpassed the Genius level and found all of the words on that day's list.
Beeatrice, the game's cartoon mascot, appears on Ms. Koker's phone wearing a queenly crown.
Ms. Koker is clearly not a typical player. "Within a given week, about 25 percent of players will achieve Genius at least once," said Luke Summerlin, a manager of data and analytics at The New York Times. "But this does not take into account whether or not they reached Genius every day, just once or somewhere in between."
Those who do reach Genius -- the number varies widely depending upon the difficulty of a given puzzle, but Mr. Summerlin estimated it at between 12 and 45 percent of all players -- are greeted by Beeatrice donning a scholar's mortarboard. They have cleared the Beginner, Good Start, Moving Up, Good, Solid, Nice, Great and Amazing levels to do so.
"I wake up early so I have time to get in my workout before I have to deal with reality," Ms. Koker said. "Since I started trying to take Spelling Bee seriously, I starting waking up around 3 a.m. so I can do that first!"
Posting her score on Twitter is not a humblebrag on Ms. Koker's part. It is a sort of call for word nerds to the "Hivemind," as the community is known among followers of the Bee. They will chat with Ms. Koker on Twitter (using the hashtags #hivemind, #spellingbee and #nytsb) and help each other achieve the best score they can, even if they do not reach Queen Bee glory. As soon as they wake up, of course.
"The Spelling Bee followers on social media feel like my extended family," Ms. Koker said. "These days, that's more valuable than ever. It's a lot of what gets me up at 3 a.m. every day. I've also learned a lot from them."
Similar groups gather on social media platforms such as Facebook and Reddit to discuss the Spelling Bee. Readers of The Times's Wordplay column, where self-described "puzzleheads" gather to chat about and get help with the daily crossword, have taken it upon themselves to devote a section in the column's comments to a discussion about the Bee.
And they all formed words happily ever after, right?
Well, mostly. The game is not only highly addictive and satisfying to the many people who play it, but it can also be humorously infuriating to the devoted.
By most accounts, the puzzle community is a generous and friendly one, until a word that is believed by some to be "commonly known" is left off the list of accepted words for a given Spelling Bee puzzle.
Spelling Bee was created as an alternative game for those who might not be interested in the New York Times Crossword. As such, it is edited by the associate puzzles editor Sam Ezersky with an eye for words that can be considered familiar to a majority of solvers, as opposed to some of the tougher vocabulary that solvers see in crossword puzzles.
"It has to be frustrating to discover something you know is a word -- one you might even use regularly -- only to see it nullified by the game," Mr. Ezersky said. "It's all a balance, though. There's only one master list for everyone. And one person's expansive vocabulary or specialized knowledge is another's obscurity or esoterica. So the playing field must be kept level somehow, and my guiding question these days is, 'What feels fair for our audience?"'
When the hivemind feels that a word should be considered commonly known but is not accepted by the online game, the social media universe lights up in mock outrage at Mr. Ezersky, who works on the game on his own.
Not everyone is aware of that. The Twitterverse also likes to tweet at the Wordplay account and, in the early days of the digital game, one particularly incensed solver drove home the point that the word RAFFIA should be accepted, by mailing a package of the palm fiber ribbon to the home of crossword editor Will Shortz, to Mr. Shortz's complete bewilderment.
While The New York Times does not endorse such methods, RAFFIA is now an accepted word and subsequently, players were given a much easier way to vote for the inclusion of certain words. Those who are inclined to do so may write to buzzwords@nytimes.com.
But we're getting ahead of ourselves. First, there was the print version of the game.
The Bee Lands in The New York Times Magazine
Spelling Bee began its flight to word game stardom as one of three puzzles that Mr. Shortz and The Times Magazine's editor, Jake Silverstein, agreed to add to the Sunday puzzle page. Mr. Shortz had seen a similar puzzle called Polygon in The Times of London, and he decided that a variant on it would help him broaden the scope of the games that the magazine offered its readers.
"I felt that The Times already had the 'tough word puzzles' audience covered with its crossword, Acrostic and cryptic," Mr. Shortz said. "The readers we weren't reaching yet were ones who'd like something easier and more accessible."
He added, "So I planned three new things -- Spelling Bee, a small word puzzle by Patrick Berry and a small grid-logic puzzle, usually by Wei-Hwa Huang -- to fit on top of the harder variety word puzzles we were already running."
Mr. Shortz modified the Times of London game by changing the shape to a seven-letter beehive and renaming it Spelling Bee. He also allowed players to reuse letters, which was forbidden in the British game.
The veteran puzzlemaker Frank Longo, who has worked as chief fact checker for the New York Times Crossword for the past 14 years, creates the magazine's Spelling Bee from a computer program that generates lists of words containing seven unique letters, using the latest official tournament Scrabble word list as the source.
"When I submit the puzzle to Will, I always include two lists: One of words I would consider 'common,' and one of 'questionably common' words," Mr. Longo said. "Then Will and his team go over each word on the 'questionably common' list (TACTILITY? BLINI? BLOTTO? REVIVER?) and decide if they believe it merits inclusion on the official published list."
"And yes, sometimes naughty words show up," he continued. "If they're really bad ones, I will just not use the word. But very often, there are infelicitous words that are unavoidable because their letters are so common. For example, ENEMA and DILDO happen to come up a lot. In cases like that, we usually just shrug and leave them off the official answer list."
The Birth of Beeatrice
By 2017, the New York Times Games team -- then known as New York Times Crosswords -- was looking for inspiration for a new project. The team had been given a mandate in late 2016 to create digital games that expanded beyond the Crossword, but there had been a lot of discussion and brainstorming about which type of game to tackle first.
Sam Von Ehren, the lead game maker on the team -- yes, that's his official title -- knew that the group of developers and designers could come up with an original game, but that they also had legacy puzzle games they could digitize if needed. A multitude of solver requests for an online version of the Spelling Bee game -- by then, it had become very popular in the magazine -- made the decision easier. The relative simplicity of the game made it easy to code, and that sealed the decision.
"We prototyped and tested a few other games but Spelling Bee was in a league of its own," Mr. Von Ehren said. "When it came time to start making full production versions of games, we knew we had to start with the Bee."
In August, the team began production on the game. Nine months later, on May 9, 2018, Spelling Bee made its entrance into the world with its first set of letters: W A H O R T Y, with the W in the center of the hive. The pangram -- a word that uses all of the letters in the puzzle at least once -- was THROWAWAY.
Beeatrice was there to welcome players to the game. Robert Vinluan, a senior product designer who has worked on the Games team for four years, is responsible for her friendly face.
"I designed Beeatrice originally because I needed to fill some space," he said. "When you start the game, players see an 'Are you ready to start?' screen like they do on the crossword, but it felt like it needed a visual. So I made a little bee that could be there to greet players and welcome them into the game.
"I also put her on the 'Congrats!' screen to make that moment feel more fun and congratulatory. Visually, I tried to incorporate a few letter B shapes in her design, not unlike how the FedEx logo has a 'hidden' arrow in it. Recently, some designers on our brand team helped redraw Beeatrice to keep her visually in-line with our other icons for our newer games."
These games include the Mini crossword, Letter-Boxed, Tiles and Vertex.
Slouching Toward Genius
So is everyone as smart as Ms. Koker? Does everyone reach Genius and beyond?
It turns out that for some players, reaching Genius is not really the point.
That Zen attitude works well for Taffy Brodesser-Akner, the author of the novel "Fleishman Is in Trouble" and a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. She appreciates the fact that the game keeps her from feeling too competitive. "I look at the game as a way to relax," Ms. Brodesser-Akner said. "I love reminders that you're allowed to have fun without winning, right? And that is very good for someone like me, who has never been able to hold onto a hobby because I can't stop myself from taking things to the next step. I love that there is no next step to this."
"It makes me feel great!" said Reagan Fromm of Brooklyn, N.Y., who says she reaches the Amazing level most of the time. "It's a tiny win to put in my pocket before I start the day."
Peiling Tan of Singapore says that she reaches Great on most days, and she uses the game to learn new words. "I discover new words everyday thanks to the Spelling Bee," Ms. Tan said. "It's a lovely mental workout that I've started doing every day since the lockdown. In addition, my 5-year-old daughter enjoys playing alongside me and it helps her to learn new words too. We get to learn together. How lovely!"
Some players use puzzle solving as a way to take their minds off life's stressors and to stay busy during the coronavirus pandemic. The novelist Laura Lippman, author of "My Life as a Villainess," has since woven other pursuits into her self-care plan, but she enjoys Spelling Bee for its attempt to bring order to a mess of letters.
"I know it's sacrilegious," she said, "but I don't particularly like Scrabble, because it's not really about making words but making points. I like Spelling Bee because it's just about making words. It's about seeing things differently, creating new patterns with letters, finding meaning in seeming chaos."
For others, like Brooks Swett of New York City, it's about maintaining a sense of community when isolated. "Several months ago, my best friend put together a group text thread of people she had gotten hooked on the Bee during the coronavirus quarantine," Ms. Swett said. "It has grown to a group of five players."
"We reflect on words we missed from the day before," she added. "We tell each other how we are getting on with the puzzle, offer encouragement, share words that we try in jest (why not YABADABADOO?) and air our grievances about glaring omissions of words that should be accepted, Sam."
"Our group has big plans, once the pandemic subsides," she said jokingly, "to eat lots of NAAN together, play the LOTTO and hang out with a TORO in a ROCOCO room."
She continued: "We also cheer each other on without giving things away. The closest we ever get to giving each other clues is very occasionally to confirm whether a pangram is a compound word if a person is stumped or to reveal that there are multiple pangrams (we love those days). Often by 7:30 a.m., I already have four texts about the Bee. The thread has branched off into plenty of other topics as well."
Ah yes, that pangram. There is at least one pangram in each game. Sometimes there are more. Entering the pangram in a game scores players a bonus of seven points, in addition to the points received for the length of the word.
Players get very excited when they find it.
Some of them write songs about finding it.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Discovering the pangram can be hit or miss. Some days, it pops right out at you. On other days, players find themselves endlessly typing in random letters or hitting the letter-shuffling button to gain a different perspective on the set.
The best way to discover the pangram, in this player's opinion, is to join a community that shares hints. At some point, players will get stuck, and they are faced with a couple of options. They can put their devices down and walk away for a while -- this almost always works, because it's easier to see new words with fresh eyes -- or they can join a solving community that will be happy to help pry the logjam loose.
Players have been known to create Slack channels at work around the Spelling Bee. Social media platforms are rife with such groups. And there is the particularly devoted one on Wordplay.
Doug Mennella, who lives in Tokyo, Japan, posts a grid every day in the column's comments section based on a computer program he wrote. Others did it before him, and he has since picked up the mantle. No doubt that there will be others to carry on after he can no longer do it, because community requires continuity.
Readers are grateful for his work, and there is a lively discussion around each post, where players share hints to help one another break any mental logjams that might occur. And they celebrate players who post when they have solved the game for the first time on their own.
Of course, some players would like some help without letting others know that they need it. These people can rely on the increasing number of online solving programs that are popping up.
"I've always been a sucker for puzzles that challenge you to make new words from a small set of letters," said William Shunn, a science fiction novelist from Manhattan. "Spelling Bee turbocharges that challenge by daring us to imagine we can hunt down and tame every last valid combination of seven unique letters."
He continued: "Initially, I built the Solver just for myself. The original version was meant only to help me find the pangram once I became hopelessly stuck. The Spelling Bee discussion on Wordplay was crucial to the development of the program. I modeled my letter frequency grids after posts I had seen there, and I also adopted some of the jargon I picked up there."
Christopher McLeester, of Clarksville, Md., built his program to share with others. "As a player of the Bee, I wanted to get more feedback about the words I missed and see some analysis," he said. "And I wanted to do it while things were top of mind, not the next day. I assumed that others felt the same way."
"I started thinking about what the page should look like," he said. "I realized it could be a great way to teach my daughter, Evelyn, about coding, reading charts and how you can have fun doing cool stuff with a computer. And she already liked the Bee. When the online game started in 2018, Evelyn was learning about words and spelling. We started playing it as a family and it caught on as a daily tradition in the house."
'Where's My Word, Sam?'
To recap, the Spelling Bee game -- by most accounts -- is fun to play, a way to challenge your brain while still relaxing, a diversion from stress, a way to learn new words and an opportunity to engage with a lively community of like-minded word lovers. A significant number of players have asked for an archive of the puzzles, so they can go back and play games that they missed or complete games that they were stuck on. That's one sign of a game that has gotten under people's skin.
It is also a chance, to some, to troll the game's editor, Mr. Ezersky.
They do it well. There is a Twitter account called "Not a Spelling Bee Word" that posts words that have been left off the list (most of them are fairly esoteric) and humorously offers ones that might qualify for recognition in the game, if only they were real.
Then there are players with specialized knowledge in areas like physics, sailing or botany, who are bereft when a word they know -- but a majority of other players are not likely to know -- is not accepted. The word LUFF -- the forward edge of a fore-and-aft sail, according to Merriam-Webster.com -- comes up a lot among seafaring types. Physicists will gather on Twitter to loudly wonder in Mr. Ezersky's direction as to why he does not consider PION to be a common word.
Sometimes it gets competitive. Never overlook the gardeners in favor of the techies, Mr. Ezersky. Gardeners work with sharp implements.
"I am often puzzled and frustrated," said Colleen Bates Lance of Birmingham, Ala., in her response to a questionnaire posted on Wordplay -- "that some simpler words, often having to do with flowers or plants -- like vinca or Lantana -- likely known to the large number of people who garden, are deemed unsuitable while technical terms that would seem to be familiar to a minuscule number of people are included."
The Editor Speaks
Mr. Ezersky sold his first crossword puzzle to The New York Times at age 17. He has since had more than 30 crosswords published in the newspaper, and hundreds more smaller puzzles of his have been published in the New York Times Crossword app.
Now 25 years old and a graduate of the University of Virginia, he works as an associate puzzles editor with Mr. Shortz on a variety of projects. This includes being the first pair of eyes to look at crossword submissions when they come in, as well as helping Mr. Shortz to edit puzzles that are accepted.
When Spelling Bee was being developed in 2017, Mr. Ezersky was chosen to become the curator of the word lists. He edits each one individually, and the first step is to make sure that the pangram or pangrams are not head scratchers. They should be words that are instantly familiar.
The next step is ruling out the obvious no-nos. This is where the human touch is needed, and he says that it is one of the most misunderstood parts of his job.
"There is a basic framework to the game, and that dictates how I edit," Mr. Ezersky said. "I start with the following:
No proper nouns or capitalized terms, unless they have a reason for the lowercase context.
No vulgarity or vulgar slang.
No clear variants or British variants on American English words.
Nothing with hyphens or contractions, or anything that's more regularly written as more than one word.
Nothing so informal that players might say, 'That's not really a word ... '
"We really do want solvers to find as many words in the complete list as possible," he said. "If there's a lot of esoterica in the list, what's the point? Had the computer list for the puzzle (O) A D G N R U remained unedited, a part of the solution would have included words like OGDOAD, ONGAONGA, ORAD, ORGANON and OURANG."
He continued: "Would you have been able to find them all? Computers alone can only do so much number-crunching to gauge a word's familiarity."
Mr. Ezersky is not without reference material. "I have a variety of online, up-to-date dictionaries at my disposal, including Merriam-Webster, New Oxford American and the Scrabble databases," he said. "Another favorite resource of mine is Google's News tab, which allows me to check if a word in question has made regular appearances in recent articles, especially in major outlets like The Times."
"If there is anything I don't recognize, I look it up to confirm that it isn't just my own blind spot," he continued. "But there are also what I call the 'Scrabble words' like PENK, TEIL and NIRL that I just know most players will not be familiar with and won't try in the game. Anything that feels like a no-go -- RAFFIA notwithstanding -- is removed from the list."
"Keeping all this in mind, I try to make a final call that feels as fair as possible," he added. "I used to think that the phrase 'commonly known' was a good gauge, but I simply can't dictate to all solvers what is and isn't common. But isn't that part of the fun of Spelling Bee, too? Who doesn't love a game that gives them the chance to feel smart -- smarter than its editor, even -- as well as talk all about it with others?
"And when we learn more about each other, the world's a better place," he said.
Even so, players are hungry for more. Ms. Lippman ended her interview by saying: "I just want dirty words. Is that so much to ask?"
A final note to Mr. Ezersky and the Games team: Consider a "Spelling Bee After Dark" edition.

Texto completo: In a recent Monmouth University survey, 77% of Donald Trump’s backers said Joe Biden had won the presidential election because of fraud. Many of these same people think climate change is not real. Many of these same people believe they don’t need to listen to scientific experts on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
We live in a country in epistemological crisis, in which much of the Republican Party has become detached from reality. Moreover, this is not just an American problem. All around the world, rising right-wing populist parties are floating on oceans of misinformation and falsehood. What is going on?
Many people point to the internet — the way it funnels people into information silos, the way it abets the spread of misinformation. I mostly reject this view. Why would the internet have corrupted Republicans so much more than Democrats, the global right more than the global left?
My analysis begins with a remarkable essay that Jonathan Rauch wrote for National Affairs in 2018 called “The Constitution of Knowledge.” Rauch pointed out that every society has an epistemic regime, a marketplace of ideas where people collectively hammer out what’s real. In democratic, nontheocratic societies, this regime is a decentralized ecosystem of academics, clergy members, teachers, journalists and others who disagree about a lot but agree on a shared system of rules for weighing evidence and building knowledge.
This ecosystem, Rauch wrote, operates as a funnel. It allows a wide volume of ideas to get floated, but only a narrow group of ideas survives collective scrutiny.
“We let alt-truth talk,” Rauch said, “but we don’t let it write textbooks, receive tenure, bypass peer review, set the research agenda, dominate the front pages, give expert testimony or dictate the flow of public dollars.”
Over the past decades the information age has created a lot more people who make their living working with ideas, who are professional members of this epistemic process. The information economy has increasingly rewarded them with money and status. It has increasingly concentrated them in ever more prosperous metro areas.
While these cities have been prospering, places where fewer people have college degrees have been spiraling down: flatter incomes, decimated families, dissolved communities. In 1972, people without college degrees were nearly as happy as those with college degrees. Now those without a degree are far more unhappy about their lives.
People need a secure order to feel safe. Deprived of that, people legitimately feel cynicism and distrust, alienation and anomie. This precarity has created, in nation after nation, intense populist backlashes against the highly educated folks who have migrated to the cities and accrued significant economic, cultural and political power. Will Wilkinson of the Niskanen Center calls this the “Density Divide.” It is a bitter cultural and political cold war.
In the fervor of this enmity, millions of people have come to detest those who populate the epistemic regime, who are so distant, who appear to have it so easy, who have such different values, who can be so condescending. Millions not only distrust everything the “fake news” people say but also the so-called rules they use to say them.
People in this precarious state are going to demand stories that will both explain their distrust back to them and also enclose them within a safe community of believers. The evangelists of distrust, from Trump to Alex Jones to the followers of QAnon, rose up to give them those stories and provide that community. Paradoxically, conspiracy theories have become the most effective community bonding mechanisms of the 21st century.
For those awash in anxiety and alienation, who feel that everything is spinning out of control, conspiracy theories are extremely effective emotional tools. For those in low status groups, they provide a sense of superiority: I possess important information most people do not have. For those who feel powerless, they provide agency: I have the power to reject “experts” and expose hidden cabals. As Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School points out, they provide liberation: If I imagine my foes are completely malevolent, then I can use any tactic I want.
Under Trump, the Republican identity is defined not by a set of policy beliefs but by a paranoid mindset. He and his media allies simply ignore the rules of the epistemic regime and have set up a rival trolling regime. The internet is an ideal medium for untested information to get around traditional gatekeepers, but it is an accelerant of the paranoia, not its source. Distrust and precarity, caused by economic, cultural and spiritual threat, are the source.
What to do? You can’t argue people out of paranoia. If you try to point out factual errors, you only entrench false belief. The only solution is to reduce the distrust and anxiety that is the seedbed of this thinking. That can only be done first by contact, reducing the social chasm between the members of the epistemic regime and those who feel so alienated from it. And second, it can be done by policy, by making life more secure for those without a college degree.
Rebuilding trust is, obviously, the work of a generation.

Farhad Manjoo: Even in a pandemic, the billionaires are winning

Texto completo: When I called up Chuck Collins on Tuesday afternoon, I found him glued to one of the grimmest new metrics documenting America’s economic and social unraveling.
Collins is a scholar of inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, and since March he has been tracking how the collective wealth of American billionaires has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. In previous recessions, Collins said, billionaires were hit along with the rest of us; it took almost three years for Forbes’ 400 richest people to recover losses incurred in 2008′s Great Recession.
But in the coronavirus recession of 2020, most billionaires have not lost their shirts. Instead, they’ve put on bejeweled overcoats and gloves made of spun gold — that is, they’ve gotten richer than ever before.
On Tuesday, as the stock market soared to a record, Collins was watching the billionaires cross a depressing threshold: $1 trillion.
That is the amount of new wealth American billionaires have amassed since March, at the start of the devastating lockdowns that state and local governments imposed to curb the pandemic.
On March 18, according to a report Collins and his colleagues published last week, America’s 614 billionaires were worth a combined $2.95 trillion. When the markets closed Tuesday, there were 650 billionaires and their combined wealth was now close to $4 trillion. In the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, American billionaires’ wealth grew by a third.
It is difficult to think of a more succinctly obscene illustration of the unfairness of the American economic and political system.
“The economy is now wired ‘heads you win, tails I lose,’ to funnel wealth to the top,” Collins told me.
Billionaires amassed their new billions just as millions of other Americans plunged into dire financial straits. More than 20 million people lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic. As Congress lazily contemplates whether or not to bother to continue to provide economic assistance to America’s neediest, as many as 13 million people are at risk of losing the expanded benefits that keep them just beyond the grip of hunger and homelessness.
Food banks across the country are bracing for another surge in demand. If a federal moratorium on evictions is allowed to expire at the end of the year, millions of Americans will have to pay months of back rent — making them vulnerable to what housing advocates warn will be a wave of evictions.
Why are American billionaires doing so well while so many other Americans suffer? Part of the story is garden-variety American inequality. Stocks are overwhelmingly owned by the wealthy, and the stock market has recovered from its early-pandemic depths much more quickly than other parts of the economy.
But some billionaires are also benefiting from economic and technological trends that were accelerated by the pandemic. Among these are the owners and investors of retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, which have reported huge profits this year while many of their smaller competitors were clobbered as the coronavirus spread.
Then there are companies that have bet on the rapid digitization of everything. Eric Yuan, the chief executive of Zoom, became a billionaire in 2019. Now he is worth almost $20 billion. Apoorva Mehta, the founder of the grocery-delivery company Instacart, was not a billionaire last year; this year, after a spike in orders that led to a new round of investment that pumped up the value of his company, he’s safely in the club. Dan Gilbert, the chairman of Quicken Loans, was worth less than $7 billion in March; now he commands more than $43 billion.
But like in the rest of the economy, there is a great deal of stratification even among billionaires — richer billionaires got even richer in 2020 than the poorer ones did.
Some of the numbers are staggering. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, was worth about $113 billion at the start of the pandemic. Now he is worth $182 billion — an increase of about $69 billion. Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, three of the largest shareholders of Walmart, saw their combined wealth grow by $47 billion during the pandemic.
Two years ago, Bezos was the only “centibillionaire” on Earth — the trendy neologism for people whose wealth exceeds $100 billion. Now there are five — in addition to Bezos, there’s Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Bernard Arnault, the French luxury tycoon. Arnault’s wealth plummeted early in the pandemic, but demand for some luxury goods has rebounded in recent months, and his fortune is once again secure.
The political scene has also been kind to billionaires in 2020. A year ago, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren appeared to have a good shot at capturing the Democratic nomination for president, and pundits like myself were suggesting extreme measures like the abolishment of billionaires.
Billionaires can breathe much easier now. Joe Biden, not Sanders or Warren, is going to be the president. As he told a gathering of donors last year, Biden believes that rich people are “just as patriotic as poor people,” and he suggested that “nothing would fundamentally change” for the wealthy when he’s in charge.
The possibility that the Senate will remain in Republican hands — or, if not, will be closely divided — is also good for billionaires. Some of the most ambitious liberal efforts to combat inequality — like a repeal of Trump’s corporate tax cuts, a new wealth tax or a tax on financial transactions — look unlikely to pass.
The political results point to the continuing danger to our democracy of the rise of superbillionaires — that they will use their wealth to build a political fortress around themselves, allowing them to gain even more wealth and influence.
“I do think we’re at risk of the oligarchic death spiral,” Collins told me. “Wealth concentrates and power concentrates, and the wealthy use their power to rig the rules to get more wealth and power.”
Collins is hopeful that we can avert the death spiral. He suggested that extreme inequality could prompt a political backlash. Perhaps, seeing the pandemic’s toll on nonbillionaire Americans, our leaders will be moved to fight for greater benefits for workers, more affordable and accessible health care and child care, and progressive taxation that can reduce some of the disparities between people at the top and everyone else.
In the absence of such reforms, Collins said, we may be staring down an uglier future. “The knot that we’re in is a tough one to unravel in a peaceful way,” he said.

Bob Neal: Thanks in the time of COVID

Texto completo: The online popup ad for a sweatshirt reads: “Wine (noun). The glue holding this 2020 sh**show together.”
It seems a safe bet that no one wants ever to see another year like this. Maybe not even Jeff Bezos, whose Amazon corporation has piled up tons of profits as people shun stores so they don’t pay with their lives for buying a new slipcover.
Still, a few good things have happened this year, and a couple of days after our annual ritual of gratitude and self-engorgement, it may help to pause, think about that for which we are grateful and to offer thanks.
Amid the general gloom that 60% of us feel over national politics, our democracy has held. So far. Some of that is because newspapers continue to report facts. If only the internet “platforms” were forced, through libel laws, to back up what they publish as are newspapers, radio and over-the-air TV. So, for the Sun Journal, the Bangor Daily News, the New York Times, the Washington Post, PBS NewsHour, NPR, I give thanks.
David Brooks, a conservative columnist for The New York Times, has written that our politics and culture are nobler at the local level than inside the D.C. beltway. We see evidence of that as the president has dragged us through his hissy fit of denying the truth of the election. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state and a Republican, oversaw a laborious hand recount of nearly 5 million votes. And, Aaron Van Langevelde, a Republican member of the Michigan Board of Canvassers, voted to certify the election outcome despite pressure from the president’s team. For state and local officials who do their jobs honestly and make our democracy work day-in-day-out, I give thanks.
You see a few yard signs around here reading “My Governor is an Idiot” or “Impeach Mills.” Gov. Janet Mills is a local, as she notes, the first governor from Franklin County. The COVID-19 row has been tough for her to hoe, but Maine has the country’s second-lowest infection rate and, despite recent spikes in cases and deaths, has moved up to second-lowest death rate. Difficult as these past eight months have been for all of us, Mills is doing a lot right. Note: She is the first Democrat for whom I voted for governor. For Gov. Mills’s actions to keep us safe, I give thanks.
And Dr. Nirav Shah, head of Maine’s Center for Disease Control, has carefully and calmly explained to us in countless hours of briefings just what scientists are learning as the virus assaults the world. For his steady hand and patience with those of us who don’t do science every day, I give thanks.
There may be as many responses by businesses to the COVID restrictions as there are businesses. Some people, myself included, are making shopping decisions at least partly on the basis of the safety measures we see in stores. My fellow old fahts and I shop early in the day at Hannaford in Farmington. Management has set aside an hour primarily for elderly and vulnerable people. On this week’s shopping trip, I saw only one person not wearing a mask, a young woman breezing through the store as if nothing were out of the ordinary. I noticed a couple of other masked people who turned their backs on her as she walked by, as I did. She seemed unfazed. For the overwhelming use of masks by employees and customers and for Hannaford setting aside those hours, I give thanks.
Nobody doesn’t like Dolly Parton. It came out recently that the buxom — can you say understatement? — songwriter and singer has been in the quest for a vaccine against COVID. She donated $1 million to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine for vaccine research. Writing a check for a million bucks shows once again that Dolly Parton is a national treasure, which may come to more than being a hero. Disclosures. I love my Dolly Parton albums, and I am proud to have attended grad school — I didn’t finish — at Vandy. For Dolly Parton and Vanderbilt University researchers, I give thanks.
While we’re in Nashville, Maine Public television has been rerunning Ken Burns’s “Country Music” film, this time one episode a week on Sunday at 3 p.m. The final episode is tomorrow. I watched every minute of it first time around, two-plus hours a night for eight nights in a stretch of 11. Great stuff, and I’m not even a huge Ken Burns fan. The country music episodes are even better spaced out a week at a time. Catch the finale tomorrow, if you can. And rest assured, this being PBS, the series will air yet again. For the work Ken Burns did to tell the story of America’s Music (good and bad) and of all the types of people who have created and sustained it, I give thanks.
Though we didn’t get down to the Stone Mountain Arts Center in Brownfield this year for any concerts — since March, the shows have been canceled because of COVID-19 — we did get down there a couple of times to eat. In a flash of Yankee ingenuity, owner Carol Noonan began offering dinner-only nights and a few socially distanced shows. The food is outstanding, and it lasts for a couple of days, some in your belly and some in the big doggie box you take home. (Because of my age and cardiac history, we don’t risk going to the shows.) For Carol Noonan, her stage and her kitchen, I give thanks.
You’ve probably never heard of Nora McInerny. I hadn’t either until I heard her talk on the radio about grief. It was less than a year after my wife had died, so the subject was at the top, bottom, front and rear of my brain. And heart. McInerny had lost her young husband to brain cancer. She gave me and my girlfriend, whose husband died 26 days after my wife died, a perspective to help guide us through grief. McInerny said she tired of people asking her if she was “ready to move on from” from her late husband, Aaron. You don’t “move on from,” she said. You “move forward with” your lost loved one. That bit of wisdom has meant a great deal to each of us. For Nora McInerny and her insight, I give thanks.
Bob Neal has hunkered down at home in New Sharon since COVID-19 hit. He’s hoping we can soon start counting the days until vaccines are widely available.

Texto completo: El número total de casos de coronavirus en Estados Unidos en noviembre superó los cuatro millones el sábado, más del doble del récord establecido en octubre que sumó 1.9 millones de casos. Y es probable que la fuerte escalada continúe, o que crezca aún más, según el reporte de The New York Times.
“Estamos en camino de continuar con este ritmo acelerado de la epidemia y ver un aumento de casos aún más rápido debido al movimiento en el interior, de las actividades en todo el país y porque un gran número de personas se han mudado por el país durante las vacaciones”, dijo a The New York Times Tom Inglesby , director del Centro de Seguridad Sanitaria de la Universidad Johns Hopkins.
El hito se produjo cuando los estadounidenses viajaron por millones durante el largo fin de semana de Acción de Gracias y en medio de un Viernes Negro que vio algunas tiendas abarrotadas, incluso cuando los comerciantes guiaron a los clientes a las ventas en línea y limitaron las compras en persona.
Trump: Distribución de vacunas contra COVID-19 comenzará “la próxima semana” Gobernadora de Nuevo México firma millonario paquete de ayuda económica por el coronavirus Condados de la Bahía de San Francisco ordenan medidas más drásticas y los 49ers se quedan sin casa
Más de 170,000 personas en los Estados Unidos ahora dan positivo en un día promedio. Más de 1.1 millones de personas dieron positivo en la última semana.El total general del país, desde el inicio de la pandemia, supera los 13 millones de infecciones, con mucho el brote más grande del mundo.
Sin embargo, el feriado del Día de Acción de Gracias causó sesgos en los informes al final de la semana, con una fuerte caída en los nuevos casos reportados el jueves, y luego un gran salto el viernes.
Muchos estados no informaron datos sobre el feriado de Acción de Gracias, cuando el recuento nacional aumentó en más de 103,000 casos y más de 1,100 muertes, niveles mucho más bajos que el jueves 19 de noviembre anterior, cuando se registraron 187,000 casos y 1,962 muertes.
Por esa misma razón, las cifras fueron artificialmente altas el viernes, cuando muchos estados informaron datos de dos días.
Estados Unidos ha informado de más de 100,000 infecciones cada día durante 26 días consecutivos. El promedio diario entre la semana y el viernes fue de más de 166,000, casi 2.5 veces más alto que los recuentos pico del verano en julio.
El número de pacientes con Covid-19 en hospitales de EE.UU. alcanzó niveles récord el sábado por la noche, con 91,635 estadounidenses hospitalizados con Covid19, según el Proyecto de seguimiento de COVID.
Y si bien hay más buenas noticias en el frente de las vacunas , por ahora los estadounidenses deben “refugiarse” y prepararse para un invierno difícil por delante.

Texto completo: RIO RANCHO, N.M. — Stay at home, the most-recent mantra from New Mexico’s governor and health officials, was reiterated Nov. 23 in a Zoom media conference, along with a previously unmentioned way of treating COVID-19 patients: proning.
“Find your humanity for the next few weeks,” urged Presbyterian Chief Patient Safety Officer and Medical Director of Infection Control Dr. Jeff Salvon-Harman, “thinking of yourself as well as those around you.”
“A lot of New Mexico spread is coming from family gatherings,” noted UNM Hospital Chief Quality and Safety Officer Dr. Rohini McKee, with the trio of physicians urging everyone to get flu shots, socially distance themselves and, “if you are feeling ill, seek medical care.”
The use of proning — keeping COVID-19 patients lying on their stomachs or their sides — helps improve the flow of oxygen throughout the body, and has proven to be very helpful in “re-distributing the oxygen and various fluids within the lungs … (and is) a better way to oxygenate,” said Lovelace Chief Medical Officer Dr. Vesta Sandoval, resulting in “improvement to the patient.”
“Puttying people on ventilators early was not helpful,” added McKee. The New York Times pointed to large gatherings as a primary cause for the recent surge: “… politicians and public-health officials have warned against gatherings among family and friends, calling them a major driver of new coronavirus infections. And they are right that you should minimize your risk this week. … (and data) suggests that the biggest drivers of infections are not small gatherings, but rather the usual culprits: long-term care facilities, food processing plants, prisons, restaurants and bars.”
The numbers
New Mexico is among nine states reporting more than twice as many new cases a day as it did two weeks ago, the Times said, with officials warning that it will only get worse if people disregard warnings about travel and gatherings during the holidays.
Salvon-Harman was somewhat optimistic, noting the state’s rolling five-day average had dipped slightly, attributing that fact to the governor’s latest public-health order. Data showed that five-day rolling average decreased from 2,877 on Nov. 22 to 2,750 on Nov. 23 and then 2,083 on Nov. 26.
In Sandoval County, after only one day with more than 90 positive tests daily through the first 16 days of November, the county experienced 117 or more such cases daily Nov. 17-26.
Nov. 20 marked the day with the most fatalities for the county (five), after no more than two from Nov. 1-19, and then three more Nov. 22 and 24. The county had zero COVID-19 fatalities eight times Nov. 2-19. Through Nov. 26, there have been 4,535 cases reported in Sandoval County for the entire pandemic.
There were nearly 300 beds occupied in the state’s intensive-care units last week.
“It is true we are running out of beds,” cautioned McKee. “It is entirely possible in the next few weeks that we run out of ICU beds,” which will be “exceptionally challenging for our state.”
Plus, added Salvon-Harman, “We absolutely are challenged right now with the staffing.”
Presbyterian facilities — there are nine in the state, with three in the metro area, including Rust Medical Center in Rio Rancho — he said, have seen some employee-employee spread. It has encouraged employees to take breaks apart from each other to stop “unintentional exposures.”
TriCore Reference Laboratories, charged with testing, has been “stretched to the limit,” Salvon-Harman added.
The trio were satisfied that the development of telemedicine can help control the number of actual hospital visits, along with infusion centers apart from hospitals.
Hope on the horizon
Although historically vaccines typically require years of research and testing before reaching the clinic, according to the New York Times, scientists are racing to produce a safe and effective coronavirus vaccine by next year. Researchers are testing 54 vaccines in clinical trials on humans, and at least 87 preclinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals.
The Times also noted that six vaccines have been approved for early or limited use, but none has been approved for full use.
“When vaccines become available, we can flatten the curve, bring the infection rate down,” Salvon-Harman said.
The Times reported Tuesday that in the first distribution push, 6.4 million doses of Pfizer’s vaccine will be shipped across the U.S. around mid-December.
There is no cure yet for COVID-19.

For Bangles, I Head to Hyderabad

Strategizing my outfits for my cousin Saad’s 10-event, two-continent wedding last winter was an exercise in project management. I plotted out every ensemble and the corresponding accessories that would travel with me from New York to San Francisco to Hyderabad, India. I made charts to work out which heels and purses could do double duty for multiple functions, but for each gharara or churidar I planned to wear, I needed just the right composition of crystal-studded bangles to match.
A rainbow of magenta, teal and lime for the pre-wedding sanchak-mehndi party. Thick gold cuffs for the nikah, or marriage ceremony. A dainty mix of shimmering black and pink for the walima, or reception. From the hundreds of bangles I still store neatly in clear boxes at my parents’ house in Massachusetts, I devised perfect pairings for each day of the festivities — and a few extras, just in case.
My expansive bangle collection is proof that I’ve spent many afternoons bargaining in the Laad Bazaar in Hyderabad. (“If we take her to Laad Bazaar, she won’t come back,” my grandmother used to say about me.) This city, my parents’ hometown, is known for these glittering lacquer bangles; weddings and religious festivals — neither of which are in short supply in India — are a reliable excuse to amass new sets. Hyderabadi women regularly refresh their collections with the latest designs; brides from across India come to the bazaar to match bracelets to their trousseaus; and tourists come to the lively thoroughfare for the ambience and the sparkly souvenirs.
“Diamonds are diamonds, but these look stunning, too,” said Swapna Mehta, a Hyderabadi jewelry designer. She frequently seeks inspiration from the markets near the Charminar, the 429-year-old monument that’s the cynosure of Hyderabad’s Old City. “When I was getting married, the only go-to place to buy gotas or lac bangles was Charminar.”
Laad Bazaar occupies the artery to the west of the Charminar. The first few steps are always the most disorienting, as you blink to adapt to the blinding displays: thousands of bangles twinkling in shop after shop, light coming off the glass cases like fireworks. Hawkers sell bundles of bangles on street carts in front of showrooms where salespersons beseech you to browse: “Madam, madam, one minute.”
There’s plenty of finery on sale in the bazaar and the nearby markets, including antique jewelry from the era of the Nizams; delicate crystal bottles of attar perfume; embroidered borders, or gota masalas, for traditional Hyderabadi khada dupattas, or bridal outfits. But it’s the bangles that draw most of the traffic to the bazaar, which locals often call Choodi Bazaar: bangle market.
Shopping in the bazaar is as much about enjoying Hyderabadi hospitality and humor as it is about commerce, and as with many things in Hyderabad, there is no rushing the matter. I usually arrive with swatches of colors I want to match and then settle in for the long haul, leaving the negotiations to an unaccented relative. (“We give those higher prices to foreigners, not you,” one shopkeeper assured us. Prices can range from 100 rupees, about $1.35, for a simple pair to more than 20,000 rupees for custom-made bridal designs.) Set after set is presented with a flourish, and if they don’t have the color or size you want, a boy might be sent to a relative’s shop nearby to get it, while the salesperson distracts you with tea and conversation.
“It’s symbiotic,” Deepthi Sasidharan, a heritage consultant and director of Eka Archiving Services, said. “Like any other bazaar, there are family businesses where there are father, sons and cousins who have four or five shops between them.” And the alliances span beyond bangles.
“Afzal Miyan will do a fabric for you that has a specific kind of stone or bead that you need and that can be matched perfectly by a bangle seller three shops down,” she said. “So you get this perfectly synchronous set of clothes and bangles and jewelry that looks as if it’s all been made together, but it isn’t. It’s just craftsmen who have, over hundreds of years, perfected and made their tasks synchronous.”
People I asked have different takes on the history of Laad Bazaar, but a popular origin story, recorded on a placard at the Charminar, dates it to the late 16th century. It says the Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah, founder of Hyderabad, established the market for the wedding of his daughter; the tangle of bangle shops came later. Laad means lacquer: Hence the name of the market, where there are an estimated 200 shops dedicated to the bracelets.
The bangles are handmade by artisans in nearby workshops, and Mohammed Zubair, owner of Khaja Bangles and Jewellers, explained the process to me. Lacquer comes from resin, which is melted over a furnace and molded into a circle, then embellished with crystals, beads or mirrors.
“We’re famous in the whole world,” he told me, listing the destinations he’s traveled to for exhibitions, including the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. His shop is now working on a set in honor of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, whose mother was Indian, which will include an American flag and an Indian one.
The intricacy of the patterns the artisans etch out of crystals is remarkable, and the palettes and designs seem to evolve with every visit.
“I’ve gone to one of the stores and been like, ‘Can you make this pattern for me?,’ and they’ve told me, ‘We can make your face if we want,” said Suhani Pittie, a designer, who in one piece mixed lac with imitation leather to create a modern look in black and white. “They’re vociferously trying to understand their target audience and modulating their designs.”
The wedding industry and a full calendar of festivals keep the Laad Bazaar busy. Zubair has a master’s degree in business, but returned to work with his father at the store his grandfather opened in the 1950s. Another shop owner I spoke to said his son finished a degree in mechanical engineering, but decided the family business was more lucrative.
There’s a reason I usually battle traffic and go to the Old City on every visit, and it’s not just for the bangles. While the bazaar preserves and promotes a long-beloved craft in the modern era, it also helps preserve a slice of Hyderabad’s syncretic culture.
“When you walk through those lanes, it’s such a melting pot of so many different things, and everything has survived,” Pittie said. “I’m not just talking about people from different religions who come together and bring in their own aesthetics, their own culture, their own languages, their own food. They’re all coming together to create this beautiful business hub, which thrives, and to be able to be a part of it, even today — I think it’s amazing.”

Not far from Addis Ababa’s British Embassy, in a quiet residential enclave just off a busy thoroughfare, stands a lovely tree-shaded villa. It’s here that Anna Getaneh opened her boutique, African Mosaique, almost four years ago, in a home her father had built and where she spent some of her childhood years.
Past the garage — now a coffee shop — and the foyer are erstwhile living and dining areas: airy showrooms for a gallery-worthy display of Getaneh’s diaphanous dresses, patterned blazers and colorful accessories, which incorporate traditional Ethiopian fabrics and craftsmanship, filtered through Getaneh’s global lens.
“My starting point is textiles,” she said. “I grew up appreciating fabrics, and what kind of colors and what kind of motifs are worn, and their significance. I always felt that these are such great stories to share and tell.”
Many of the designs on display incorporate shema, an Ethiopian handwoven fabric, and kitenge, the African wax print fabric popular across much of the continent. For example, a brightly colored long dress made of kitenge is priced at 4,500 Ethiopian birr, or about $120, while a white shema woven dress is 3,000 birr, or about $80.
But the fabric is merely a starting point. “I love being able to use basic fabrics and adding value; we do embroidery, we do beading, which is really what our story is here in Africa,” Getaneh said. “You hear about artisanal work in the rest of the world, and that’s luxury — couture is all handmade, for example. Whereas here, that value has never been a given.”
The boutique’s international sensibility makes sense, given that African Mosaique’s origins are many miles and many years removed from its current setting in Ethiopia’s capital.
The daughter of a career diplomat and a fashion designer, Getaneh was born and raised overseas; as a model, she spent nine years working in Paris and New York. It was in New York that she founded the Ethiopian Children’s Fund to build schools in rural Ethiopia, which led to the 1996 opening of a fundraising fashion showcase she named African Mosaique.
“I wanted to do something different. I didn’t want to show images of dying children, of problems, of war and all the turmoil that we have in Africa,” she said. “I wanted to put the spotlight on something positive.”
In the 1990s, the New York iteration of African Mosaique brought together talent from across the continent with Pan-African collectives timed to the end of Paris and New York fashion weeks.
“Initially, it was all about showing that there is fashion in Africa, it was well alive and thriving, and that the only thing is that we didn’t really hear about it in the West,” she said.
Eventually, she returned to Africa — first to Johannesburg, where she opened an African Mosaique boutique in 2005, and then, in 2012, to Addis Ababa, where her brand has grown into a multidimensional force celebrating local materials and workmanship: the boutique, her own in-house label, an annual fashion festival (coming up on Dec. 5), a design hub and a fashion incubator to support up-and-coming talent.
It’s the incubator that Getaneh is particularly proud of, a program designed to help emerging designers on every stage of launching a fashion brand — from skills to production to business plans and beyond.
“With the right opportunity, you can start seeing designers succeed in Africa,” she said. Fifty designers have participated so far, and Getaneh hopes to roll out the program across the continent to empower future generations of African talent with tools to thrive.
“We’re focusing on what are the challenges designers have here, because it’s very similar to what designers in South Africa or West Africa have: lack of proper design schooling, lack of machinery, lack of raw material — even though we have great cotton and leather, most of it is exported.”
Getaneh’s next project is a foundation scheduled to open in January and focused on sustaining traditions.
Her goal, she said, is “making sure that as we grow the fashion design we’re not forgetting our past.”
