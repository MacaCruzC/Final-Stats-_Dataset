Texto completo: Four daily newspapers in Maine, including the Morning Sentinel, will cease production of their Monday print editions as of March 2 in a cost-cutting move to preserve newsroom jobs, according to their CEO.
The Portland Press Herald, Lewiston Sun Journal, Morning Sentinel in Waterville and Kennebec Journal in Augusta each will continue to produce seven distinct editions per week, but their Monday editions only will be available in digital format, said Lisa DeSisto, CEO of Masthead Maine, which publishes the newspapers. Masthead is following an industry trend, spurred by declining print advertising revenue and increased digital news consumption, that has led at least 100 U.S. daily newspapers over the past 15 years to cut the number of print editions they produce each week.
“The savings from digital-only Monday enables us to keep our newsrooms at the size that they are and continue to produce the journalism that’s important to our community,” DeSisto said. “We know that we have a lot of work to do to get a portion of our customers comfortable with this, and

we’re committed to that smooth transition.”
Masthead needs to reduce costs, she said, and the only alternative would be to cut newsroom staffing, which the company doesn’t want to do. DeSisto declined to say how much money Masthead expects to save from the change to digital-only Mondays, but she noted that the bulk of savings would come from reduced paper and distribution costs.
She said Masthead is anticipating a “modest loss” of advertising revenue as a result of the change, but that the cost savings will more than make up for it. About 37% of the company’s revenue came from print advertising in 2019.
No jobs will be eliminated as a result of the change, DeSisto said, although the company expects a reduction in overtime hours for printing press operators, as well as reduced schedules for a few part-time workers. Masthead papers are printed in house but delivered by independent contractors.
Masthead currently delivers major national newspapers such as the New York Times in addition to its own publications. DeSisto said the company will need to work out arrangements with those publishers to either deliver their Monday editions the following day or have them pay the contractor fees for Monday delivery.
The biggest hurdle for Masthead will be assuaging its many print-only subscribers who are used to reading the paper seven days a week. Masthead Group Vice President of Circulation Stefanie Manning said about 70% of the four newspapers’ full-week subscribers have not registered for their digital offerings such as e-papers, mobile apps and websites.
Despite the move to reduce print output by one day a week, the company has no plans to cut the price of a full-week print subscription at any of the four affected newspapers. Instead, Masthead is planning a marketing and communications blitz to help those subscribers get signed up for digital access, Manning said.
“We know there is going to be a segment of our audience that isn’t interested in digital access, or that don’t have access to a computer, an email, (or) the internet in their home,” she said. “We’ll do everything that we can to nurture those customers through the process.”
DeSisto said Masthead, which owns five of Maine’s six daily newspapers, has no immediate plans to reduce print publication any further.
“We are committed to, and value, our print customers,” she said. “We don’t have any plans to further move to (another) digital-only day. How our business unfolds will dictate what’s possible in the future.”
The number of U.S. daily newspapers that print fewer than seven days a week is expected to increase dramatically starting this year, according to the University of North Carolina’s Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. Since 2004, more than 100 newspapers have reduced their frequency of printing by a big enough margin to be reclassified from daily papers (printing three or more editions per week) to weekly papers (printing one or two editions per week), it said.
Major U.S. daily newspapers that have cut back on days with print editions over the past several years include the New Orleans Times-Picayune – one of the first to do so, in 2012 – and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette – one of the most recent, in 2018.
Countless others have reduced their frequency of printing while still remaining dailies, often by eliminating their print editions on Mondays and/or Saturdays – typically the two least profitable days of the week. Masthead chose Monday because it is the company’s weakest day of the week for print advertising, Manning said.
In an August 2019 report on newspaper strategies for reducing print publication days, David Ho of the American Press Institute said communicating with readers and advertisers is critical when eliminating print days. Publishers can use various tactics, from publishing articles, columns and ads, to holding meetings with community and business leaders and one-on-one discussions with subscribers, to help mitigate the loss of subscribers and advertising revenue, Ho said.
It’s important that newspapers prepare adequately for any shift to digital-only content, he said, which includes developing strategies for winning back those who cancel their subscriptions as a result, and dealing with pushback from within the newspaper’s own ranks.
Ho recommended a “deliberate route” to reducing print publication days as part of a larger strategy to promote long-term sustainability, rather than as an act of desperation in response to an alarming balance sheet.
“Cutting alone is not enough to ensure a newspaper will continue to exist and serve its community,” he said in the report. “Publishers need a deeply planned and well-executed strategy, one that acknowledges that reader habits have moved beyond the seven-day daily paper. The approach must also deliver the quality content that audiences demand to the technologies and platforms they currently use.”
According to the report, some industry leaders believe it’s inevitable that most newspapers ultimately will have to cut back print publication to their most profitable days of the week for print advertising — often Sunday, Wednesday and Friday — while producing digital-only content on the other days.
“Most publishers of dailies acknowledge that even in the best of times, there were only three days that were profitable,” with those days effectively subsidizing losses the other days of the week, said Penelope Muse Abernathy, Knight chair of journalism and digital media economics at UNC, in the report.
In an interview Friday, Abernathy said the Sunday paper alone often accounts for 60% of a newspaper’s profit. She said the biggest risk newspapers face when cutting back on unprofitable print days is not the loss of revenue but the possibility of turning off loyal daily readers.
“If you’re going to transition (to digital-only days), you need to think about who your most loyal readers are, and how not to alienate them,” Abernathy said. Other newspapers have employed a variety of tactics, including handing out tablet devices to loyal readers and teaching them how to use the devices, she said.
Masthead is a conglomeration of three discrete companies: MaineToday Media, which owns the Press Herald, the Kennebec Journal, the Morning Sentinel and a commercial printing operation in South Portland; Sun Media Group, which owns the Sun Journal in Lewiston and weeklies including The Forecaster, the American Journal and the Lakes Region Weekly; and Alliance Media Group, which owns the five-days-a-week Times Record in Brunswick and four free weeklies known collectively as the Mainely Media newspapers.
In October, Masthead closed Biddeford’s daily newspaper, the Journal Tribune, after 135 years of publication. Masthead owner Reade Brower has said the paper had been shedding subscribers and advertisers for years before he acquired it in March 2018, and that his company had been unable to turn it around financially.
Brower said Friday that the move to digital-only Mondays is a prudent economic decision that will help build a sustainable model for the company’s newspapers to survive and thrive into the future.
“It allows a lot of things to happen,” he said. “It helps with the labor crunch, and it gives our drivers a day off, which I think will help us retain drivers.”

Texto completo: 2020 needs to be the year in which a vigorous debate about online privacy takes center stage. If that happens, it will be at least partly because California’s pioneering online privacy law went into effect Wednesday. It gives residents the right to be informed about what data is being collected on them; to request that the information be deleted; and to opt out of letting companies sell this information. Businesses with annual sales of less than $25 million that obtain little online information are exempt.
As often happens, the Golden State’s law is likely to be copied by many states and perhaps Congress as well. Unfortunately, the California Consumer Privacy Act is so murky that it is unclear what will result from its implementation. A recent analysis in the Los Angeles Times noted all the unanswered questions about the law: “What does ‘sell’ mean? How can companies be sure they’re deleting the right person’s data? And does simply having a website that keeps track of how many people visit each year mean you must wade into the regulatory thicket?” It’s also plain that the state doesn’t remotely have the resources to monitor the internet and the trillions of interactions that Californians will have online in 2020.
This vagueness — and its traditional corporate arrogance — has already inspired Facebook to announce it won’t change its data-collection policies one bit. But in enforcing the new law, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra shouldn’t be fazed by any company’s deep pockets. A recent series by The New York Times showed that online privacy is a myth. Using information provided by a worker at one of the dozens of companies that track the every movement of consumers to get hints of what they might want to buy, the Times showed how it could track 12 million Americans — including visitors to the White House, to the Pentagon, to celebrities’ homes, to hospitals, to anywhere.
The newspaper’s reporting showed that contrary to claims of companies that the information is anonymized, it’s easy to quickly determine the names of those being tracked by their phones. The Times raised the prospect that controls on this information are so weak that authoritarian governments — or vengeful ex-spouses — could use this data to bully or terrorize people. This may already be happening. The opportunities for blackmail are immense.
In “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” — cited by former President Barack Obama as one of the best books of 2019 — Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff makes the case that the massive store of information that digital companies accumulate on virtually everyone with a phone has created a mutant form of capitalism. As The Guardian wrote, this separates “the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown and unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates into asymmetries of power.”
What will check the emergence of Google and Facebook as de facto global superpowers, seemingly answerable to no one? The world shall see. But at the least, the California Consumer Privacy Act is a landmark sign that tech companies can no longer count on the complacency of those they surveil.

Texto completo: When Rick Welts bought his first home in California he eagerly invited his boss at the time, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern, over to show it off.
So Stern visited. Predictably, he told Welts everything that was wrong with the place.
Welts, now the president of the Golden State Warriors, made all of Stern’s recommended changes — and the house is pretty much perfect. That house was where Welts was on Wednesday when the text message came to say that Stern — his mentor, a second father in many respects — had died.
Stern’s death hit the entire NBA hard, even though the league had been bracing for it in the days since the former commissioner was struck by a brain hemorrhage last month. But for Welts, one of the people fortunate enough to have had an intimately close working relationship with Stern, the loss goes even beyond the level of profound.
“He really lived his life and inspired people around him to constantly reevaluate the way they see the world,” Welts said Friday in a phone interview. “He wanted people to not be afraid to try something different than what we were comfortable with.”
In Welts’ case, that credo rang most true in 2011 when he decided to come out as gay in an article published by The New York Times. He told Stern before the article was printed, and the two men hugged for what Welts believes was the first time.
But the process of knowing Stern would have his back at that ultimate moment started 17 years earlier.
Welts’ partner at that time had died of an AIDS-related issue. Welts, then living in New York, was super-secretive about his personal life and lifestyle. None of his co-workers at the NBA, least of all his boss — Stern — knew that he was gay, or so he thought. So when his partner died, Welts couldn’t tell anyone at work. He took out a death notice advertisement in The Seattle Times, announcing his partner’s death and how memorials could come in the form of donations to a newly created scholarship fund at their alma mater, the University of Washington.
Welts flew to Seattle for the service. He went to the post office and picked up the envelopes from people who sent checks in his partner’s memory. He opened them on the plane ride back to New York. One of them was from Scarsdale, New York, and contained a $10,000 check from David and Dianne Stern.
“Honestly, even to this day, even though we discussed it later, I have no idea how he did that,” Welts said. “I really don’t. I don’t have any idea. We didn’t have the internet. There was no way that one little ad in Seattle, Washington could’ve caught his attention, and he made a gesture that was pretty profound to me because it said a lot without saying anything.”
Welts remembers Stern as a champion for societal change. When he actually told Stern he was gay, Stern’s reaction was akin to saying “so what?” Stern knew it was a big deal, but simply wished it wouldn’t be one. He said he longed for a time where what largely remains earth-shattering news — someone being gay, or a player coming out as gay, or a woman being hired as a coach in a men’s league and a male-dominated field — would be commonplace.
Besides, Welts already knew Stern’s stance on equality matters. Stern wanted to grow the women’s game, so the WNBA was born. When Kobe Bryant directed a gay slur toward a referee in 2011, Stern almost immediately fined him $100,000. The NBA put out PSAs using star players who urged viewers to not use hateful terms. If there was an ail in society that Stern thought the NBA’s platform could reach and repair, he wanted to make it happen.
The last time Welts and Stern saw each other was a few weeks ago. They had lunch at the same restaurant where Stern was when the hemorrhage occurred.
“It’s just hard to imagine a world without him because he’s such a big presence,” Welts said. “I had been very lucky to have had that lunch with him. He’d never been more in his game. He was never more engaged, more excited about everything he was working on, more critical of everything that I was doing. He was 100% himself. It’s kind of a great memory to hold onto because I want to remember him that way.”

Texto completo: US strike on Iranian general was necessary
Donald Trump has shown plenty of forbearance as Iran, reacting to U.S. economic sanctions they have "earned," initiates violence and terror all over the Middle East. And now he has, without any warning, taken out a man who has been a thorn in the side of at least four prior American presidents ("Iranian general killed in US strike," Jan. 3).
Qassem Soleimani and his Quds Force were notoriously behind the shaped-charge devices that took out hundreds of American GIs in Afghanistan and maimed thousands. He was behind all sorts of nefarious activities, not just against the United States but against Sunni Muslims. His presence somewhere could be an indicator of impending chaos and hostilities. He should have known he had "Wanted" posters all over the world.
Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff can complain about not being informed ahead of time, and that is indeed a breach of protocol by Trump. But Pelosi and Schiff have broken all sorts of protocols of their own in their target-lock determination to take down Trump, so perhaps "turnabout is fair play."
In any case, many Iraqis are celebrating. I'm sure they have mixed feelings about having one non-Iraqi government taking out another non-Iraqi troublemaker on their soil, but most seem prepared to look past whatever negative feelings they may have towards Uncle Sam, secure in the notion that a very bad guy is very dead.
Ron BertiOrlando
Election flaws have
little to do with Trump
David Leonhardt's column on our ludicrous process for elections had me nodding my head in agreement until he yielded to the perpetual temptation to bash Donald Trump. In the process of feasting on his hatred of Donald Trump he lost over 40% of the audience.
How do you convince people the process is failing by criticizing a President presiding over a booming economy? Our election process is broken but it's not because Donald Trump won the election, it's because elections do not typically yield the best candidates. In addition, long-term incumbents are motivated to keep things as they are with an entrenched and bloated federal government that is most expert at spending other people's money.
We need an open primary system, term limits, and an elimination of money involved in politics to steer our leadership to competence. Trump is understandably disliked by the "powers that be" what with his bad manners and all, but he's getting results for the ordinary citizen.

Texto completo: The pink-and-black sign. The nondescript exterior. The cramped parking lot.
Even if you've never eaten there, if you live in Lancaster County you know Tony Wang's.
Squeezed into a spot next to a beer distributor on Lincoln Highway East - and seemingly dwarfed by the big signs and bright lights of the nearby outlet malls and tourist attractions - Tony Wang's Chinese restaurant has been a Lancaster County fixture for decades.
2 hotels proposed on Lincoln Highway East, opposite Tanger Outlets; $30M project could create 60 jobs
Given that this local Chinese food institution may be torn down to make way for a new hotel property, we thought we'd take a look into the LNP archives to see what we could learn about the history of Tony Wang's.
(As to the future of Tony Wang's, Wang says he intends to relocate rather than retire, so another chapter of his story is likely to be written.)
Here are 9 things you might not know about this longtime local restaurant and its owner:
1. Wang started his career in a four-star restaurant in New York City
Tony Wang was one of a group of partners who opened a Chinese restaurant on Route 30 East in 1982, but none of them had ever lived in Lancaster County before. The group had run a restaurant called Una Test in Manhattan - which received a four-star review from the New York Times - but the intense competition and skyrocketing rent of the New York restaurant scene led them to seek a calmer locale. Discovering Lancaster County on a drive down from Hershey, they spotted a "for rent" sign on a Lincoln Highway property and decided to take a chance on moving here.
2. The Lincoln Highway restaurant was originally called Tom Chang
One of the original partners lent his name to the restaurant's first incarnation. When Tom Chang opened in June of 1982, a large feature story ran in the Sunday News, which included recipes for two dishes from the restaurant's menu - the stalwart General Tso's Chicken and the elaborate house specialty, Seven Wonder.
Check out those recipes here.
3. Tom Chang was known for its glass kitchen
In an era when Chinese food was still viewed with a little distrust in Lancaster County, the decision to situate the kitchen of Tom Chang behind a massive window at one side of the dining room was a smart one. Customers were encouraged to stand at the window and watch their food being prepared.
4. Wang and his partners were culinary pioneers here
Tom Chang was only the third Chinese restaurant to open in Lancaster County, and the first newspaper interviews with the restaurant's partners focused on the novelty of more authentic Chinese food coming here. In 1982, many Lancaster County residents had little concept of what real Chinese food was. Chow mein, chop suey and egg foo yung were regarded as Chinese food standards here, and the owners of Tom Chang were quick to point out that they had never heard of such dishes in China. (In a later article, Tony Wang's was cited as one of the first local restaurants to serve tofu.)
5. They had to make their food less spicy to suit the local palate
Part of being a culinary pioneer is learning your audience. When the Tom Chang's team decided to move to Lancaster, they spent several weeks meeting local people and eating at local restaurants. They decided to alter the basic menu items, dialing back the spice level to accommodate Lancaster County diners. However, they always pointed out that they would adjust spice levels up or down for any dish on request.
6. Tom Chang also had a downtown location
In March of 1985, Tom Chang opened a second spot in downtown Lancaster, appropriately named Tom Chang's Downtown. Squeezed into a tiny lunch-counter space at 51 W. King St., the restaurant was aimed squarely at the take-out market, with no tables and only a handful of counter stools for seating. Tony Wang, Cecil Wang (no relation) and Freddy Su ran the restaurant, which was renamed A Wok a year later. It continued under that name for years, even after Tony Wang moved on.
7. Tony Wang was trained as an interior designer
At the age of 2, Tony Wang fled the communist takeover of mainland China with his family, relocating to Taiwan. He grew up there, and went to school to become an interior designer. When he moved to New York City in 1979 to work in Tom Chang's restaurant there, he learned the food business, starting as a waiter, then learning to cook and manage a business. However, he still got to flex his design muscles at times - he was responsible for the interior of the original Tom Chang on Lincoln Highway, for instance.
Tony Wang might need to move but isn’t ready to retire after 4 decades in restaurant business
8. He once had a restaurant on Columbia Avenue
Tony and Cecil Wang (again, no relation) opened another restaurant in 1988 on Columbia Avenue, in a building that had formerly housed Gino's Italian Restaurant and is now occupied by Dominion Pizza. Simply called Wang's, the focus was once again on sit-down service, rather than the take-out business of A Wok.
9. He finally opened his own restaurant under his own name in 1992
After a full decade in the Lancaster County restaurant scene, Tony Wang finally opened his own business - with no partners except for his wife, Patricia - in 1992. He went back to the original location of Tom Chang on Lincoln Highway East, which had since been occupied by Chinese restaurants called Empire Szechuan and Asia Garden. He completely renovated the interior (using his designer skills again), developed a new menu and hung that distinctive pink sign out front.
He also revived a Tom Chang concept that had been discarded: He brought back the glass kitchen, once again inviting his customers to watch the process of Chinese cooking.
Over the years, Wang said in this 1992 interview, he noticed one change that speaks volumes about the extent to which Lancaster County embraced Hunan and Szechuan style Chinese food: "Ten years ago, only a few people asked for spicy dishes," he said. "Now everyone wants it spicy."

Actually, men loved Little Women

Texto completo: When I took my fiance to see Little Women with me, I feared that we were about to have two different experiences.
I, having both read the book growing up and adored the 1994 film adaption, would sit crying in the theater, and he, having absolutely no familiarity with the story, would turn charitably toward me afterward and say, “That was nice.”
Instead, he loved it.
After the film ended, we walked out of the theater talking about how Little Women dealt with women's issues in a way that didn’t feel partisan or preachy and how it also touched on universal themes such as grief, family, and finding your calling.
We all wrestle with those experiences, though women experience them in our own way. That doesn’t make Little Women a “chick flick.”
Nevertheless, I’m willing to entertain the idea that it’s not for all men. Little Women does not, however, have a men “problem,” as writers at the Washington Post and the New York Times have proclaimed. Most men aren’t interested in it, and that’s not the result of some offshoot of the patriarchy.
There is a legitimate concern that the star-studded, beautifully shot, and brilliantly directed film will be snubbed this awards season. The male powers that be in Hollywood may not be its biggest fans. But when it comes to the film’s broader audience, that’s not the case at all.
In fact, 39% of moviegoers were men. Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern, a man, named Little Women one of the best films of the year. In his review, he called it “an ostensible women’s film that should appeal equally to men, if they’ll give it a chance. Enormous emotions know no gender.”
Overzealous feminist writers may complain that men have “fragile masculinity” or some complex that keeps them from going to see a film about women, but that really isn’t the case. The film has made more than $50 million thanks to many women who read the book as children (e.g., me) and some new (male) fans.
But instead of giving the film its due, some conservative commentators, from Washington Post contributor and Rebeller editor-in-chief Sonny Bunch to National Review’s Kyle Smith, have gone out of their way to proclaim that men don’t have to go see it. “It’s a peculiar feature of our culture that men who behave in predictably masculine ways find themselves chastised and scolded for not being more feminine,” Smith wrote.
Of course, men shouldn’t be scolded for not seeing the movie. But that misses the point.
Men can enjoy Little Women for a variety of reasons. One, it will help them understand women better, and hasn’t that been their great desire for a millennium? Two, it is not actually just for women. Yes, Louisa May Alcott herself said she didn’t find the story too interesting — “So I plod away,” she wrote in her diary, “although I don’t enjoy this sort of thing” — but director Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of the classic novel is a beautifully rendered film that touches on not just “women’s issues” but human nature.
Entertainment reporter Kevin Fallon wrote that Gerwig “finds impeccable ways to tap into the specificity of how gender impacts her lead characters, but also the universality of their ambitions.”
In A Handful of Authors, English philosopher G.K. Chesterton wrote that one iconic scene in Alcott’s Little Women, the German professor’s proposal to Jo, was “one of the really human things in human literature.” He added that “when you read it you feel sure that human beings have experienced it often.”
Apparently, lots of men agreed with Chesterton, and they certainly showed up to movie theaters. So those complaining that men were afraid to see Little Women were wrong. But those protesting that men needn’t be interested in seeing the film also missed the point.
The conversation surrounding Little Women points to a larger trend in discussions about feminism between liberals and conservatives. Liberals overshoot their arguments, contending not only that women’s issues matter but that men must be concerned with them to any extent that feminists demand. Then conservatives reflexively reply that they don’t have to pay attention to women’s stuff and that it’s a free country, by golly!
It’s too bad they can’t meet in the middle. There’s a great movie there.

‘Dumbest man in Iran’: Thomas Friedman mocks Qassem Soleimani

Texto completo: New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman asserted Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani showed ineptitude in his efforts to prop up Iran.
Friedman mocked the military leader, who was killed Thursday in a U.S. drone strike, as a “military genius” who drove his country into the ground as he sought to broaden Iran’s power in the Middle East.
“One day they may name a street after President Trump in Tehran. Why? Because Trump just ordered the assassination of possibly the dumbest man in Iran and the most overrated strategist in the Middle East,” Friedman wrote of Soleimani.
Friedman said the leader of the Quds Force miscalculated after the Iran nuclear deal when he and Iran’s supreme leader sought control through their proxies of several cities in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. U.S. allies urged the Trump administration to respond to Iran’s actions, and the deal, which Friedman referred to as a “great deal” for Iran, was eventually revoked by Trump.
The deal agreed to by the Obama administration and Iran in 2015 lifted sanctions on the country and helped grow its economy. When the Trump administration reinforced the sanctions, Iran raised its gas prices, prompting massive protests and brutal crackdowns, “further weakening the legitimacy of the regime,” Friedman wrote.
“Today’s Iran is the heir to a great civilization and the home of an enormously talented people and significant culture. Wherever Iranians go in the world today, they thrive as scientists, doctors, artists, writers and filmmakers — except in the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose most famous exports are suicide bombing, cyberterrorism and proxy militia leaders. The very fact that Suleimani was probably the most famous Iranian in the region speaks to the utter emptiness of this regime, and how it has wasted the lives of two generations of Iranians by looking for dignity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways,” the columnist wrote.
Soleimani’s proxies prevented any of the countries they inhabited from developing infrastructure such as schools, roads, and electricity, Friedman said, leading Soleimani’s “kingmakers” to be hated in the region “even more so than Trump’s America.”
Friedman also said that when Soleimani confronted Israel, he was unprepared for the strength of Israeli forces, and even though he helped fight the Islamic State, he was responsible for its rise by Iran’s overreach in Iraq.

Time has come to reckon with online privacy

Texto completo: 2020 needs to be the year in which a vigorous debate about online privacy takes center stage. If that happens, it will be at least partly because California’s pioneering online privacy law went into effect Wednesday. It gives residents the right to be informed about what data is being collected on them; to request that the information be deleted; and to opt out of letting companies sell this information. Businesses with annual sales of less than $25 million that obtain little online information are exempt.
As often happens, the Golden State’s law is likely to be copied by many states and perhaps Congress as well. Unfortunately, the California Consumer Privacy Act is so murky that it is unclear what will result from its implementation. A recent analysis in the Los Angeles Times noted all the unanswered questions about the law: “What does ‘sell’ mean? How can companies be sure they’re deleting the right person’s data? And does simply having a website that keeps track of how many people visit each year mean you must wade into the regulatory thicket?” It’s also plain that the state doesn’t remotely have the resources to monitor the internet and the trillions of interactions that Californians will have online in 2020.
This vagueness — and its traditional corporate arrogance — has already inspired Facebook to announce it won’t change its data-collection policies one bit. But in enforcing the new law, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra shouldn’t be fazed by any company’s deep pockets. A recent series by The New York Times showed that online privacy is a myth. Using information provided by a worker at one of the dozens of companies that track the every movement of consumers to get hints of what they might want to buy, the Times showed how it could track 12 million Americans — including visitors to the White House, to the Pentagon, to celebrities’ homes, to hospitals, to anywhere.
The newspaper’s reporting showed that contrary to claims of companies that the information is anonymized, it’s easy to quickly determine the names of those being tracked by their phones. The Times raised the prospect that controls on this information are so weak that authoritarian governments — or vengeful ex-spouses — could use this data to bully or terrorize people. This may already be happening. The opportunities for blackmail are immense.
In “The Age of Surveillance Capitalism” — cited by former President Barack Obama as one of the best books of 2019 — Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff makes the case that the massive store of information that digital companies accumulate on virtually everyone with a phone has created a mutant form of capitalism. As The Guardian wrote, this separates “the citizens in all societies into two groups: the watchers (invisible, unknown and unaccountable) and the watched. This has profound consequences for democracy because asymmetry of knowledge translates into asymmetries of power.”
What will check the emergence of Google and Facebook as de facto global superpowers, seemingly answerable to no one? The world shall see. But at the least, the California Consumer Privacy Act is a landmark sign that tech companies can no longer count on the complacency of those they surveil.

Texto completo: To preserve newsroom jobs, the Portland Press Herald, Lewiston Sun Journal, Morning Sentinel and Kennebec Journal will discontinue Monday print editions starting March 2.

Four daily newspapers in Maine, including the Kennebec Journal, will cease production of their Monday print editions as of March 2 in a cost-cutting move to preserve newsroom jobs, according to their CEO.
The Portland Press Herald, Lewiston Sun Journal, Morning Sentinel in Waterville and Kennebec Journal in Augusta each will continue to produce seven distinct editions per week, but their Monday editions only will be available in digital format, said Lisa DeSisto, CEO of Masthead Maine, which publishes the newspapers. Masthead is following an industry trend, spurred by declining print advertising revenue and increased digital news consumption, that has led at least 100 U.S. daily newspapers over the past 15 years to cut the number of print editions they produce each week.
“The savings from digital-only Monday enables us to keep our newsrooms at the size that they are and continue to produce the journalism that’s important to our community,” DeSisto said. “We know that we have a lot of work to do to get a portion of our customers comfortable with this, and we’re committed to that smooth transition.”
Masthead needs to reduce costs, she said, and the only alternative would be to cut newsroom staffing, which the company doesn’t want to do. DeSisto declined to say how much money Masthead expects to save from the change to digital-only Mondays, but she noted that the bulk of savings would come from reduced paper and distribution costs.
She said Masthead is anticipating a “modest loss” of advertising revenue as a result of the change, but that the cost savings will more than make up for it. About 37% of the company’s revenue came from print advertising in 2019.
No jobs will be eliminated as a result of the change, DeSisto said, although the company expects a reduction in overtime hours for printing press operators, as well as reduced schedules for a few part-time workers. Masthead papers are printed in house but delivered by independent contractors.
Masthead currently delivers major national newspapers such as the New York Times in addition to its own publications. DeSisto said the company will need to work out arrangements with those publishers to either deliver their Monday editions the following day or have them pay the contractor fees for Monday delivery.
The biggest hurdle for Masthead will be assuaging its many print-only subscribers who are used to reading the paper seven days a week. Masthead Group Vice President of Circulation Stefanie Manning said about 70% of the four newspapers’ full-week subscribers have not registered for their digital offerings such as e-papers, mobile apps and websites.
Despite the move to reduce print output by one day a week, the company has no plans to cut the price of a full-week print subscription at any of the four affected newspapers. Instead, Masthead is planning a marketing and communications blitz to help those subscribers get signed up for digital access, Manning said.
“We know there is going to be a segment of our audience that isn’t interested in digital access, or that don’t have access to a computer, an email, (or) the internet in their home,” she said. “We’ll do everything that we can to nurture those customers through the process.”
DeSisto said Masthead, which owns five of Maine’s six daily newspapers, has no immediate plans to reduce print publication any further.
“We are committed to, and value, our print customers,” she said. “We don’t have any plans to further move to (another) digital-only day. How our business unfolds will dictate what’s possible in the future.”
The number of U.S. daily newspapers that print fewer than seven days a week is expected to increase dramatically starting this year, according to the University of North Carolina’s Center for Innovation and Sustainability in Local Media. Since 2004, more than 100 newspapers have reduced their frequency of printing by a big enough margin to be reclassified from daily papers (printing three or more editions per week) to weekly papers (printing one or two editions per week), it said.
Major U.S. daily newspapers that have cut back on days with print editions over the past several years include the New Orleans Times-Picayune —one of the first to do so, in 2012 — and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — one of the most recent, in 2018.
Countless others have reduced their frequency of printing while still remaining dailies, often by eliminating their print editions on Mondays and/or Saturdays – typically the two least profitable days of the week. Masthead chose Monday because it is the company’s weakest day of the week for print advertising, Manning said.
In an August 2019 report on newspaper strategies for reducing print publication days, David Ho of the American Press Institute said communicating with readers and advertisers is critical when eliminating print days. Publishers can use various tactics, from publishing articles, columns and ads, to holding meetings with community and business leaders and one-on-one discussions with subscribers, to help mitigate the loss of subscribers and advertising revenue, Ho said.
It’s important that newspapers prepare adequately for any shift to digital-only content, he said, which includes developing strategies for winning back those who cancel their subscriptions as a result, and dealing with pushback from within the newspaper’s own ranks.
Ho recommended a “deliberate route” to reducing print publication days as part of a larger strategy to promote long-term sustainability, rather than as an act of desperation in response to an alarming balance sheet.
“Cutting alone is not enough to ensure a newspaper will continue to exist and serve its community,” he said in the report. “Publishers need a deeply planned and well-executed strategy, one that acknowledges that reader habits have moved beyond the seven-day daily paper. The approach must also deliver the quality content that audiences demand to the technologies and platforms they currently use.”
According to the report, some industry leaders believe it’s inevitable that most newspapers ultimately will have to cut back print publication to their most profitable days of the week for print advertising — often Sunday, Wednesday and Friday — while producing digital-only content on the other days.
“Most publishers of dailies acknowledge that even in the best of times, there were only three days that were profitable,” with those days effectively subsidizing losses the other days of the week, said Penelope Muse Abernathy, Knight chair of journalism and digital media economics at UNC, in the report.
In an interview Friday, Abernathy said the Sunday paper alone often accounts for 60% of a newspaper’s profit. She said the biggest risk newspapers face when cutting back on unprofitable print days is not the loss of revenue but the possibility of turning off loyal daily readers.
Masthead is a conglomeration of three discrete companies: MaineToday Media, which owns the Press Herald, the Kennebec Journal, the Morning Sentinel and a commercial printing operation in South Portland; Sun Media Group, which owns the Sun Journal in Lewiston and weeklies including The Forecaster, the American Journal and the Lakes Region Weekly; and Alliance Media Group, which owns the five-days-a-week Times Record in Brunswick and four free weeklies known collectively as the Mainely Media newspapers.
In October, Masthead closed Biddeford’s daily newspaper, the Journal Tribune, after 135 years of publication. Masthead owner Reade Brower has said the paper had been shedding subscribers and advertisers for years before he acquired it in March 2018, and that his company had been unable to turn it around financially.
Brower said Friday that the move to digital-only Mondays is a prudent economic decision that will help build a sustainable model for the company’s newspapers to survive and thrive into the future.
“It allows a lot of things to happen,” he said. “It helps with the labor crunch, and it gives our drivers a day off, which I think will help us retain drivers.”

A New York Times column on ‘Jewish genius’ draws criticism for linking to a debunked University of Utah study

Texto completo: When it was first published last week, a controversial New York Times column about “the secrets of Jewish genius” linked to a 2005 study from a researcher labeled “an extremist,” revered by white supremacists and discredited by scientists — and who, for years, worked as a distinguished professor at the University of Utah.
Citing the late U. anthropologist Henry Harpending, expectedly, touched off criticism. Hours after it appeared online, The Times’ commentary was updated with an editor’s note saying it had been a mistake to mention the study, which has been widely questioned and long seen as an argument of racial superiority.
The note suggests that conservative columnist Bret Stephens did not know that Harpending promoted racist ideas. It also says Stephens “was not endorsing the study or its authors’ views” but acknowledges that his reference to the research, nevertheless, left “an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior. That was not his intent.”
The paragraph Stephens wrote about Harpending’s research has since been deleted online. And on Friday, the University of Utah deleted a complimentary memorial post from its Department of Anthropology that had said Harpending’s “scholarly and personal footprint will be long lasting in the field.”
The U. also noted in response to the column that none of the three authors of the paper — Harpending, Gregory Cochran or then-student Jason Hardy — work at the school any longer. Harpending was there from 1997 until he died of a stroke in 2016.
“Statements attributed to Henry Harpending that promote ideas in line with white nationalist ideology stand in direct opposition to the University of Utah’s values of equity, diversity and inclusion ... " said Annalisa Purser, the university’s spokeswoman.
“As such, we will meet these words with ours: Racist views and rhetoric that position one race as superior to another are inaccurate and harmful," she said. "The University of Utah is bolstered by its diversity, which allows individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives to come together to address challenges in new and creative ways.”
Neither Cochran nor Hardy could not be reached by The Salt Lake Tribune for comment. It’s unclear why none of the researchers faced censure while at the university for publishing the piece, though Purser added, “Speech — even when it is racist — is protected by the U.S. Constitution and is necessary for the free exchange of ideas.”
Meanwhile, the citation has reignited a debate about the genetics of race at a time when anti-Semitism is on the rise across the nation. It was posted shortly before several people were stabbed at a rabbi’s home in New York on the seventh day of Hanukkah.
“This has been a very painful time already for Jews in the United States,” said Amy Spiro, a Jewish journalist whose work has been published in Variety, Jewish Insider and The Jerusalem Post. “And then this column came out,” she told The Tribune in a phone interview. “It’s just generated a lot of controversy. It doesn’t seem like this is helpful in any way.”
Why Bret. Why?!https://t.co/BQ7WYnN9lw
— Amy Spiro (@AmySpiro) December 29, 2019
In their disputed study, the U. researchers focused on Ashkenazi Jews, or those who settled in central and Eastern Europe (as opposed to Spain or the Middle East). Among supremacists, the group is often seen as “pure” because many are white.
Harpending, Cochran and Hardy argue that Ashkenazi Jews have higher IQs, on average, than the general public (including other “non-Ashkenazi Jews”). Their theory is that in medieval times, individuals in the faith group in Europe were pushed into finance jobs “because of the Christian prohibition of usury,” or lending money for interest. Over time, many became rich and had more surviving children than poorer families who worked on farms. They also married within the community and stayed fairly isolated.
“This is a multi-step argument that could be questioned at virtually every turn,” commented Matthew Yglesias, a writer for Vox who criticized Stephens for citing the study.
The University of Utah has long been known as an expert in genetic research, but this paper — “Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence” — is typically seen as a low point in that expertise. The authors created their own algorithm for determining genetic makeup and cited several scientists also viewed as racist.
The researchers have been criticized on and off since the study came out in 2005 and was published in The Journal of Biosocial Science the next year; that publication was previously called The Eugenics Review up until the 1970s. Eugenics is the controversial pseudo-science popular among Nazis for improving the human race by forced sterilization of poor people.
In a 2005 piece on the professors’ Ashkenazi Jewish intelligence study in The Times, a former colleague of Harpending and a researcher at Harvard said: “It would be hard to overstate how politically incorrect this paper is.” Harpending responded: “Absolutely anything in human biology that is interesting is going to be controversial.”
The Times’ piece on the study was largely uncritical beyond that; it was written by reporter Nicholas Wade, who later wrote his own book on genetics that shares some ideas with Harpending and Cochran. (Cochran had previously written about incorrect claims that being gay was caused by an infectious disease.)
A story in New York Magazine was much more condemning of the hypotheses brought up in the 2005 research. “I’d actually call the study bull----,” said one quoted historian at Emory University, “if I didn’t feel its ideas were so insulting.”
The head of New York University’s human-genetics program said: “It’s bad science — not because it’s provocative, but because it’s bad genetics and bad epidemiology.”
In a 2007 press release about later research by Harpending, the school acknowledged his 2005 paper had “created a stir” and that critics had questioned “the quality of the science.”
Harpending continued to speak, though, including at white supremacist conferences, about his also inaccurate ideas that black people are genetically prone to be lazy. His profile on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s page lists him as a white nationalist and an extremist who believed in eugenics.
“In other words, as an anthropologist looking around the world,” he said in 2009 at the “Preserving Western Civilization” conference, “what I see is that men work and produce things when they’re forced into it, and when they’re not, they quit. And I’m thinking about, you know tribes in central Africa, but you know it’s true in Baltimore too, right?”
His obituary noted he came to Utah from Pennsylvania State University after earning his doctorate at Harvard.
Stephens, who is Jewish, ultimately argues in his column that there’s a cultural — not genetic — explanation for Jewish genius, stemming from Judaism’s religious tradition of encouraging believers to “not only observe and obey but also discuss and disagree.” He also believes group members became more innovative and creative by typically being in the minority wherever they’ve lived.
His original mention of the study read: “The common answer is that Jews are, or tend to be, smart. When it comes to Ashkenazi Jews, it’s true. ‘Ashkenazi Jews have the highest average I.Q. of any ethnic group for which there are reliable data,’ noted one 2005 paper. ‘During the 20th century, they made up about 3 percent of the U.S. population but won 27 percent of the U.S. Nobel science prizes and 25 percent of the ACM Turing awards. They account for more than half of world chess champions.’”
That data on awards is not technically wrong, though it broadly counts anyone as Jewish who has a grandparent with ancestry in the faith.
Stephens mentioned Albert Einstein and Franz Kafka and Karl Marx as prime examples of Jewish intelligence, before asking: “How is it that a people who never amounted to even one-third of 1 percent of the world’s population contributed so seminally to so many of its most pathbreaking ideas and innovations?”
Then he brought up the U. research as proof. Dan Kennedy, an associate professor at Northeastern’s School of Journalism in Massachusetts, questions how Stephens even found the study, noting it is 15 years old and has been debunked.
Bret Stephens’ column appeared IN PRINT (without the offending link, of course). Under what ethical rule does the @NYTimes get to edit it this late in the cycle, even *with* an editor’s note?
— Dan Kennedy (@dankennedy_nu) December 29, 2019
His use of the paper is “just stunning,” Kennedy told The Tribune, saying the study was obviously a main tenet of Stephens’ argument, and not a minor point, like the editor’s note suggests. “I think it should have been killed before it ever got published.”
In the later edits, all references to Ashkenazi Jews (which also appeared in two other places in the column) were removed. Many have questioned why Stephens referred to Ashkenazi Jews at all if he didn’t agree with the paper and was generally talking about Jewish culture, and not superiority.
“What was even the point of the column?” Spiro asked. “It’s confusing.”
Stephens joined The Times in 2017, after winning a Pulitzer Prize for his work at The Wall Street Journal in 2013 and serving as editor in chief of The Jerusalem Post. He has previously come under fire for bullying a professor who called him a “bedbug.”
Some have called for his resignation, particularly liberal readers who disagree with his more conservative pieces, but Kennedy believes the “Jewish genius” piece is a new low. The associate professor, who teaches ethics in journalism at Northeastern, said the commentary needed more than an editor’s note about the concerns raised.

Texto completo: A few years ago, Angela Evans decided she wanted to test the DNA of her 10-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son. She was interested in knowing whether they had a mutation of the MTHFR gene, as she does. The mutation is linked to a number of disorders — women with the mutation may have a higher risk of having babies with defects like spina bifida — and Ms. Evans wanted to make life changes for her children based on the results.
When doctors told her they didn’t think there was a medical need to test her children, she decided to use 23andMe, the direct-to-customer genetic testing company.
To use 23andMe’s services, the user simply sends in a saliva sample. Within five weeks the company returns the results, without the mediation of a doctor or genetic counselor.
Along with finding out that both her children had a mutation of the MTHFR gene, she also received 23andMe’s analysis of her children’s genetic susceptibility to a number of adult-onset diseases, including Parkinson’s. Ms. Evans shared the results with her children, family members and friends.
Then she uploaded their DNA data to MyHeritage and GEDmatch hoping to learn more about the family’s genealogy. Sites like GEDmatch and others are “open-source databases” on which people freely share their DNA online, usually in the hopes of finding long-lost relatives.
Ms. Evans is not alone in testing her children’s DNA. While 23andMe does not track how many of its kits have been used to test children, there’s a growing interest in genotyping children. And though 23andMe says its service is intended for adults, with its ads featuring animated characters, it appears to be marketing to children too. Similarly, the home testing companies Orig3n and Map My Gene market test kits specifically for testing children.
The problem with these tests is twofold. First, parents are testing their children in ways that could have serious implications as they grow older — and they are not old enough to consent. Second, by sharing their children’s genetic information on public websites, parents are forever exposing their personal health data.
[If you’re online — and, well, you are — chances are someone is using your information. We’ll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter .]
Upon a finding that they are at high risk for a disease, children may face negative consequences in school, the workplace and the insurance market — not to mention experience fear and anxiety about their impending fate.
“Not every child has the maturity to understand what things mean, and that could be an unfair burden on a kid whose whole life is ahead of him,” Dr. Naomi Laventhal, a neonatologist at the University of Michigan, has said.
Put simply, when parents test their children’s DNA before they are old enough to truly consent, those children lose their right not to know certain information. This is significant because, as Justice John Paul Stevens articulated in his 1977 Whalen v. Roe decision, there are two key components of the right to privacy: “the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,” and “the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.”
In keeping with this standard, children should have the autonomy to decide to learn more about their genetic sequence only when and if they are interested.
In addition to the right to know or not to know the information in the first place, the corresponding right to prevent disclosure is a key issue in the case of home testing kits.
“Sharenting” — the phenomenon of sharing photographs, embarrassing stories and other personal information about one’s children online — has become commonplace. But in countries like France and Austria, children can sue their own parents for putting their childhood on display without their permission.
While this may seem extreme for mere pictures or stories, there is nothing more intimate and personal than a person’s DNA. Yet parents innocently share this information online — on the DNA sites, but also through blogs or Facebook groups — and often when their children’s results turn up something unexpected, like a surprising paternity result.
Dr. Louanne Hudgins, a geneticist at Stanford, cautions parents to consider the long-term privacy of their child’s health information collected through home genetic kits. Their children’s DNA and other health data, she has warned, could be sold to other companies — marketing firms, data brokers, insurance companies — in the same way that social media sites and search engines collect and share data about their users.
Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics strongly discourage the use of home-kit genetic testing of children.
The sharing of DNA results on open-source genealogy databases to find long-lost relatives poses another privacy risk: When parents share their children’s DNA on these sites, they are effectively sharing it with the world, including with the government and law enforcement investigators.
For example, law enforcement officials can compare DNA from crime scenes with DNA pulled from open-source websites. Even if parents attempt to keep their accounts anonymous, it is often not difficult for investigators to identify them and their children if anyone — even a relative as distant as a third cousin — has made a personal profile public.
Genetic privacy is just one part of a larger conversation about children’s privacy. While we have laws to protect children from third parties sharing children’s personal information online, these laws don’t apply when a parent does the sharing, or consents to allowing someone else to do it. This is because we have a legal tradition of allowing parents to determine what is in the best interests of their children.
But we find ourselves in a new era in which technology is outpacing most parents’ digital literacy. When parents upload their children’s test results to third-party sites, they likely do not consider the many possible consequences — some of which are listed only in the fine print of privacy policies most people never read.
Changing our laws to police parents or increase lawsuits, as in France and Austria, is most likely not the answer. Most parents share information online because they are proud of their children, not because they don’t care about their privacy. Rather than punishing parents with court battles, we should mount an educational campaign that would make disclosing children’s DNA information less socially acceptable.
The job of parents is to protect and nurture their children to the best of their ability. This should mean protecting the privacy of their DNA as well.

David Brooks: A ridiculously optimistic history of the next decade

Texto completo: Looking back at the 2020s from our vantage point in 2030, the first great event was the complete destruction of Donald Trump’s Republican Party. As the former Republican consultant Mike Murphy had noticed, there were roughly 300 state and federal elections during the Trump years and Republicans did horribly in most of them. The 2020 vote was a continuation of that trend. Trump’s landslide defeat left him humiliated, and the Republicans lost their Senate majority.
Trump cried fraud and tried to whip up his followers, but they turned their backs. He went from idol to scapegoat in an instant. It seemed they could forgive him everything but losing. Many temporarily retreated from political life, the way evangelical Christians did after the ignominy of the Scopes trial.
President Joe Biden faced an interesting dynamic in his party. The political power was with moderates. The intellectual power was with the left. People of color, whose views were largely more moderate, became the crucial swing faction.
As president, Biden resisted the interest groups that wanted him to address health care first. Instead, he did child and earned-income tax credits, infrastructure, expanded early childhood education, expanded prison reform, and so on — what some writers called “reparations by any other name.” He gave regulatory czar Elizabeth Warren a special portfolio to take on Big Tech.
The major events of the decade were cultural, not political. The Trump era had witnessed a crisis of connection at the bottom of society and a crisis of authority at the top. Social repair was the top order of the day once a new president took office.
The first whiff of the cultural restoration was the “Accountability Clubs” that spread across the nation’s campuses. College students realized that America stinks at accountability. Either there is no accountability (Wall Street after the financial crisis) or people have their lives destroyed for a “problematic” tweet.
The Accountability Clubs bore the motto “Truth and Mercy.” Students wanted to restore a culture in which facts mattered. They were also searching for a way to judge others in a graduated and humane manner, allowing for repentance, forgiveness and restoration. Marshall McLuhan once remarked that “moral indignation is a technique used to endow an idiot with dignity.” Suddenly indignation, the keystone emotion of the Trump years, was lame. Empathy made a comeback.
The second cultural trend of the decade was the rise of the urban church. Suburban megachurch attendance fell, because the pastors had disgraced themselves under Trump. But suddenly there was a surge in church plants in places like Brooklyn, Washington, D.C., Chicago and San Francisco, as highly educated people found homes for their spiritual longings.
The churches were liturgically highly charismatic (Bethel music) and highly universalistic and intellectual (Richard Rohr). Their politics were an odd mix — pro-LGBTQ, pro-life, active on climate change, pro-animal rights (one of the signature moral causes of the decade). The religious left gained on the religious right.
At the same time, the racial justice conversation went intimate. America is involved in a multigenerational process of truth and reconciliation. In the teens, the truth-telling had generally revolved around historic events — slavery, lynching, redlining. In the 2020s, a series of writers, artists and directors gave us vivid descriptions of the subtleties of contemporary black life.
The profusion of video streaming networks allowed a new generation of artists to take audiences inside the psychological lives of people of color. These artists realized that structural change would happen when people learned to see one another whole.
The most important cultural change came to be known as the Civic Renaissance. During the first two decades of the century, hundreds of thousands of new civic organizations came into being — healing political divides, fighting homelessness, promoting social mobility and weaving communities. But these organizations were small. They did not grow into the big national chapter-based structures that had repaired America’s social fabric a century earlier — the YMCA, the Rotary, the Boy Scouts.
By the 2020s, philanthropists and community builders realized the only way to change culture and weave the social fabric was by creating an AFL-CIO of civil society, with big national voices and large, decentralized national organizations so that people across America had easy and practical pathways to get involved in community revival.
In the 2010s, it seemed like the liberal order was cracking up. In the 2020s, that feeling vanished. The decline of the Chinese economy delegitimized the authoritarian model. It turns out you can’t run a centrally controlled economy without a lot of waste, corruption and riot police.
Meanwhile, the American political system began to work better. The GOP re-emerged under Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio as a better version of a working-class party — socially right, economically left. Democrats remained dominant through the decade. Their party’s biggest accomplishment was in foreign affairs — the repair of America’s alliances and the restoration of global American leadership.
Americans were more collaborative in the 2020s. And the New York Mets won the World Series every single year.

Kurt Kragthorpe: A football coach’s kid who wound up as a sportswriter would never happen now, but it worked out all right for me

Texto completo: On the second-to-last day of my full-time work in the newspaper business, Utah football coach Kyle Whittingham publicly, and graciously, mentioned our slice of shared history as teenagers whose fathers coached together. That's when it hit me again: This whole thing never should have happened.
In what universe could a college football coach's son become a sportswriter, chronicling and critiquing the performances of … coaches?
Whatever minor distinction I may have carved out in 42 years and eight months of having stories appear in four daily papers in Utah, my family background forever will make me the youngest member of an unusual group. It consists of two people.
The only person who matches my description is Terry Frei, a longtime sports columnist and author. His father, Jerry, was Oregon's football coach from 1967-71.
My father, Dave, coached Oregon State's football team in the late '80s. Terry and I happily would accept new members, but we're not expecting anyone to apply. In the modern climate of relationships between coaches and the media, there's absolutely no way a coach's kid would go to the other side.
Somehow, in a bygone era, our dads allowed it to happen.
Good thing for me, because I never imagined doing anything else during a career that ended with Tuesday’s Alamo Bowl — except for occasional Utah golf coverage I’ll continue to do for The Salt Lake Tribune and Fairways Media.
Being a coach’s kid in this business has created a weird dynamic, considering I would end up covering my dad’s former boss (LaVell Edwards), a player he recruited to OSU (Bronco Mendenhall) and my high school baseball teammate (Whittingham). More on them later. Back to my story.
In the University of Montana’s kindergarten lab school, I remember being assigned to draw a picture and dictate a story to a student teacher. Other kids were creating tales of fire trucks responding to calls; I was drawing a scoreboard and previewing the Grizzlies’ basketball game.
And then in high school, due to my father’s friendship with the sports editor — again, a strange phenomenon, looking back — I got a job in The Daily Herald newsroom, taking wire copy off the teletype every morning and regularly writing stories. After being sent to cover a Provo-Orem high school soccer game (2-0, Tigers) and seeing the story in print, I was hooked.
What other job could provide such immediate results of your efforts? Other than, you know, coaching?
And so it continued for four-plus decades, in Provo, Logan and two stops in Salt Lake City, ending with 29 years at The Tribune, the publication I was pictured reading in my high school yearbook. After I posted that photo recently, someone suggested my life would have been altered if I had been reading The New York Times.
It also crossed my mind that I could have worn a green jacket in the golf team picture. I'm just happy to have walked Augusta National, from outside the ropes.
In any case, none of those Utah newspapers’ headquarters is in the location where I started working, as just one example of an evolving business. I often joke that I wish I had been born much later into a coaching family, considering Gary Andersen made about 25 times more money as Oregon State’s coach than my father did, with fewer wins. But I’m lucky to have lasted this long in my own profession, blessed to have a wife (Sandra) who took care of everything while all I thought about was the next story, and to have done it all in Utah.
That's how I came to cover Edwards, Mendenhall and Whittingham, with every case resulting in what I would describe as very professional dealings. Working with Whittingham has been especially interesting.
He was quite angry for a few months about my criticism of his famous onside kick in 2007 with a 43-0 lead over Wyoming, accusing me of using a “Bully Pulpit” as a columnist. He eventually got over that grudge; it helped that Utah went 13-0 the following season.
I never did explain to him that he was misusing “bully” in that context, but I've helped him the past two seasons while being assigned to the Utah athletics beat. Our dozens of interactions have consisted almost strictly of formal questions and answers, with hardly any joking or small talk. Somehow, though, I became his “vocabulary guy.” About every other week, he would say something in a news conference and immediately check with me, out loud: “Is that the right word?” Or sometimes, “Is that a word?”
I always nodded in approval, until the day in November when he tried to use “immersement.” No. Not a word.
The weirdest part of my career, then, is the nine years I spent as The Tribune's sports editor. That experience ultimately helped me in many ways, yet the job description meant that I was in the office on many nights when cool stuff was happening elsewhere. While I covered some unforgettable Jazz playoff games, none of them involved Michael Jordan. I attended seven Olympics, but Salt Lake City's Winter Games were not included.
I also missed Utah's trip to the NCAA Final Four in San Antonio. So even though Ute fans would rather not remember what happened against Texas, I liked being in the Alamodome for my last event.
I'm realizing why these farewell columns always include a disclaimer about having too many people to thank. I'll mention one person. My first Jazz trip as the Deseret News' beat writer was to San Antonio in 1985, when I was 24 years old and feeling overwhelmed by the assignment. Jerry Sloan, then an assistant coach, offered this advice: Just take it a week at a time.
That suggestion has stuck with me during the demanding weeks of the Olympics, the too-short weeks of the Masters and everything else I've done.
Even some events of the last two or three years seem to me like they happened long ago. So I won't say these 42 years and eight months since that soccer game have flown by, as most columns like this conclude. But I've loved the nature of newspaper work. Being part of a daily product meant there always was the hope of doing it better the next day.
That’s what I’ll miss, besides Whittingham’s word checks.

Texto completo: It’s hard to get a one-on-one with a U.S. senator but, if our paths happened to cross — say, at Hires Big H — here’s what I’d say to Mitt Romney over a burger and fries.
You and I could not be more different, yet we are on the same page when it comes to the character of the president and the havoc he is wreaking on the American soul.
We were, I learned recently, born three weeks apart. We grew up in the same era, absorbing the same American spirit. We both became lawyers. You became a political conservative, while I leaned progressive. When you salvaged the troubled 2002 Olympics, I worked in a secured building downtown, monitoring security for the games. I was among your biggest fans.
Later, when you served as governor of Massachusetts, I marveled that a conservative won this historically liberal state, my birthplace.
Now, decades later, you’re my senator. I appreciate that you distinguish your support for many of the president’s policies from your concerns about his character. We agree that his words, conduct, relationships and values profoundly harm the American spirit. The man’s character and his presidency are inextricably connected, to the nation’s detriment.
Most others in your party who agree have become “homeless Republicans.” The party no longer welcomes people of good will who believe in conservative values but cannot condone the president’s relentless attacks on people and on democratic institutions and norms.
And now we’re at a crossroads. The president’s trial for abuse of power and obstruction of justice looms before the U.S. Senate. How do we isolate this trial from the ongoing media circus? How do we maintain the integrity of the constitutional impeachment clause?
The answer, I think, is to return to first principles. Alexander Hamilton enshrined the crucial role of the senate in the Federalist Papers: “What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers?”
You maintain you can do this. “I will act as a juror and will be unbiased in evaluating the cases that are presented,” you told The Tribune.
Kudos to you. What a dramatic departure from Sens. Mitch McConnell and Lindsay Graham, who make no pretense of dispensing the “impartial justice” mandated by the impeachment oath.
In 2020, for a senator to remain open-minded, unbiased and committed only to actual facts is a tall order. But a fair trial is pivotal to public acceptance of the verdict, whatever it may be. To stay true to our Constitution and reclaim an ethical America, the Senate trial must lay bare the full story. If we simply devolve into tribal allegiances protecting or condemning the president, we’ve eroded our democracy.
Four days after the House impeachment vote, The Center for Public Integrity received a trove of governmental documents exploring the legality of the president’s order to withhold congressionally authorized aid to Ukraine. Multiple staffers had first-hand knowledge of the president’s intent. Eight days later, The New York Times detailed exactly what happened in the White House during this time.
We need to hear from these people closest to the president. If the House failed to get their testimony, create a Senate rule to rectify the error. Two wrongs do not make a right. Four senators plus the minority party could adopt this rule.
Sen. Romney, I am not asking you to remove the president from office.
I am asking you to take two actions before the impeachment trial. First, vote for trial rules that ensure all relevant facts come before the senate and the American people. Then, examine the evidence — and vote your conscience.
Second, other senators have expressed reservations about the president’s character. Work with them to adopt these rules. You’ve committed to speaking out against “statements or actions that are ... dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions.” Inspire your colleagues to join you in courageously standing up for our country’s foundational values.
You’ve nothing to lose by supporting an impeachment trial structured to learn the truth. The president has already attacked you, demeaning and belittling you for your candor. If you want another Senate term, the people of Utah will re-elect you.
Sen. Romney, we know the kind of nation we want to leave for the generations to come. You are a free man. Do the right thing.

Texto completo: The reviews of the 1619 Project are in.
It is “a very unbalanced, one-sided account.” It is “wrong in so many ways.” It is “not only ahistorical,” but “actually anti-historical.” It is “a tendentious and partial reading of American history.”
<img class="size-medium wp-image-2599038" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/Rich-Lowry-Color-300x293.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="293" />
This is what top historians have said of the splashy New York Times feature on slavery in the U.S. that aspires to fundamentally reorient our understanding of American history and change what students are taught in the schools.
Given that the Times can’t necessarily be trusted to give a straight account in its news pages of Mitch McConnell’s latest tactical maneuver, it wouldn’t seem a natural source for objective truth on sensitive historical matters, and sure enough, the 1619 Project is shot through with an ideological radicalism that leads to rank distortions and laughable overreach.
The project has been controversial since it was first published in The New York Times Magazine last year, but its architects sneered at the critics as troglodyte conservatives (or “white historians”) unwilling to grapple with the country’s racial sins. Then the World Socialist Web Site — of all things — begin publishing interviews with eminent historians slamming the project.
All of the above quotations come from the website’s interviews with highly accomplished and respected historians — the Princeton professor James McPherson, author of the magisterial history of the Civil War, “Battle Cry of Freedom”; the formidable historian of the Revolutionary War period, Gordon Wood; the CUNY professor James Oakes, who specializes in the Civil War period; and the Lincoln scholar Richard Carwardine of Oxford University.
At the end of the year, the Times published an extraordinary letter from McPherson, Oakes and Wood, as well as Sean Wilentz of Princeton and Victoria Bynum of Texas State University, demanding “prominent corrections of all the errors and distortions presented in the 1619 Project.”
“These errors, which concern major events, cannot be described as interpretation or ‘framing,'” the historians wrote. “They are matters of verifiable fact, which are the foundation of both honest scholarship and honest journalism. They suggest a displacement of historical understanding by ideology. Dismissal of objections on racial grounds — that they are the objections of only ‘white historians’ — has affirmed that displacement.”
The Times, in a response from the editor in chief of the magazine, Jake Silverstein, countered, “Historical understanding is not fixed; it is constantly being adjusted by new scholarship and new voices.” In other words, just wait and the supporters of the 1619 Project will enshrine it as a new orthodoxy.
One focus of the historians is the preposterous claim of the 1619 Project that a primary reason that the colonists launched the American Revolution was to protect slavery. “This is not true,” they say. “If supportable, the allegation would be astounding — yet every statement offered by the project to validate it is false.”
Silverstein counters by invoking disquiet among American slaveholders over the landmark Somerset decision in England in 1772 that found that chattel slavery wasn’t supported under the “natural law.” Yet nothing in the historical record suggests that the decision, which didn’t apply to the colonies, played a role in precipitating the revolution. Silverstein also notes the so-called Dunmore’s Proclamation by the royal governor of Virginia in late 1775 offering freedom to slaves who joined with British forces. By this point, though, the revolution was already underway (the First Continental Congress met in 1774; Lexington and Concord came earlier in 1775).
Nothing is going to budge the Times from its view that slavery is the central story of America, because establishing that is the entire point of the 1619 Project. Nonetheless, the dissenting historians are performing an important public service. They are making the dishonesty of the project a matter of record, and might, in so doing, cause educational institutions to think twice before adopting it wholesale into their curricula.
At least the Times’ assault on the nation’s historical memory is not going unanswered.

Texto completo: La muerte del general Qasem Soleimani, comandante de las Guardias Revolucionarias de Irán y uno de los hombres más poderosos de ese país, sin duda incrementará las tensiones que ya existían entre Washington y Teherán.
Irán ya prometió “una venganza severa” en respuesta al ataque aéreo de Estados Unidos que provocó la muerte del militar cuando viajaba en un auto en el aeropuerto de la capital iraquí, Bagdad. Junto al general iraní también murió Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, líder de las Fuerzas de Movilización Popular.
Soleimani era una importante figura militar y política, no sólo en su país sino en toda la región de Medio Oriente donde mantenía estrechos vínculos con grupos paramilitares y milicias chiitas.
* Quién era Qasem Soleimani, el poderoso y temido jefe de la fuerza Quds de Irán muerto en un ataque de Estados Unidos
* EE.UU. mata en Irak al poderoso general iraní Qasem Soleimani, líder de la fuerza élite Quds
Los expertos afirman que las consecuencias de su muerte serán considerables y algunas se sintieron de inmediato tras el ataque de este viernes.
La muerte de Qasem Soleimani tuvo lugar después de que, a pesar de las tensiones, todas las partes en la región aseguraran que querían evitar una guerra.
En meses pasados, una serie de ataques con cohetes de Irán dirigidos a la presencia militar de Estados Unidos en Irak fueron recibidos por Washington como una molestia, más que una amenaza.
Pero después de un ataque el domingo pasado en el que murió un contratista estadounidense en una base militar cerca de Kirkuk, Irak, Trump ordenó cinco ataques aéreos contra los aliados militares iraquíes de Irán.
Los iraquíes a su vez respondieron con el asedio la embajada estadounidense en Bagdad, y se cree que este hecho provocó el ataque contra Soleimani.
* Miles de manifestantes atacan la embajada de Estados Unidos en Bagdad
La pregunta que muchos se plantean ahora es ¿está Irán preparado para enfrentar una guerra contra Estados Unidos y sus aliados en la región?
Tal como apunta David Garner, editor de asuntos internacionales del diario The Financial Times, “Irán y sus apoderados en la región han absorbido varios ataques aéreos contra sus combatientes y sus bienes: llevados a cabo por Israel en Siria, por Estados Unidos en Irak o Arabia Saudita en Yemen”.
EPAEl ayatolá Ali Khamenei, emitió una declaración llamando a tres días de duelo público y posteriormente represalias.
Irán, por su parte, llevó a cabo el año pasado una serie de ataques contra barcos petroleros en el Golfo y el asalto con drones y misiles contra instalaciones petroleras de Arabia Saudita en septiembre, el cual temporalmente eliminó la mitad de la producción del reino.
“Esto fue una demostración deliberada de las capacidades iraníes. Los sauditas no respondieron a ella y tampoco respondió la Casa Blanca de Trump, para el horror extendido de sus aliados regionales”, dice Garner.
“La operación de Estados Unidos en el aeropuerto de Bagdad, sin embargo, que liquidó a un comandante que el régimen iraní había convertido en una leyenda popular y estaba preparando para el más alto cargo en el país, es algo a lo que casi ciertamente responderá la república islámica con furia de armas de cañón múltiple “.
* Por qué EE.UU. mató a Soleimani ahora (y qué es lo que se espera que ocurra)
* Qué es y cómo opera la temida Fuerza Quds, el grupo de élite iraní que comandaba Qasem Soleimani
Por su parte Lyse Dooucet, de la BBC, afirma que la muerte del general Soleimani “intensificará lo que ya es una situación extremadamente tensa y volátil” en una región ya marcada por las guerras y la convulsión política.
“Los funcionarios iraníes son categóricos: este es un acto de guerra que debe ser respondido con una ‘dura represalia’ . Irán tiene muchas formas y medios de contraatacar a medida que esta crisis de larga ebullición súbitamente se convierte en un nuevo y peligroso capítulo”.
Getty ImagesLa muerte de Soleimani provocará represalias significativas por parte de Irán, según analistas.
“Se espera una represalia significativa por parte de Irán, y esto podría conducir a un ciclo de acción y reacción que podría acercar a EE.UU. e Irán a un total conflicto “, según el corresponsal de Defensa y Asuntos Diplomáticos de la BBC, Jonathan Marcus.
En declaraciones al diario The New York Times, Robert Malley, director de International Crisis Group y quien trabajó en el gobierno de Barack Obama como coordinador para Medio Oriente y África del Norte, aseguro que “sea que el presidente Trump tuviera esa intención no, (lo ocurrido) es para todos los propósitos prácticos una declaración de guerra”.
Pese a esta declaración, Marcus cree que es importante “no exagerar ni tampoco subestimar” la importancia del momento.
“ Esto no provocará una Tercera Guerra Mundial. Países clave que podrían estar involucrados en tal guerra, como Rusia y China, no son actores importantes en este conflicto (…). Pero esto podría ser un momento decisivo para Oriente Medio y para el papel que juega Washington en él”, asegura.

Pese a esta declaración, Marcus cree que es importante “no exagerar ni tampoco subestimar” la importancia del momento.
“ Esto no provocará una Tercera Guerra Mundial. Países clave que podrían estar involucrados en tal guerra, como Rusia y China, no son actores importantes en este conflicto (…). Pero esto podría ser un momento decisivo para Oriente Medio y para el papel que juega Washington en él”, asegura.

Texto completo: Are you getting enough football? As you know, these days there is only one thing to say after a full day of binge-watching football games:
May I have another bowl please?
You may. Take your pick. There are 39 college bowl games this year and I hope everyone got the memo about the Frisco Bowl. It’s in Frisco, Texas, not San Francisco.
And of course, all these overflowing bowls are just the opening act of the NFL tilt-a-whirl. Beginning now, the playoff games are a three-weekend leadup to what our Founding Fathers so astutely decreed a national holiday — Super Bowl Sunday.
Quick question. Isn’t that a lot of football? Surely there is a saturation point somewhere. Isn’t this close?
Actually, no. By the numbers, football is an All-American hit. Sunday Night Football, just to throw out a stat, has been the No. 1 prime-time network show for nine straight years. No other show has been close to that. Ever.
And if you’re wondering, last Sunday night’s game between the 49ers and Seattle had 23.3 million viewers. That’s about three-million more than average. Hello rematch.
The NFL consistently draws huge, profitable numbers. According to John Ourand of Sports Business Daily, “60% of the 100 most-watched shows are NFL games.”
But the colleges, you say. Isn’t that a niche market in the south, like stock car racing?
Nope. The National Football Foundation has numbers that say the 366 televised regular-season games averaged 1.8 million viewers and were seen by “163 million unique fans.”
So football is thriving. If anything, the curve is up. This is the second year in a row that NFL ratings have risen, following disastrous dips in 2016 and 2017.
Front-office types now blame the two-year downturn on the kneeling protests led by Colin Kaepernick and the subsequent hysteria. Little-noticed in all of this is that the networks solved their problem by quietly not televising the national anthem. It kept them out of the mud bath, and, incidentally, gave them another 1:30 to sell ads.
Which is the kind of cold-blooded math that gives you pause about football. Sure, this is about teams. But the teams are made up of players. With partners, wives, kids and family watching their guy on every play, hoping he gets up.
We always say how huge NFL players are, and some are, but I’m always struck by how small some are. Granted, they’re ripped and can probably do one-handed chin-ups, but 180 pounds is not that big.
The New York Times had a stat that said: including the preseason, the odds that any given NFL player would get a concussion is one out of 10. Would you get in a cab that promised you a one-out-of-10 chance of an accident?
I can’t decide if the players are fearless or desperate, but the way they throw their bodies around is beyond reckless.
Of course, the league is going to tell us that concussions are down and there is nothing more important than player safety — right after they announce a 17-game season. Just to be clear, that’s a full game more for the same pay? Spare the compassion.
But the real evidence of concern for football is in the participation at lower levels. It’s trending down.
And you are not hearing from the rough, tough former players yelling about getting out there and hitting somebody. Chris Borland, you may recall, played a single terrific season at linebacker for the 49ers and retired, citing concern for his health.
And it was just in August when Andrew Luck left everyone stunned when he abruptly retired. He wasn’t going to put his body through this anymore.
That was an important story. For Luck, a star quarterback, to leave, says a lot about the game.
Borland and others are pushing flag football as an alternative to tackle, at least until high school. Saints quarterback Drew Brees coaches his sons’ flag football team.
Best of luck.
And by the way, for a game that consistently talks about expanding into other countries, there hasn’t been much of that, has there? Every other sport, it seems, has international connections.
There’s hardly an NBA roster without at least two international players. The PGA golf tour may be elitist, but if you can play, you can play. Major League Baseball has been multicultural for so long it isn’t even noticed. It is probably a great place to learn Spanish.
But football has stayed stubbornly, militantly America’s game. Somebody is always showing up with a British shot putter who can jump over the water cooler, but they never seem to last.
So, basically, what you see is what you’re going to get. It is a violent, engaging, and strategic game. People will get hurt on a regular basis. We will be sad but likely forget about them before long.
Meanwhile, the pile of cash continues to grow. CBS, FOX and NBC are currently paying roughly a $1 billion a year for the NFL. Ourand said the new deal, which may be done by the Super Bowl, could be “60-70%” higher.
It’s a lot to consider. But those are all problems for the future. This is the annual Football Vortex. Resistance is futile.
Please remain seated for the duration.

Texto completo: La muerte del general Qasem Soleimani, comandante de las Guardias Revolucionarias de Irán y uno de los hombres más poderosos de ese país, sin duda incrementará las tensiones que ya existían entre Washington y Teherán.
Irán ya prometió “una venganza severa” en respuesta al ataque aéreo de Estados Unidos que provocó la muerte del militar cuando viajaba en un auto en el aeropuerto de la capital iraquí, Bagdad. Junto al general iraní también murió Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, líder de las Fuerzas de Movilización Popular.
Soleimani era una importante figura militar y política, no sólo en su país sino en toda la región de Medio Oriente donde mantenía estrechos vínculos con grupos paramilitares y milicias chiitas.
* Quién era Qasem Soleimani, el poderoso y temido jefe de la fuerza Quds de Irán muerto en un ataque de Estados Unidos
* EE.UU. mata en Irak al poderoso general iraní Qasem Soleimani, líder de la fuerza élite Quds
Los expertos afirman que las consecuencias de su muerte serán considerables y algunas se sintieron de inmediato tras el ataque de este viernes.
La muerte de Qasem Soleimani tuvo lugar después de que, a pesar de las tensiones, todas las partes en la región aseguraran que querían evitar una guerra.
En meses pasados, una serie de ataques con cohetes de Irán dirigidos a la presencia militar de Estados Unidos en Irak fueron recibidos por Washington como una molestia, más que una amenaza.
Pero después de un ataque el domingo pasado en el que murió un contratista estadounidense en una base militar cerca de Kirkuk, Irak, Trump ordenó cinco ataques aéreos contra los aliados militares iraquíes de Irán.
Los iraquíes a su vez respondieron con el asedio la embajada estadounidense en Bagdad, y se cree que este hecho provocó el ataque contra Soleimani.
* Miles de manifestantes atacan la embajada de Estados Unidos en Bagdad
La pregunta que muchos se plantean ahora es ¿está Irán preparado para enfrentar una guerra contra Estados Unidos y sus aliados en la región?
Tal como apunta David Garner, editor de asuntos internacionales del diario The Financial Times, “Irán y sus apoderados en la región han absorbido varios ataques aéreos contra sus combatientes y sus bienes: llevados a cabo por Israel en Siria, por Estados Unidos en Irak o Arabia Saudita en Yemen”.
EPAEl ayatolá Ali Khamenei, emitió una declaración llamando a tres días de duelo público y posteriormente represalias.
Irán, por su parte, llevó a cabo el año pasado una serie de ataques contra barcos petroleros en el Golfo y el asalto con drones y misiles contra instalaciones petroleras de Arabia Saudita en septiembre, el cual temporalmente eliminó la mitad de la producción del reino.
“Esto fue una demostración deliberada de las capacidades iraníes. Los sauditas no respondieron a ella y tampoco respondió la Casa Blanca de Trump, para el horror extendido de sus aliados regionales”, dice Garner.
“La operación de Estados Unidos en el aeropuerto de Bagdad, sin embargo, que liquidó a un comandante que el régimen iraní había convertido en una leyenda popular y estaba preparando para el más alto cargo en el país, es algo a lo que casi ciertamente responderá la república islámica con furia de armas de cañón múltiple “.
* Por qué EE.UU. mató a Soleimani ahora (y qué es lo que se espera que ocurra)
* Qué es y cómo opera la temida Fuerza Quds, el grupo de élite iraní que comandaba Qasem Soleimani
Por su parte Lyse Dooucet, de la BBC, afirma que la muerte del general Soleimani “intensificará lo que ya es una situación extremadamente tensa y volátil” en una región ya marcada por las guerras y la convulsión política.
“Los funcionarios iraníes son categóricos: este es un acto de guerra que debe ser respondido con una ‘dura represalia’ . Irán tiene muchas formas y medios de contraatacar a medida que esta crisis de larga ebullición súbitamente se convierte en un nuevo y peligroso capítulo”.
Getty ImagesLa muerte de Soleimani provocará represalias significativas por parte de Irán, según analistas.
“Se espera una represalia significativa por parte de Irán, y esto podría conducir a un ciclo de acción y reacción que podría acercar a EE.UU. e Irán a un total conflicto “, según el corresponsal de Defensa y Asuntos Diplomáticos de la BBC, Jonathan Marcus.
En declaraciones al diario The New York Times, Robert Malley, director de International Crisis Group y quien trabajó en el gobierno de Barack Obama como coordinador para Medio Oriente y África del Norte, aseguro que “sea que el presidente Trump tuviera esa intención no, (lo ocurrido) es para todos los propósitos prácticos una declaración de guerra”.

Texto completo: In a Friday Twitter post, Vice President Mike Pence claimed top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani assisted the 9/11 hijackers in traveling to Afghanistan.
In a thread laying out Soleimani's "worst atrocities," Pence included how Soleimani "assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States. "
Links between Soleimani and the 9/11 attacks have not been proven, as experts noted.
Daniel Byman, a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution and a staff member on the 9/11 Commission, told USA TODAY, "To my knowledge, there's no evidence Soleimani was directly running the 9/11 operatives that were transiting Iran. "
Although there were links between Al Qaeda and Iran, it was "not true" that Iran was behind the 9/11 attacks, Byman said.
As the bipartisan report from the 9/11 Commission concluded, "We have found no evidence that Iran or Hezbollah was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack. "
The tweet drew condemnation from experts, journalists and former government officials, who pushed back on the statement.

More: Iran ambassador to UN on Soleimani killing: 'the response for a military action is military action'
Pence's critics were also quick to note how there were 19 hijackers who carried out the 9/11 attacks, not 12.
Pence's press secretary Katie Waldman stood by the assertion, saying "12 of the 19 transited through Afghanistan. 10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani. "
Soleimani, The New York Times reported, was not mentioned in the 9/11 Commission's report.
Soleimani was killed in an airstrike on his convoy ordered by President Donald Trump on Thursday. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the attack had been ordered to avert an "imminent threat. " About 3,000 more soldiers are to be deployed to Kuwait to reinforce existing forces.
Iran has threatened "harsh retaliation" and "military action" against those responsible for Soleimani's killing.

Divided by LGBT issues, United Methodists announce plan to split A rift that won't heal

Texto completo: The United Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination, is poised to formally split after years of infighting over LGBT inclusivity.
A 16-member committee of bishops and other church leaders announced Friday they had agreed to spin off a "traditionalist Methodist" denomination that would uphold bans on same-sex marriage and the ordination of LGBT clergy.
The plan was hammered out during three two-day mediation sessions at law offices in Washington, D.C., the New York Times reported. But it won't take effect unless it is approved during the church's general conference in May in Minneapolis.
"I think it's important to remember that this is not the final decision," said the Rev. Heather Seman, who leads the Community United Methodist Church in Coeur d'Alene, which embraces LGBT people.
"We have a sign outside that says, 'All are welcome. All means all.' And that's serious. We mean it," Seman said.
She's been a pastor at the church for 14 years. Sunday services, she said, draw about 150 people.
While it's often discussed in private, she said, the topic of LGBT inclusivity has been a constant source of anxiety among churchgoers.
"We're hurting people who are part of the LGBTQIA community, and we're also hurting people who have been United Methodists their whole lives," Seman said. "We have a lot of people who we love, who are really caught up in the middle of this."
The panel that approved the separation plan included church leaders from the United States, the Philippines, Europe and Africa, where churches tend to be conservative and same-sex marriage remains illegal on most of the continent.
In the United States, "we have the opportunity to look at it in a way that we couldn't if it were illegal," Seman said.
The Rev. Gregg Sealey is the superintendent for a United Methodist Church district that spans from Eastern Washington to the Montana border, overseeing pastors at 45 churches. He's one of five superintendents in a Pacific Northwest conference that participates in church affairs at the national level.
Sealey said the churches he oversees represent a wide array of opinions, and he noted that members of the same congregation don't agree with each other on every issue, including LGBT rights.
"In my experience, all these congregations - even the ones that have diversity of opinion - they have somehow figured out a way to love each other and to be in church together, even if they disagree," Sealey said.
"My focus is trying to hold local congregations together with that spirit of unity, and figuring out a way to live out our faith and to serve our neighbors, no matter what happens," he said.
Yet the schism in the United Methodist Church is undeniable.
During a special off-year general conference in February, 53% of church leaders and lay members voted to tighten restrictions on same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy, declaring homosexuality "incompatible with Christian teaching."
"In reflection, after the last general conference, I think it's pretty widely recognized that there will have to be some form of separation - hopefully an amicable separation, but some form of separation," Sealey said.
'Our faith rests in God'
The Rev. Mark Haberman, an ordained deacon at Seman's church in Coeur d'Alene, stands to be personally affected by the division over LGBT inclusivity. He's belonged to the United Methodist Church for all but six years of his life.
"I was born into the cradle of Methodism," the 63-year-old said.
His father was a longtime clergyman, as were his uncle and aunt - one of the first women to serve in Methodist ministry.
"So if there's anything that's a part of my family DNA - who I am - it would be the United Methodist Church," Haberman said.
But when Haberman was in his late 30s, his marriage with his wife ended. By 2000, some in the church knew he was gay.
"I was kind of partially in and partially out, and the pressure was on  and it was really going to be impossible for me to stay there in that employment," Haberman said.
After seven years with the Coeur d'Alene congregation, he left and began working for a social services agency, Aging and Long Term Care of Eastern Washington in Spokane.
He did not return to the church until 2006, when he was asked to help find a permanent music director.
Two years later, he was prepared to leave again, unwilling to keep his partner - now his husband - a secret from other churchgoers. But Seman, the pastor, led a process to gain the congregation's support to keep him around.
"The congregation said, 'Mark, we know you. We have known you for almost 10 years. We may not all be of like mind, but you don't have to leave over this.' And they allowed me to withdraw my resignation," Haberman recalled.
In June 2018, he was reinstated as a United Methodist deacon.
"I was in good standing," he said. "And I went through a process of doing some writing, some reflecting, two different levels of interviews, three levels of votes, and my clergy orders were restored."
Under the stricter restrictions adopted last year, however, Haberman's status as a gay clergyman leaves him open to punishment from higher-ups in the church.
He speaks about it anyway.
"Ultimately, our faith does not rest in a denomination," he said. "Our faith rests in God."

Texto completo: A former principal of two Wisconsin high schools tried for months to meet a person he thought was a 14-year-old boy for sex and booked a "whirlpool suite" at a Neenah hotel before police arrested him this week, new court documents show.
David Hay, 39, of Brooklyn, New York, started using the dating app Grindr in July to correspond with someone he thought was a 14-year-old boy from Neenah, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Wisconsin announced Friday.
"Hay began engaging in sexually explicit conversations ... and making plans to meet up with the minor to engage in sexual activity," according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
But the "teen" was actually a Neenah police investigator.
Hay, who grew up in Antigo, served as principal at Tomah High School from 2011 to 2014 and at Kettle Moraine High School before that. He most recently served as deputy chief of staff to the chancellor of New York City public schools but was fired after his arrest, according to the New York Times.
The investigator was using an undercover account on the dating app Grindr on July 3, when he got a message from Hay, according to a criminal complaint prosecutors filed Thursday in federal court.
When the investigator revealed the "teen" was 14 years old, Hay replied, "Yea I'm good w that," the complaint says. Hay eventually sent his phone number and tried to arrange a time to meet but later said he wouldn't be able to meet that night.
The investigator matched Hay's phone number to his identity and used state Department of Transportation records to match Hay's photo with photos used on his Grindr profile, the complaint says.
In late August, Hay again tried to arrange to meet but didn't want to pay $600 for a flight to Appleton, the complaint says. On Dec. 9, Hay sent a message about returning to Wisconsin at the end of the month.
On Dec. 26, Hay sent what appeared to be a hotel reservation for Dec. 28 and talked more about meeting for sex, the complaint says. The "teen" asked Hay to pick him up away from his parents' house, and Hay agreed.
The investigator checked with the hotel and found a reservation under Hay's name, but Hay later sent a message saying he wouldn't be able to meet because of a family emergency, the complaint says.
Neenah police said they arrested Hay on Sunday at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee. A search of his phone revealed sexually explicit images of a former Tomah High School student, according to the complaint.
Hay faces federal charges of child enticement and child pornography possession. If convicted of child enticement, Hay would face a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and could get a life sentence. He could also face up to 10 years in prison for the child pornography charge, if convicted.

The view of California from 2030 is pretty good

Texto completo: January 1, 2030
To my three sons:
I'm so proud of you. I especially appreciate, now that you're 21, 18, and 16, you no longer fight with each other like you did when you were little. You're all doing well in school and have bright futures ahead.
But don't forget how lucky you've been to come of age in California during this -concluding decade, the Roaring 2020s. Our state is doing so well that it's hard to remember how fraught things seemed 10 years ago.
Back then, California faced a dire housing shortage and had one of the nation's highest poverty rates. Digital technology was causing massive disruption. Mega-fires were destroying homes and killing people. And the federal government was undermining our desperate efforts to reckon with these problems.
"It's the End of California As We Know It," declared a New York Times column in 2019.
Worse still, neither governments nor businesses had the tools to deal with problems that seemed too big and overwhelming. Amidst these feelings of hopelessness we fell even deeper into a bad habit. We started declaring that we would solve certain problems by a set year — without having real plans to do it.
As a target year, 2030 came up again and again. State politicians talked constantly about the need to reduce emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. But those goals weren't accompanied by realistic plans to achieve the requisite remissions reductions — especially in the face of increasing emissions from transportation and wildfires.
2030 fantasies went much further than climate, though. In 2018, the state Department of Education declared a goal under "Global California 2030" of making half of all K-12 students proficient in two or more languages. But no one provided the funding for the immersion programs and foreign language teachers necessary to make it happen.
In retrospect, too many of our 2030 goals were too small and underfunded — like the state's plans to build up long-term care and other services for seniors when the population of people over 65 doubled between 2015 and 2030. Or the University of California's underwhelming "UC 2030," which outlined the modest goal of increasing graduation rates a few points.
You may not remember the two early 2020s calamities that shook California out of its stupor.
First, the 2019 housing crisis got worse. The state kept making new demands, but local governments, kept opposing new construction. In January 2021, thousands of homeless Californians stormed the Capitol, kicked out all the legislators — and made the building their home for the next year.
At the same time, a nasty national recession hit, sparked a federal debt default. In a 2021 poll, half of Californians feared they could become homeless.
That drove the Golden State to radical action.
During 2008's Great Recession, California had considered replacing its old Constitution, which made governing in crisis impossible, with a new system. But elites instead decided to make budget cuts and suffer through the pain of unemployment and foreclosures. But by 2021 it was clear that the governing system needed to change to give people and leaders the agency to deal with our problems.
Looking back, the biggest driver of California change wasn't self-driving cars or cheaper space rockets but the new Constitution, drafted in early 2022 and approved by voters later that year. Crucially, this Constitution took powers away from state government, thus creating more freedom for regions and local communities to govern themselves.
The effect was startling, rapid, and deep. The state's regions were able to accelerate housing, remake transportation systems, take back control of crucial utilities, and ramp up economic development on their own. In one constitutional moment, so many pent-up ambitions were unleashed that the entire state seemed to roar with new innovation.
In retrospect, we should have been able to see more of the potential within ourselves. Back in 2019, I traveled the state as a columnist and often marveled that, for all the state's structural problems, our local communities still made progress, from the innovative development of West Sacramento to the fiscal reforms of Glendale. Even in the despair of 2020, Fresno was remaking itself into our next great city, and L.A. was so boldly rebuilding its transit system that city governments in Boston and New York took notice.
Now, if I had written a letter like this to you in January 2020, it would have been dismissed as a fairy tale. People's moods were just too dark back then.
But, looking back, the biggest lesson is clear: deep within our hearts, Californians carry possibilities so grand that the future may happily surprise us.
Love, Dad

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence agencies face a significant reduction in their counterterrorism collection efforts in Africa if a proposed withdrawal of U.S. military forces is carried out by the Pentagon, intelligence officials said.
The new planning to pull back intelligence officers deployed in Western Africa and other parts of the continent has been partly driven by the troop deployment review, which is expected to reduce U.S. forces in Niger, Nigeria and other countries in the region.
The presence of U.S. troops allows intelligence officers to travel far from traditional diplomatic outposts. The troops also provide protection in the event of spreading chaos or instability. Stark evidence of the risk was seen in the lethal 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and increased security was ordered for those outposts.
If service members are soon pulled out of Africa, the CIA and other intelligence agencies simply would not be able to safely deploy their officers far beyond embassy walls, officials say.
One intelligence official called the potential shift of CIA officers out of Africa stunningly dangerous. The decision would not just hurt the United States' ability to detect and stop terrorism threats, the official said, but also hinder its ability to collect intelligence about what rival nations, like Russia and China, are doing in Africa.
While it is difficult to assess how much of an intelligence deficit would follow a troop pullback, the loss would be real, said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center.
"With a smaller military and intelligence presence, we limit how much intelligence we collect. Our analysts have a less rich pool of information on which to draw when reaching conclusions and forecasting threat conditions," said Rasmussen, the acting executive director of Arizona State University's McCain Institute. "Our confidence levels in the analysis we produce end up being lower."
Trump administration officials would not say how many intelligence officers could be affected by the changes because the number of officers in the field is a closely guarded secret.
The pullback of intelligence officers is not driven only by the planned troop reductions. Counterterrorism officials are also being asked to rethink their work and narrow their focus to the most dangerous terrorist groups, according to current and former intelligence officials.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, the United States shifted resources to fighting terrorism. While most of those were focused on groups like al-Qaida and then the Islamic State, both with the reach to orchestrate or inspire attacks on the United States homeland, U.S. military and intelligence agencies also built up resources against regional terrorism threats.
The Trump administration, hoping to prevent the United States from becoming entangled in more long wars, wants the military and intelligence forces to scale down their ambitions. Under the plans now being discussed, fewer resources would be allocated to monitoring regional threats - terrorist groups that might spout anti-American speech but do not have the wherewithal to mount a significant attack on U.S. territory.
Rasmussen said no terrorist organization in Africa so far had successfully been able to attack the American homeland, giving credence to the idea that too much emphasis had been put on such groups. But without military and intelligence personnel on the ground, working with partner nations to help combat regional terrorist organizations, it becomes difficult to assess which groups have or could have the capabilities to mount an attack on the United States, Rasmussen said.
The shift, military and intelligence officials said, is also part of an effort to move resources toward countering the rise of China and to more adroitly compete with Beijing.
But some U.S. officials believe that cutting back the intelligence and military presence will reduce the United States' clout in Africa at the very time it is becoming a front line in the influence battle with Russia and China.
The three nations are jostling for prominence in sub-Saharan Africa. Russia's mercenary force, the Wagner Group, has had a presence in the Central African Republic and other countries, said Sean McFate, a professor at the National Defense University and the author of "The New Rules of War." China has a military support base in Djibouti and is using its Belt and Road Initiative to expand its connections throughout the continent.
McFate said that as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq wind down, there is a weariness with counterinsurgency operations. But pulling troops and intelligence officers out of Africa as a reaction to the exhaustion with "forever wars" is a strategic error, he said.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - U.S. intelligence agencies face a significant reduction in their counterterrorism collection efforts in Africa if a proposed withdrawal of U.S. military forces is carried out by the Pentagon, intelligence officials said.
The new planning to pull back intelligence officers deployed in Western Africa and other parts of the continent has been partly driven by the troop deployment review, which is expected to reduce U.S. forces in Niger, Nigeria and other countries in the region.
The presence of U.S. troops allows intelligence officers to travel far from traditional diplomatic outposts. The troops also provide protection in the event of spreading chaos or instability. Stark evidence of the risk was seen in the lethal 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and increased security was ordered for those outposts.
If service members are soon pulled out of Africa, the CIA and other intelligence agencies simply would not be able to safely deploy their officers far beyond embassy walls, officials say.

Could there be a new religion in the neighborhood?

Texto completo: New religions have been sprouting up for millennia. It seems there is always room in the garden for another plant in the pantheon (plant-theon?) of beliefs. Often the new isn't so new. A "new" faith is simply an offshoot, a branch, split off from an "old" faith. Someone decides not to hand over or pass along the seeds, screeds or creeds from the past ("tradition" – to give across); they choose another way ("heresy" – to choose a contrary opinion) and a new faith blossoms on a fresh patch of soil.
Yet, the old earth isn't always fertile for faith. Some religions that we used to study as "World" Religions – major faiths with large followings – really aren't so much any longer. How many Zoroastrian, Jain, Shinto or Shaker devotees do you know? There remain pockets here and there, but their numbers have shriveled on the vine of the divine.
Also to be considered in the compost are the "dead" religions of the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Norse. Who worships the Olympian gods anymore? I wrote this on Woden's-Day, or was it Thor's-Day? Gods gone but not forgotten.
Hinduism presents a lively challenge since it is one great religion composed of many smaller faiths with countless gods and goddesses. It's one big sacred tent, we could say. Christianism has similarities with hundreds of denominations, sects and splinter groups, all claiming to be God's special splinter. More a tattered tent perhaps.
"Syncretism" is a helpful word we learned in comparative religious studies. A merging or blending of traditions. The dictionary defines the verb "syncretize" as the "attempt to amalgamate or reconcile (differing things, especially religious beliefs, cultural elements, or schools of thought)." We might think of the confluence of rivers or maybe the flow of blood through the veins. It would be fair to say that Islam is syncretistic with elements of Judaism, Christianism and Arabian tribal beliefs. Add to these hybrid heresies and blended beliefs the charismatic personalities of their prophets and we have a recipe for something to call a "Religion."
All this leads me to wonder when the next religion will pop up. Will a new religion arise to "throw shade" and supersede all the rest? Maybe it's already arrived and thrives right before our eyes.
Could there be an alternative faith beyond all other faiths, something that doesn't even need to call itself a faith?
Have you listened to the podcast, "Finding Fred"? Yes, Fred Rogers of "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood." For those of us who remember watching the PBS program or those who have seen the current films on the man, there is a certain emotion that stirs just seeing his picture or hearing his voice. The podcast, hosted by Carvell Wallace, an African-American author and contributor to the New York Times Magazine, highlights some fascinating facets to the uncommon man and his unforgettable message.
I was impressed that Rogers was a minister who didn't feel the need to talk about his faith or God with children or parents. His "neighborhood" somehow seemed more real, more honest and frankly more loving than many other neighborhoods of traditional beliefs.
"I like you just the way you are" he would say. Quite a worldview or "religion." A spirituality that sings beyond spiritualities. His ministry – and he did see his program as a ministry – was to encourage families and children to love others and love themselves. As the podcast stated, he was "very affirming of all people ... he found the good in all faith traditions" and he was "very sensitive toward people who came from no faith tradition at all."
This got me thinking more expansively, while at the same time, more specifically, individually. I wondered: if all other religions passed away and the Religion of Fred remained, what kind of world would be possible?
Maybe that sounds too simplistic – too idealistic or dreamy. Probably, but aren't all spiritual traditions propagated and propelled forward to a great extent by ideals and dreams?
"I like you just the way you are." Some may say Fred was shaped by his Presbyterian roots. Others may say he shaped his own unique religion based on a belief in people with more concern for Goodness than God.
Carvell Williams summarizes "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" as "a beacon, a map, a guide for how to treat one another with kindness ... to see ourselves in one another and to accept the ways in which we're different."
This wide-open neighborhood may not be a garden to grow a new religion. On the other hand, we may find that seeing ourselves through the eyes of children is the only kind of religion that holds roots, shoots and fruits for the future of the neighborhood – nurtured by all neighbors in the human family.

Welts: I’m forever grateful for Stern

Texto completo: AP Basketball Writer
When Rick Welts bought his first home in California he eagerly invited his boss at the time, then-NBA commissioner David Stern, over to show it off.
So Stern visited. Predictably, he told Welts everything that was wrong with the place.
Welts, now the president of the Golden State Warriors, made all of Stern’s recommended changes — and the house is pretty much perfect. That house was where Welts was on Wednesday when the text message came to say that Stern — his mentor, a second father in many respects — had died.
Stern’s death hit the entire NBA hard, even though the league had been bracing for it in the days since the former commissioner was struck by a brain hemorrhage last month. But for Welts, one of the people fortunate enough to have had an intimately close working relationship with Stern, the loss goes even beyond the level of profound.
“He really lived his life and inspired people around him to constantly reevaluate the way they see the world,” Welts said on Friday in a phone interview. “He wanted people to not be afraid to try something different than what we were comfortable with.”
In Welts’ case, that credo rang most true in 2011 when he decided to come out as gay in an article published by The New York Times. He told Stern before the article was printed, and the two men hugged for what Welts believes was the first time.
But the process of knowing Stern would have his back at that ultimate moment started 17 years earlier.
Welts’ partner at that time had died of an AIDS-related issue. Welts, then living in New York, was super-secretive about his personal life and lifestyle. None of his co-workers at the NBA, least of all his boss — Stern — knew that he was gay, or so he thought.
So when his partner died, Welts couldn’t tell anyone at work. He took out a death notice advertisement in The Seattle Times, announcing his partner’s death and how memorials could come in the form of donations to a newly created scholarship fund at their alma mater, the University of Washington.
Welts flew to Seattle for the service. He went to the post office and picked up the envelopes from people who sent checks in his partner’s memory. He opened them on the plane ride back to New York. One of them was from Scarsdale, N.Y, and contained a $10,000 check from David and Dianne Stern.
“Honestly, even to this day, even though we discussed it later, I have no idea how he did that,” Welts said. “I really don’t. I don’t have any idea. We didn’t have the internet. There was no way that one little ad in Seattle, Wash., could’ve caught his attention, and he made a gesture that was pretty profound to me because it said a lot without saying anything.”
Welts remembers Stern as a champion for societal change. When he actually told Stern he was gay, Stern’s reaction was akin to saying, “So what?” Stern knew it was a big deal but simply wished it wouldn’t be one. He said he longed for a time where what largely remains earth-shattering news — someone being gay, or a player coming out as gay, or a woman being hired as a coach in a men’s league and a male-dominated field — would be commonplace.
Besides, Welts already knew Stern’s stance on equality matters. Stern wanted to grow the women’s game, so the WNBA was born. When Kobe Bryant directed a gay slur toward a referee in 2011, Stern almost immediately fined him $100,000. The NBA put out PSAs using star players who urged viewers to not use hateful terms. If there was an ail in society that Stern thought the NBA’s platform could reach and repair, he wanted to make it happen.
“It was just second nature,” Welts said. “It was in his DNA. It wasn’t like, he had a revelation about something. It’s just who he was.”
The tributes have poured in since Stern died and will continue for the foreseeable future. The NBA announced Friday that players and uniforms will wear a commemorative black band in Stern’s memory for the remainder of the season. A memorial is being planned, and it’ll likely attract every big name in the sport.
The last time Welts and Stern saw each other was a few weeks ago. They had lunch at the same restaurant where Stern was when the hemorrhage occurred.
“It’s just hard to imagine a world without him because he’s such a big presence,” Welts said. “I had been very lucky to have had that lunch with him. He’d never been more in his game. He was never more engaged, more excited about everything he was working on, more critical of everything that I was doing. He was 100% himself. It’s kind of a great memory to hold onto because I want to remember him that way.”

APOCALYPSE BECOMES THE NEW NORMAL

Texto completo: The past week's images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated "fire tornadoes" powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
The thing is, Australia's summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Notice that I said "related to" rather than "caused by" climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
In recent years, however, climate scientists have tried to cut through this confusion by engaging in "extreme event attribution," which focuses on probabilities: You can't necessarily say that climate change caused a particular heat wave, but you can ask how much difference global warming made to the probability of that heat wave happening. And the answer, typically, is a lot: Climate change makes the kinds of extreme weather events we've been seeing much more likely.
And while there's a lot of randomness in weather outcomes, that randomness actually makes climate change much more damaging in its early stages than most people realize. On our current trajectory, Florida as a whole will eventually be swallowed by the sea, but long before that happens, rising sea levels will make catastrophic storm surges commonplace. Much of India will eventually become uninhabitable, but killing heat waves and droughts will take a deadly toll well before that point is reached.
Put it this way: While it will take generations for the full consequences of climate change to play out, there will be many localized, temporary disasters along the way. Apocalypse will become the new normal - and that's happening right in front of our eyes.
The big question is whether the proliferation of climate-related disasters will finally be enough to break though the opposition to action.
There are some hopeful signs. One is that the news media has become much more willing to talk about the role of climate change in weather events.
Not long ago it was all too common to read articles about heat waves, floods and droughts that seemed to go to great lengths to avoid mentioning climate change. My sense is that reporters and editors have finally gotten over that block.
The public also seems to be paying attention, with concern about climate change growing substantially over the past few years.
The bad news is that growing climate awareness is mainly taking place among Democrats; the Republican base is largely unmoved.
And the anti-environmental extremism of conservative politicians has, if anything, become even more intense as their position has become intellectually untenable. The right used to pretend that there was a serious scientific dispute about the reality of global warming and its sources. Now Republicans, and the Trump administration in particular, have simply become hostile to science in general. Hey, aren't scientists effectively part of the deep state?
Furthermore, this isn't just a U.S. problem. Even as Australia burns, its current government is reaffirming its commitment to coal and threatening to make boycotts of environmentally destructive businesses a crime.
The sick irony of the current situation is that anti-environmentalism is getting more extreme precisely at the moment when the prospects for decisive action should be better than ever.
On one side, the dangers of climate change are no longer predictions about the future: We can see the damage now, although it's only a small taste of the horrors that lie ahead.
On the other side, drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions now look remarkably easy to achieve, at least from an economic point of view. In particular, there has been so much technological progress in alternative energy that the Trump administration is trying desperately to prop up coal against competition from solar and wind.
So will environmental policy play a role in the 2020 campaign? Most Democrats seem disinclined to make it a major issue, and I understand why: Historically, the threat posed by right-wing environmental policy seemed abstract, distant and hard to run on compared with, say, Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.
But the wave of climate-related catastrophes may be changing the political calculus. I'm not a campaign expert, but it seems to me that campaigns might get some traction with ads showing recent fires and floods and pointing out that Donald Trump and his friends are doing everything they can to create more such disasters.
For the truth is that Mr. Trump's environmental policy is the worst thing he's doing to America and the world. And voters should know that.

Texto completo: An editorial from The New York Times
Congress invited predatory for-profit colleges to defraud military veterans when it wrote a loophole into the rules governing federal education aid. The loophole, added to the Higher Education Act in 1998, encouraged the schools to take the education aid of Americans who had served the country while giving them valueless degrees - or no degrees at all - in return.
A bipartisan bill pending in the Senate would close this loophole. But Congress has a lot more to do if it intends to curb these fly-by-night schools - for instance, by forcing the Department of Veterans Affairs to use the authority it already has to stop education fraud.
Congress amended the Higher Education Act two decades ago as part of what has become known as the 90/10 rule. The rule requires for-profit schools to get at least 10% of their revenue from sources other than federal student aid. This common-sense effort was intended to prevent the federal aid program from becoming the sole revenue source of inferior schools that could not attract private support. But Congress undermined the rule by allowing for-profit schools to essentially count some federal aid - including GI education benefits and Department of Defense tuition assistance - as privately raised.
Not long after World War II, sham schools sprang up to cheat veterans of their GI Bill benefits, with fake courses, false attendance records and the like. One federal report published during the 1950s concluded that hundreds of millions of dollars had been "frittered away on worthless training." Another 1950s report estimated that of the more than 1.6 million veterans who had attended for-profit schools, only 1 in 5 had completed the course of study.
These 70-year-old complaints are still being echoed in lawsuits and enforcement actions aimed at for-profit schools all over the United States. On Dec. 10, for example, the Federal Trade Commission reached a $191 million settlement with the for-profit University of Phoenix to resolve charges that the school falsely promoted its educational benefits and used deceptive marketing materials that "targeted active-duty service members, veterans and military spouses." And a year ago, Career Education Corporation, another for-profit college operator, agreed to forgo more than half a billion dollars in debt owed by former students to settle charges in 48 states and Washington, D.C., that it had preyed upon students with deceptive practices.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, which has broad powers to combat fraud, has come under withering criticism for failing to protect veterans and service members from such practices. A 2016 analysis by Yale Law School's Veterans Legal Services Clinic hammered the department for sitting on its hands even though it has the authority to "approve, disapprove and suspend GI Bill funds for educational institutions engaged in deceptive recruiting practices." Beyond that, the Yale team found, the VA has "declined to support - or has even undercut" - state-level efforts to protect veterans from unscrupulous or noncompliant schools.
A 2016 federal statute requires programs receiving GI Bill money to meet state licensure and certification requirements. Nevertheless, a 2018 report from Veterans Education Success, a nonprofit that provides legal help to veterans, found that, owing to inaction by the VA and its state agents, degree programs that did not qualify students for state licensure in their fields of study were still receiving GI Bill money.
The bipartisan Senate bill aimed at closing the 90/10 loophole stands a good chance of succeeding where similar bills, supported only by Democrats, have repeatedly failed. The Senate also ought to pass the Protect the GI Bill Act, which cleared the House by unanimous vote in November. Among other things, it would clamp down on deceptive recruiting and protect students from fake law schools that are not approved by the American Bar Association.
Servicemen and women - and the taxpayers who fund their educations - deserve at least that much.

I'M LEAVING TWITTER. SOON. PROMISE. NO, SERIOUSLY.

Texto completo: Being a bear of very little willpower, I mostly avoid resolutions, New Year's or otherwise, but there is one I am determined to uphold in 2020.
See that? I could not even carry one squishy policy through an entire paragraph.
Anyway, in the year 2020, a presidential election year, I will at some point rid myself of Twitter, thus providing a major boost to my mental health. More importantly, I will rid Twitter of me, a wondrous blessing to untold thousands.
It won't be easy. Cold turkey is out of the question. Without Twitter, how will I know whether the Washington Capitals have canceled the morning skate? Where will I access pictures of the latest caloric blitzkrieg concession item coming to a ballpark near you? Where will I go for digital spitting matches among the riotously misinformed? How will the Pentagon and I know which country we've pulled out of overnight?
I'm not sure I can function in the world of actual reality, where, when a person tells me, as they doubtless will, "You're an idiot," I won't even know if he or she neglected the apostrophe.
No, you can't rip Twitter away like a scab. I've been on it for about 10 years, meaning I'm totally compromised by its addictive algorithms. On every visit I enjoy it less, scrolling doggedly for something that will trigger outrage or fear, and Twitter loves me for it.
For a time, the feeling was mutual. I followed comics, scholars, musicians, artists, sports entities, reliable media outlets, respected commentators, esteemed colleagues and people I don't know but who always make me laugh or think or both. Back then, there was no shortage of retweeted malignant idiocy, but the only really aggravating feature of the young social media platform was the tendency by some users to assume they'd written the rules.
"You shouldn't block anybody," somebody said. "It's cowardly."
What are you, the Commissioner of Twitter?
I'll block you if I don't like your tone, and I can't even hear it, OK? I block more people before 9 a.m. than the Army does all day. If you took every offensive lineman in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, they would not have blocked as many people as I have. Frankly, the block is Twitter's best feature. Off with their heads! That's my policy.
Seriously, I shouldn't have to read your crap, nor you mine. Block away.
I even remember my first tweet: "Happy John Lennon's birthday everybody. Imagine all the people living life in peace."
Or my first notification: "Yeah well imagine you suck!"
Sooo Twitter.
Now, of course, the stakes are at their all-time highest. Something wicked this way comes. The election looms and there's probably no way it won't be the second presidential election in a row to be poisoned by foreign interference in social media. If nothing else, when I finally exit the platform, I'll be able to say, "Russia, if you're listening, I am not. OK?" Nor will I be listening to Ukraine, China and any other nation state or sinister actor the president invites to bastardize the results between now and November.
Americans who read the Mueller Report (likely fewer than a dozen), know that Russia, through its Internet Research Agency, weaponized Twitter so expertly in 2016 that it actually arranged "confederate rallies" and organized "Kids for Trump" among other trolling efforts. Some of these meetings organized by phony Russian Twitter accounts drew hundreds of supporters.
Unfortunately, this kind of thing can no longer be laughed off. If you think Twitter is irresponsible in this way, know that Facebook and others are demonstrably worse. All of these platforms harbor the potential for miraculous communication and profound societal good, but the downside is so dark as to be almost too dark.
"Communities are being ripped apart as prejudice, hate and disinformation are peddled online," Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web and co-founder of the World Wide Web Foundation, wrote for The New York Times barely a month ago. "Scammers use the web to steal identities, stalkers use it to harass and intimidate their victims, and bad actors subvert democracy using clever digital tactics. The use of targeted political ads in the United States' 2020 presidential campaign and in elections elsewhere threatens once again to undermine voters' understanding and choices. We are at a tipping point. How we respond to this abuse will determine whether the web lives up to its potential as a global force for good or leads us into a digital dystopia."
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do by abandoning Twitter, avoid digital dystopia. That sounds like good advice any time.
Sacha Baron Cohen, who reliably proves that we can laugh and cringe simultaneously, recently delivered one of the most incisive speeches on this topic to the Anti-Defamation League. I urge you to Google it, if only to see the hellacious verbal flogging Mr. Cohen gives Google, Facebook and others.
"Today around the world, demagogues appeal to our worst instincts," he said in November. "Conspiracy theories once confined to the fringe are going mainstream. It's as if the Age of Reason - the era of evidential argument - is ending, and now knowledge is delegitimized and scientific consensus is dismissed. Democracy, which depends on shared truths, is in retreat, and autocracy, which depends on shared lies, is on the march. Hate crimes are surging, as are murderous attacks on religious and ethnic minorities."
Only last weekend, someone with a machete burst into a suburban New York home during a Hanukkah celebration, attacking five, slashing and battering one old man into a coma.
It was just weeks after Mr. Cohen quoted Voltaire: "Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities."

FOUR HOURS IN PACIFIC PALISADES; Where 'oms' and 'ahs' float on ocean breezes

Texto completo: January in Los Angeles is a special time: The air feels a little crisper, there's snow coating the mountains in the distance, and many Angelenos are just easing back into their regular schedules while trying to be mindful of their New Year's resolution. Whether your resolution has you experimenting with veganism, meditating or spending more time in nature -- or some impressive combination of the three -- Pacific Palisades provides an ideal place to take a breath and recharge before diving into 2020. Before hitting the road, throw a beach blanket and a few extra layers in your bag -- when you make a trip to this picturesque seaside neighborhood, it's a shame to miss a visit to the beach, no matter the season.
--
1 p.m.

Ease into a day of relaxation with a stop for lunch at Matthew's Garden Cafe at 859 1/2 Swarthmore Ave. off the Palisades' main shopping district. Walking into Matthew's is like discovering a treasure hidden in plain sight; from the street, diners walk through a narrow passage onto a lush patio with tables. If you're tired of the rich meats and sweets of the holiday season, the restaurant's wholesome salads and sandwiches are a surefire way to transition back to the simpler pleasures of everyday dining. The jasmine salad and chicken pesto panini make for a particularly satisfying lunch, especially coupled with a tea or coffee. After you finish lunch, don't leave in a hurry; Matthew's is one of those places diners can feel comfortable lingering and soaking in the surroundings.
--
2:10 p.m.
Even if your New Year's resolution has you avoiding animal products or gluten, you won't have trouble finding plenty of places for dessert in the Palisades. A short walk across Antioch Street and Sunset Boulevard is Sweet Laurel Bakery at 15279 Sunset Blvd., an overwhelmingly pink and predictably expensive bake shop nestled in the Palisades' posh shopping district. Despite the $10 price tag on slices of cake, anyone searching for a new grain-free or dairy-free dessert option, or just curious about how the 1% consumes its calories, should stop in for a slice of vanilla coconut jam cake or a few snickerdoodle cookies.
--
2:30 p.m.
Time to hit the road. Drive 2.5 miles west along Sunset Boulevard to the Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine at 17190 Sunset Blvd.; you might spot the Golden Lotus Archway or windmill chapel from the road. The shrine is a regular contender on internet lists of the best places in L.A. to relax, meditate and, my personal favorite, "harvest your inner calm." Amateur bloggers and the New York Times alike are right to call attention to the shrine -- and there's a lot more to understand about the shrine than its undeniable feeling of peacefulness.
Once you arrive, take a moment to pick up a brochure and read about the shrine's history before taking a walk through the Meditation Garden. I recommend keeping an eye out for all of the different religious influences found within the gardens, from the Mary and baby Jesus on display to the statue of Krishna playing his flute. In some ways, the variety of religious iconography at the shrine can be seen as a testament to the fusion of cultures that makes Los Angeles unique.
--
4 p.m.
After finishing at the shrine, continue oceanward on Sunset Boulevard to Pacific Coast Highway and turn left, heading back toward L.A. After a mile and a half, you'll reach Will Rogers State Beach at 17000 Pacific Coast Highway, a clean, relatively crowd-free stretch of coast ideal for watching sunsets.
If the beach looks familiar, you might recognize it from one of the many movies and TV shows shot there -- including "Baywatch." The best part? There's ample parking, either in the lot or along Temescal Canyon Road.
Grab a blanket and a few extra layers from the trunk (it gets chilly on the beach at twilight) and find a spot to watch the sunset. Once you're settled in and layered up, keep an eye on the horizon: You might just see some dolphins jumping through the waves.

Texto completo: Ari Aster's sophomore horror film is available to stream, and a new mini-series from the creators of "Sherlock" hits Netflix.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
What's Streaming
MIDSOMMAR (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, Vudu or YouTube. Ari Aster made waves in 2018 with the release of his debut feature, "Hereditary." A year later, he delivered another haunting watch, "Midsommar." The protagonists, Dani (Florence Pugh) and Christian (Jack Reynor), are on the verge of breaking up until a family tragedy brings them closer. Not close enough, that is, as Christian is emotionally detached while a grieving Dani clings onto him for comfort. Months later, Christian reluctantly invites Dani to join him and his friends at a festival in a remote Swedish village that occurs every 90 years. The group arrives at the sun-kissed landscape in awe, until they realize they have entered the terrain of a pagan cult. Needless to say, terror ensues. Aster tried to center the horror around Dani and Christian's deteriorating relationship, yet critics have said their back story was not given enough weight to begin with. Aster's real strength, Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times, "is the setup, that part when he lays out his characters, their worlds and the menace that closes on them like a claw."
DRACULA Stream on Netflix. Mark Gatiss and Steven Moffat, the creators of "Sherlock," joined forces yet again to write this new mini-series for BBC and Netflix. The show adapts Bram Stoker's classic tale, telling the origin story of Count Dracula (Claes Bang of "The Square") with a gory, modern twist. It debuted in Britain on Jan. 1 to positive reviews. The Guardian called it a "diabolic luxury" while The Sun said the occasional one-liner lends some fun to the grisly scenes.
What's on TV
THE AFTERMATH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. Keira Knightley and Alexander Skarsgard play grief-stricken lovers in this wartime romantic drama by the director James Kent ("Testament of Youth"). Rachael (Knightley) arrives in postwar Hamburg in 1946 to reunite with her husband Lewis (Jason Clarke), a British colonel in charge of rebuilding the city. The couple lost their son during the Blitz, and their marriage has been on thin ice ever since. They settle into a mansion requisitioned from Stephen (Skarsgard), a German widower. Rachael is seething when Lewis offers to share the space with Stephen and his daughter. But soon enough her animosity gives way to desire, and a love triangle unfolds under one roof. The film has been praised for its dazzling visuals, yet critics have said it lacks nuance and emotional depth.
SURVIVING R. KELLY: PART II: THE RECKONING 8 p.m. on Lifetime. "Surviving R. Kelly," the documentary series that explored sexual abuse allegations against the R&B singer, comes to a close with this sequel. The final episode revisits the aftermath of Kelly being taken into federal custody and spotlights the families of two of his live-in girlfriends who largely defended him when the allegations surfaced.

Texto completo: President Trump, who has been gripped by anxiety about evangelical voters abandoning him, took wide swipes at Democratic rivals one day after the strike on a top Iranian leader.
MIAMI -- In his first public appearance since the strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani of Iran, President Trump rallied his evangelical Christian base of supporters on Friday, portraying himself as the restorer of faith in the public square and claiming that God is "on our side."
Mr. Trump brought to the stage Cissie Graham Lynch, a granddaughter of Billy Graham, the founder of Christianity Today, to offer an implicit rebuke of the magazine's recent editorial calling for his removal from the White House.
Ms. Lynch's appearance underscored how sensitive Mr. Trump was about any signs of fracturing in his base; many evangelical allies denounced the editorial, and Ms. Graham Lynch vowed on Friday to help Mr. Trump win re-election. She then welcomed a supporter to the stage who told attendees that they could not trust what the news media wrote about the president.
Mentioning the attack in Baghdad only briefly, the president spent his hourlong speech at Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesús, a church with a predominantly Hispanic congregation, alternating between his familiar mocking jabs at Democrats, who he repeatedly called anti-religious, and boasting about his own faith-based policies. Saying he would renew the importance of religion and family, Mr. Trump vowed that he would toughen restrictions on abortion and would take action to "safeguard students and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools."
In remarks highlighting his support for Israel, Mr. Trump also attacked Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.
"Where do these people come from?" Mr. Trump said. "These people hate Israel. They hate Jewish people."
Mr. Trump's comments were repeatedly met with enthusiastic cheers and chants of "four more years" from the crowded and sprawling church.
"Evangelical Christians of every denomination and believers of every faith have never had a greater champion, not even close, in the White House, than you have right now," Mr. Trump said. "We've done things that nobody thought was possible. Together we're not only defending our constitutional rights. We're also defending religion itself, which is under siege."
Mr. Trump began his remarks by mentioning the killing of General Suleimani and praising the military, on a day when many Democratic officials and presidential candidates have questioned the president's decision to order the strike and whether he has a broader strategy to deal with potential reprisals from Iran.
"He was planning a very major attack, and we got him," he added of General Suleimani. "We do not seek war, we do not seek nation building, we do not seek regime change, but as president, I will never hesitate to defend the safety of the American people."
Mr. Trump excited the crowd by repeatedly thanking them for their crucial support in 2016 and promising that "we're going to blow those numbers away in 2020."
Mr. Trump, who rarely made church visits in the 2016 presidential campaign and once mistook the plate offering communion for the collection plate, was described by his favorite pastor and current White House aide, Paula White, as a man of God who is "loyal to a T."
He again taunted Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts by referring to her as "Pocahontas" and mocked Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has spoken frequently about his faith, by claiming he had become religious just "two weeks ago."
"We can't let one of our radical left friends come in here because everything we've done will be gone in short order," he said. "They can take it away pretty quickly."
The event had been planned for several weeks, as an opportunity to highlight Mr. Trump's support from a group of voters who were critical to his victory in 2016.
Mr. Trump has been gripped by anxiety over evangelical voters abandoning him since soon after he took office. He has repeatedly tried to shore up his connection to evangelicals throughout his first term, repeatedly pointing to his move to fill dozens of open federal judicial posts with conservative jurists.
Mr. Trump was surprised when the publication Christianity Today wrote an editorial calling for his removal from office amid the House impeachment inquiry. Roughly 200 evangelicals wrote a letter denouncing the editorial -- and several evangelical leaders said it did not reflect a majority view among their voters.
Still, Mr. Trump was troubled by it, according to people close to him.
Outside the rally, supporters said they came to offer their unblinking support for the president. In a city where Hispanics make up 70 percent of the population, many supporters chatted with one another in Spanish as they waited for hours in the blazing Miami sun. The leader of the church, Guillermo Maldonado, made headlines last week when he promised the largely immigrant congregation that undocumented immigrants would not face deportation if they attended the event.
"He's talking from his heart," said Michelle Hoff, who came to the rally with two other women from her prayer group. "I can't remember when we had a president who was honest like he is. Like everyone else, he's a sinner saved by grace. A lot of people say stuff that they don't do. He's doing it."
Asked if she opposed anything the president said or did, Ms. Hoff said that she only wished he would appoint judges to fully overturn Roe v. Wade and same-sex marriage.
The rally inside the massive church began with energetic Christian rock, with many supporters clad in red MAGA hats dancing and lifting their hands in prayer.
Though all of the invited speakers were popular evangelical leaders and entertainers, many supporters outside were Cuban émigrés who said their primary concern was what they saw as the threat of socialism. Most said they were lifelong Republicans who were more concerned than ever about the Democratic Party gaining more power, citing fears that they would face more government mandates.
"America stands for itself," said Belkis Gonzalez, 57, a teacher who emigrated from Cuba three decades ago and wore a T-shirt emblazoned with "Socialism sucks," styled similarly to the logo for Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. "We are no longer giving money and free support to enemies of America and instead take strong action. We're not flaky and shaky anymore."

White House Refuses to Release 20 Emails About Ukraine Aid Freeze

Texto completo: It contends the release of the documents sought by The Times, would "inhibit the frank and candid exchange of views" in government decision-making.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration disclosed on Friday that there were 20 emails between a top aide to President Trump's acting chief of staff and a colleague at the White House's Office of Management and Budget discussing the freeze of a congressionally mandated military aid package for Ukraine.
But in response to a court order that it swiftly process those pages in response to a Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, lawsuit filed by The New York Times, the Office of Management and Budget delivered a terse letter saying it would not turn over any of the 40 pages of emails -- not even with redactions.
"All 20 documents are being withheld in full," wrote Dionne Hardy, the office's Freedom of Information Act officer.
The Times's information act request sought email messages between Robert Blair, a top aide to Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, an official in the White House's Office of Management and Budget who was in charge of handling the process for releasing $ 391 million in weapons and security assistance Congress had appropriated to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression.
In her letter, Ms. Hardy cited exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act for correspondence involving the president's staff and internal policy deliberations, suggesting that the disclosure of this material would "inhibit the frank and candid exchange of views that is necessary for effective government decision-making."
David McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, said the newspaper would challenge the blanket withholding of the documents and would ask the judge overseeing the lawsuit, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, to approve an expedited schedule for briefs and arguments given the urgent public interest in learning more about the dispute.
The heart of the accusation against Mr. Trump is that he abused his official powers, including withholding a promised White House meeting and congressionally mandated military aid, in an attempt to coerce Ukraine's president into announcing investigations that could deliver personal political benefits to Mr. Trump.
In October, the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee had also subpoenaed the Office of Management and Budget for all Ukraine-related documents, but the White House refused to produce them. It also instructed several key current and former officials with inside knowledge of the episode not to testify.
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, has portrayed Mr. Blair and Mr. Duffey as two of the four key witnesses he believes the Senate should call in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, along with Mr. Mulvaney and John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has expressed opposition to calling witnesses and again criticized the House investigation on Friday.
The Trump administration's move to withhold all the emails in full -- not even disclosing the dates they were sent, or the shape of paragraphs covered by black lines -- is a step beyond its heavy censorship of a related set of emails it released in response to another Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the Center for Public Integrity.
The documents released to the center consisted of about 300 pages of emails between the Office of Management and Budget and the Pentagon about the Ukraine aid package. While the officially released version was heavily redacted -- and the center is contesting the censorship in further litigation -- the visible portions showed, among other things, that Pentagon officials had worried that holding the funds could be an illegal impoundment.
A report on Thursday by the legal policy website Just Security added further fuel to the controversy by revealing what was under some, but not all, of the deletions. The website said it had been shown some of the emails in unredacted form, including an Aug. 30 message from Mr. Duffey to a Pentagon budget official stating that there was "clear direction from POTUS" -- an acronym referring to the president of the United States -- "to continue to hold" the Ukraine military assistance.
The Times separately reported this week that Mr. Blair warned Mr. Mulvaney to "expect Congress to become unhinged" if the White House went ahead with the hold on the aid.
Earlier on Friday, Mr. Schumer went to the Senate floor to praise the reporting by The Times, the Center for Public Integrity and Just Security as an additional reason for the Senate, as part of Mr. Trump's trial, to seek documents and testimony that the White House had blocked House impeachment investigators from obtaining.
"What constituted clear direction?" Mr. Schumer asked. "Did he get an order from the president, or did someone like Mr. Mulvaney get an order from the president passed on to Mr. Duffey? Was there discussion among officials about covering up for the president in delay of military assistance? These are questions that can only be answered by examination of the documentary evidence and by the testimony of key Trump administration officials under oath in a Senate trial."
At least four collections of emails have now been released, or shared with reporters, detailing correspondence between White House officials and their counterparts at the Office of Management and Budget or the Defense Department.
Over all, these exchanges show growing tension between the White House and the Pentagon in late August and early September, as Defense Department officials questioned if they would be able to spend all of congressionally appropriated military aid to Ukraine before the deadline at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.

Texto completo: More details about the former auto executive's escape emerged. The Japanese news media said cameras showed him leaving his Tokyo home alone.
TOKYO -- Carlos Ghosn was aided in his escape from Japan by an American security consultant who accompanied him on the flight out of the country, a person familiar with the matter said, while a Turkish charter jet company said on Friday that its planes were used illegally to pull off the plan.
The Japanese news media also reported on Friday that surveillance camera footage showed the disgraced auto industry mogul leaving his Tokyo home by himself on Sunday, a day before he turned up in Beirut, Lebanon.
With the new details, a clearer -- if still imperfect -- picture is emerging of how Mr. Ghosn, Japan's most prominent criminal defendant, managed to evade authorities. The American consultant, a former United States Green Beret named Michael Taylor, was introduced to the disgraced auto executive by Lebanese intermediaries months ago, said the person, who asked not to be identified to discuss a sensitive issue.
Turkish media outlets have reported that Mr. Taylor and another American were the only people listed as passengers on a manifest for the flight that carried Mr. Ghosn from Japan to Turkey. On Friday, MNG Jet, an aircraft charter company, said one of its employees had falsified records to remove Mr. Ghosn's name from the official documentation for two flights.
Taken together, the disclosures paint a picture of a dash across Japan to a waiting plane. Still, most of the details of his getaway remain unconfirmed by authorities in Japan, Turkey or Lebanon.
Mr. Ghosn -- who has maintained that he is innocent -- was facing four charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan and was set to go on trial sometime this year. But he escaped instead, saying that he did not trust what he called the "rigged" Japanese justice system to give him a fair trial. He built and once ran the Nissan-Renault auto alliance, one of the world's biggest car-making empires, but was arrested in November 2018.
News outlets in Turkey reported this week that Mr. Ghosn left on a plane from Osaka, Japan, late Sunday aboard a business jet and landed at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. He then switched planes and flew to Beirut, the reports said.
Mr. Taylor, a former member of an Army Special Forces team, works as a security consultant. He was once hired by The New York Times to assist in the rescue of David Rohde, then a Times reporter, who was kidnapped by militants in Afghanistan and held for seven months in Pakistan's tribal areas. Mr. Rohde ultimately escaped on his own in June 2009.
Mr. Taylor was indicted in 2012 for his role in a plan to obstruct a federal fraud investigation into bid rigging of Defense Department contracts. He served time in prison after pleading guilty to wire fraud, but the government returned $ 2 million that had been taken from him, as well as two Land Rovers, according to court records.
Mr. Taylor's involvement in Mr. Ghosn's escape was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
The news accounts of Mr. Ghosn's flight match the records of a Bombardier business aircraft operated by MNG Jet that took off from Osaka just after 11 p.m. local time and landed in Istanbul about 12 hours later, according to data from FlightAware, a flight tracking service.
MNG Jet said it had no indication the two flights were connected. It said that it filed a criminal complaint in Turkey on Wednesday and that it "hopes that the people who illegally used and/or facilitated the use of the services of the company will be duly prosecuted."
The company said the employee who falsified flight records had confessed to acting alone, without management's knowledge. MNG Jet did not disclose the employee's name.
Five people -- four pilots and MNG Jet's operations manager -- have been sent to pretrial detention by a Turkish court, according to local media reports, and an official at the ground services provider Havas said prosecutors had released two of its employees.
The jet company has also transported gold out of Venezuela, helping the government there in its efforts to raise cash, according to Caracas Capital, an investment bank that has been tracking the gold shipments. The movement of MNG's jets through Venezuela were confirmed by online flight trackers.
MNG is the "go-to company if you want to have something done," said Russ Dallen, the managing partner at Caracas Capital.
It is not clear how Mr. Ghosn, who was under heavy surveillance in Tokyo, eluded the authorities and make his way to Osaka, which is roughly 300 miles west of Tokyo.
In Japan on Friday, news outlets reported that Mr. Ghosn walked out of his Tokyo home alone on Sunday but never came back. The news reports cited anonymous sources with knowledge of footage of the cameras surrounding his rented house in a central district of the city.
Prosecutors are investigating whether Mr. Ghosn, after leaving his home, met up with a group that helped his escape to Lebanon, according to the national broadcaster NHK and the economic daily Nikkei Shimbun.
The footage described in the news reports was from security cameras installed in front of the two-story house in the city center, the outlets reported. Three surveillance cameras had been installed above the doorway of Mr. Ghosn's house as part of a bail agreement that placed tight restrictions on his movements.

Texto completo: The Department of Housing and Urban Development, hoping to lower housing costs, will propose new rules that reverse Obama-era efforts to desegregate housing.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration plans to propose pulling back Obama-era efforts to desegregate housing, saying that people should have the opportunity to live where they want as long as they are protected from discrimination and housing is affordable.
The Obama administration argued that in order to fulfill the Fair Housing Act of 1968, states, local governments and public housing agencies had to address disparities in housing, integrate neighborhoods and transform racially concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity.
An Obama-era rule pressed state and local governments and public housing agencies to collect local and regional data on patterns of integration and segregation, and use it to promote fair housing and equal opportunity.
The Trump administration plans to propose a rule next week that will pull back those guidelines, arguing that they are onerous and actually holding back the construction of affordable housing. "Fair housing choice," the new proposal says, is ensuring that people have the opportunity and option to live "where they choose" as long as there is no "unlawful discrimination."
Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, said in August 2018 that the current rule, "which was designed to expand affordable housing choices, is actually suffocating investment in some of our most distressed neighborhoods that need our investment the most."
Fair housing experts worry that the Trump administration is merely trying to get the Department of Housing and Urban Development out of civil rights enforcement.
If the rule is finalized, "ongoing housing discrimination and segregation will likely continue to be swept under the rug and HUD resources will do far less to reduce segregation and expand housing opportunities" for protected groups, said Peggy Bailey, the vice president for housing policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
The housing department has not released its annual fair housing report since 2017, but the National Fair Housing Alliance found that the number of housing discrimination complaints rose 8 percent in 2018 over 2017, the highest increase since 1995.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the proposed rule after The Washington Post published its account. The housing department did not respond to requests for comment on the proposed rule.
The proposed rule comes as the nation's biggest cities are trying to cope with housing crises and as homelessness rates have increased, especially on the West Coast. Black homeownership rates have declined to levels not seen since the 1960s. The department has already proposed a rule that would raise the bar for proving housing discrimination. The public comment period for that rule closed last August, and it is still under consideration.
The Fair Housing Act requires that recipients of HUD funding "affirmatively further" fair housing and equal opportunity but leaves it to the secretary of housing and urban development to decide what that means.
The Obama administration defined furthering fair housing as addressing "significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws."
The Trump administration would drastically pare that back to simply saying people should live "where they choose, within their means, without unlawful discrimination related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability." No mention of segregation appears in the new definition.
The 2015 Obama rule required recipients of HUD funding to work with the agency to assess the state of fair housing in their community. The recipients were then required to create fair housing goals. The Obama administration estimated that the rule would cost local entities $ 25 million a year and HUD $ 9 million annually.
Housing advocates saw that as money well spent.
"After several years of considerable input from stakeholders across the spectrum, the Obama administration's fair housing rule made the strongest effort in decades to reverse harmful patterns of segregation and discriminatory practices in communities across the country," Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement.
The proposed rule would change how the housing department evaluates whether local governments and housing agencies are advancing its fair housing goals. Under the rule, local governments would be evaluated based on whether they have been sued by the Departments of Housing and Urban Development or Justice and whether they have provided an adequate supply of quality affordable housing. Fair housing lawsuits by advocacy organizations like the National Fair Housing Alliance would not count against the local entities.
Localities would be free to come up with their own goals to address housing discrimination.
"This approach would allow jurisdictions to act as they deem necessary to achieve their results while allowing HUD to avoid micromanaging localities," the proposed rule says.
The proposed rule also lists 17 obstacles that jurisdictions can choose to address, like wetland or environmental regulations, but those do not include racial discrimination.
Conservative housing experts agreed with the new direction.
"Too often, government mandates, restrictions and subsidies fuel rising costs," said Joel Griffith, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. "On the state level, onerous restrictions on zoning -- and on environmental regulations -- can add dramatically to the costs of housing,"
Advocates for fair housing say that focusing on the supply and quality of housing does not mean that racial minorities and other groups in the protected classes under the Fair Housing Act actually have access to the housing stock that is there. Nearly all of the obstacles listed in the proposed rule are focused on the supply of housing, not barriers to obtaining it.
There will be a 60-day public comment period once the rule is proposed. The department will have to consider the comments before finalizing the rule.
The latest proposal joins three other proposed rules that have elicited criticism from housing advocates. In addition to one that would raise the bar for proving housing discrimination, another would bar families with undocumented immigrants from receiving housing assistance. The public comment period closed last July, and over 30,000 public comments were submitted. The department must consider those comments before completing the rule. The other would weaken legal protections for transgender people in homeless shelters.

Texto completo: He was praised as a hard-driving coach willing to go against the grain. He was also fined for keeping a female reporter out of the team's locker room.
Sam Wyche, who was the last coach to lead the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl, but who was later fined by the National Football League for barring a female reporter from the team's locker room, died on Thursday at his home in Pickens, S.C. He was 74.
His family said the cause was complications of melanoma.
Wyche coached for several N.F.L. teams but was most closely associated with the Bengals. He began his career as a backup quarterback for the team in 1968, the franchise's first year.
After seven undistinguished seasons playing for four teams, Wyche joined the San Francisco 49ers in 1979 as quarterbacks coach, working under Coach Bill Walsh to develop a rookie quarterback named Joe Montana. In their third year together, the team won its first Super Bowl.
After a year coaching at Indiana University, Wyche, then a relatively young 38, took over in 1984 as head coach of the Bengals, where Walsh had been quarterbacks coach before departing for San Francisco. He quickly took an unconventional approach in turning the team into an offensive juggernaut.
In his first season in Cincinnati he benched Ken Anderson, the team's popular longtime quarterback, and replaced him with Boomer Esiason, a rookie. Bengals teams were among the top 10 in the league in offense in five of the next six seasons.
On Twitter on Thursday, Esiason praised Wyche as "an innovator" who "took chances that no coach ever would."
During that run of success, Wyche was also widely credited with being the first coach to routinely use the no-huddle offense to keep defenses off kilter. The strategy, which includes only brief moments for play-calling, had been typically used at the end of games, when teams behind in the score rush to catch up. Wyche's decision to use the strategy more frequently helped propel the Bengals to a 12-4 finish in 1988, when they had the league's top-ranked offense.
"I like gambling and taking chances; it's what life is all about," Wyche told The New York Times that season. "Fans are having fun and players have fun, so why can't coaches have fun, too?"
After winning the A.F.C. Championship for only the second time in their history, the Bengals lost, 20-16, to Walsh's 49ers in Super Bowl XXIII. The 49ers sealed the victory when Montana tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds remaining. (The Bengals have never returned to the Super Bowl.)
Known as a fiery and hard-driving coach willing to go against the grain, Wyche made waves for another, more embarrassing reason two years later. In October 1990, the N.F.L. fined Wyche $ 27,000, a record for a coach, for preventing a female reporter, Denise Tom of USA Today, from entering the team's locker room. He was unrepentant, saying that women shouldn't be able to walk in on players while they were naked.
"No amount of fine will force me to change my conviction on this matter," he told reporters. "We need to find a way for women to have a decent and open access to all these athletes. The commissioner feels like it's more important to fine me than to seek another solution."
Wyche had been fined twice before, once for knocking a microphone out of a reporter's hand and once for barring all reporters from the team's locker room after a loss. The third fine, though, came just weeks after another reporter, Lisa Olson of The Boston Herald, complained that she had been surrounded by several naked players in the New England Patriots' locker room and verbally abused.
Wyche's willingness to buck convention extended to the field. He ran up the score on opponents, once ordering an onside kick even though his team was ahead 45-0. He was also outspoken. He criticized fans in Cleveland for throwing debris on the field and implored fans in Cincinnati to stop throwing snowballs.
After a 3-13 finish in 1991, Wyche, with several years remaining on his contract, left Cincinnati for Tampa, where he coached the Buccaneers for four seasons. Though he led the Bengals during one of the franchise's more successful stretches, he had only a 61-66 record there (plus 3-2 in the playoffs) and a 23-41 record in Tampa.
He was quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bills in 2004 and 2005, then moved to Pickens, where he volunteered as a quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator for the town's high school team.
Samuel David Wyche was born on Jan. 5, 1945, in Atlanta. His father, Joseph, was a salesman, and his mother, Sarah, was a homemaker and, after the couple divorced, a secretary.
After graduating from North Fulton High School, he attended Furman University in Greenville, S.C., where he played quarterback. He earned a degree in business from Furman in 1966 and a master's degree in business from the University of South Carolina, his daughter, Kerry Wyche, said. He played for the Wheeling Ironmen, a semipro team in the Continental Football League, before signing with the Bengals.
Wyche married Jane Underwood, whom he met at Furman, in 1965. She and their daughter survive him, as do his son, Zachary, an assistant high school football coach in Cincinnati; a brother, Joe; and six grandchildren.
In 2016, Wyche underwent heart transplant surgery. Doctors told him the surgery would weaken his immune system and might make him susceptible to melanoma, his daughter said. Last month, doctors found cancer cells in his bones and liver.
Wyche seemed to embrace his role as coach and understood that he was always under the microscope.
"I have those nights like everyone when I wonder why I have the job I do," he told The Times in December 1989, a year after the Bengals made it to the Super Bowl. "But then I think of all the things this job has allowed me to do. I'm newsy; my position is newsy."

After a Year With 3 Cuts, The Fed Says Wait and See

Texto completo: The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2019. As an election year dawns, minutes from the December meeting show a renewed sense of patience.
SAN DIEGO -- In 2020, the Federal Reserve is hoping to give patience another try.
The Fed had an active 2019, as officials shifted away from a steady set of interest rate increases to pause before cutting rates three times in the face of trade tensions and global weakness. But at their final meeting last year, Fed officials signaled they plan to keep interest rates unchanged, at least for now.
Fed officials saw their current rate setting "as likely to remain appropriate for a time," so long as incoming economic information "remained broadly consistent" with the Fed's outlook for continued solid growth, according to minutes from the central bank's Dec. 10-11 meeting, released Friday.
Policymakers, including Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, made clear last month that they were comfortable leaving interest rates unchanged. Meeting notes underline that the pause could be an extended one. Officials are waiting to see how last year's cuts, along with a possible easing of trade tensions, will affect the American economy.
Fed meeting participants "expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective," the minutes show. "This outlook reflected, at least in part, the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy."
The Fed had lifted interest rates nine times between 2015 and late 2018 before cutting them three times last year between July and October. Rates now stand between 1.5 percent and 1.75 percent, much lower than they have historically been during economic expansions.
Yet officials showed no inclination to move rates in either direction as risks lingered on the economic horizon, especially as manufacturing weakens and trade-related threats remain.
"While many saw the risks as tilted somewhat to the downside, some risks were seen to have eased over recent months," the minutes said. "In particular, there were some tentative signs that trade tensions with China were easing, and the probability of a no-deal Brexit was judged to have lessened further."
At the same time, "new uncertainties had emerged regarding trade policy with Argentina, Brazil, and France, and political tensions in Hong Kong persisted."
Data released Friday showed that manufacturing continued to contract in December, even as some trade spats appeared to cool.
If the trade news going forward remains positive, "we've got a chance to see some stabilization," Robert S. Kaplan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said in an interview Friday in San Diego after the numbers were released.
"The moves we made, in my mind, having moved three times, were intended to address this weakness," he said. "I would have to see some material deterioration in the outlook to want to do something more."
And inflation, which has consistently fallen shy of the Fed's 2 percent target despite very low unemployment and a record-long economic expansion, is a major concern at the Fed, the minutes showed.
"Participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent," the minutes said, and "various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer-term inflation expectations was too low."
Against that backdrop, "maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushioning the economy" from global developments and helping lift inflation back up, the minutes said.
Mr. Powell, who leads the Fed's 17 policymakers, has said that he personally would want to see a sustained increase in inflation before considering raising interest rates, and a "material" miss to the Fed's economic outlook before cutting them.
The Fed's next meeting is Jan. 28-29 in Washington.

Suit Can Proceed Against Art Magazine

Texto completo: A New York appeals court clears the way for some of a former magazine employee's claims of retaliation against her in a #MeToo case.
In a ruling on one of the art world's notable #MeToo lawsuits, a court found that Artforum magazine can be held responsible for retaliation against a former employee -- but that Knight Landesman, the influential former publisher whom the employee accused of sexual harassment, legally remains in the clear.
Amanda Schmitt, who started at Artforum in 2009 when she was 21, filed a complaint in late 2017. Mr. Landesman -- accused in the lawsuit of groping, attempting to kiss, sending lewd messages to, or otherwise harassing at least nine women in incidents stretching back a decade -- resigned hours later. The other women were not named as plaintiffs.
Early last year, the lawsuit was dismissed. Last week, in a ruling first reported by Artnet News, a New York appeals court affirmed the dismissal of the retaliation claim against Mr. Landesman but ruled that Ms. Schmitt should be allowed to try to prove her claim against Artforum. (Lawyers for Artforum and Mr. Landesman declined to comment on Thursday.)
Rather than suing for workplace sexual misconduct, for which the statute of limitations had run out, Ms. Schmitt filed a suit accusing Mr. Landesman of retaliating against her. Mr. Landesman cornered her at a restaurant in May 2017 and demanded an explanation for having been "unfairly accused," she said. Too much time, however, had passed between her employment at Artforum -- Ms. Schmitt left the magazine in 2012 -- and the confrontation for it to qualify as retaliation, the lower court judge ruled in January 2019.
The explicit messages from Mr. Landesman continued after Ms. Schmitt left the magazine, and she said in the suit that she brought her concerns to two of Artforum's other co-publishers in June 2016. Ms. Schmitt, who still works in the art world, asserted in the lawsuit that after that meeting, the magazine began excluding her from its events -- which she said were essential for business development and meeting others in the industry.
A year later, when Ms. Schmitt began taking legal action, the magazine denied her allegations in a staff meeting and told employees that she was trying to "take down Artforum."
The magazine's "verbal and written disparagement" of Ms. Schmitt, the court decided last week, along with "allegations that Artforum sought to effectively freeze her out of the close-knit business," are still pertinent, even though the complaint against Mr. Landesman was dismissed.
Mr. Landesman had been a powerful mainstay in the art industry, and the allegations against him in 2017 represented a shift in the #MeToo reckoning. After he stepped down from Artforum, hundreds of artists, writers, curators and directors signed an open letter condemning him and vowing to address sexual misconduct in the art world.
Ms. Schmitt's lawyer, Emily Reisbaum, said in a statement that the appeals court's decision holds the magazine "accountable for its efforts to undermine her professionally after she sounded the alarm about Knight Landesman's years of abuse."
She added, "There is now no doubt, as Schmitt has been saying all along, that Artforum not only permitted Landesman's abuse to pervade its workplace and prestigious events, but it also punished Schmitt -- not Landesman -- for speaking the truth about his perversity."

To the Editor:
Re "Amy Klobuchar Raised $ 11.4 Million in Fourth Quarter, Her Campaign Says" (nytimes.com, Jan. 3):
Last fall my brother and sister-in-law hosted an event for Amy Klobuchar. It overflowed their small home.
People left impressed, though not everyone pledged to caucus for her or took a yard sign with them. It was a get-acquainted opportunity with a candidate who is characterized by strong suits like doggedness and diligence, which are time-released by definition.
As the field winnows, she is still standing, like the green Amy sign I came home with that night and planted in our yard. It wobbles on windy days, but is rooted deep enough to withstand winter in parts like these and New Hampshire. After that, we'll see if her campaign can muster enough financial fertilizer to blossom in the springtime.
Ms. Klobuchar might end up bolstering the Democratic ticket even if she's not atop it.

Higher Pay for Helpers
To the Editor:
Re "Real Charity: Pay Workers Living Wage" (DealBook, Dec. 24):
In reference to Andrew Ross Sorkin's suggestion that management and employees question and address their company's compensation inequality, I suggest that individuals ask themselves the same question.
Who is the poorest person you know? Is it your nanny, your house cleaner/housekeeper, your gardener, your dog walker, your mother's caregiver? You could pay them more, and not just as a year-end bonus.

Treating Hearing Loss
To the Editor:
Re "For Brain Health, Correct Mild Hearing Loss" (Personal Health, Dec. 31):
Jane Brody's article on untreated hearing loss provided readers with an excellent overview on research documenting the critical need for those with adult-onset hearing loss to seek treatment. Untreated hearing loss has been linked to dementia, an increased risk of falls and, of course, increased social isolation and depression.
While Ms. Brody is right that by 2021 low-cost over-the-counter hearing aids are expected to be available, these will be appropriate only for those with a mild to moderate hearing loss. And I would never encourage those who are struggling now to wait until 2021. At least start the process by having a hearing test done by an audiologist and get your questions answered about all of the new and upcoming options.

Texto completo: "Mayor Pete" is, technically, no longer Mayor Pete.
Pete Buttigieg's eight years in office in South Bend, Indiana, ended on New Year's Day as a new mayor was sworn in. Buttigieg, known colloquially as Mayor Pete almost since the start of his campaign last January, joined the ranks of former office holders seeking the presidency, who sometimes seem to hope that voters don't quite notice they have slipped from power.
Former Vice President Joe Biden, to cite one example, is not a former anything to his staff. In a heads-up to reporters last week, the Biden campaign advised that "Vice President Biden will attend a community event in Derry, New Hampshire."
Stylebooks may advise newsrooms to use "former" before titles of politicians out of office, but said former office holders can be touchy about giving up the aura of power and prestige - and it has become political courtesy regardless to refer to former officeholders by the titles they once held.
In an "exit interview" on Tuesday with a South Bend TV station, WNDU, Buttigieg professed to be "reluctant to hand over the keys" to his office, "just because I love the job so much." His mayoral chief of staff, Laura O'Sullivan, posted a picture of him at his desk in the County-City Building at 10:42 p.m. on New Year's Eve, dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, captioned "final quiet moments."
Buttigieg, who turns 38 on Jan. 19, has the rare distinction of being a presidential candidate whose day job ended in the heat of his national candidacy. He leaves the stewardship of the city, where he grew up, as a household name - though a name even locals sometimes stumble over. Is it "Buddha-judge," as most in South Bend seem to say, or, as the presidential campaign mnemonic has it, "Boot Edge Edge"?
One thing for sure: The candidate will no longer be able to say, "Mayor Pete is fine."
Elected when he was 29 - the youngest mayor ever of a city of more than 100,000 - Buttigieg announced in December 2018 that he would not seek a third term. He jumped into the presidential race one month later. Yearend fundraising figures his campaign announced on Wednesday reported a door-busting $24.7 million haul in the final quarter, and more than $76 million for the year.
"We started out as an exploratory committee with four people in a little office," Buttigieg reminisced about his presidential start in the exit interview on Tuesday. "We had no money, not much of a mailing list even."
Buttigieg may have left office, but his mayoral tenure will hardly recede. Heading into Iowa and New Hampshire voting next month as a leading candidate, his record is drawing strafing fire from opponents who question his experience and results.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in November that a woman who was mayor o: a city as small as South Bend would not have been taken seriously enough to make the debate stage. A Black Lives Matter group in South Bend has called a news conference for Saturday to highlight what it calls Buttigieg's "tolerance for racism by police," intending to keep alive an issue that has apparently dampened Buttigieg's appeal to Black voters nationally.
Buttigieg's last official act was to attend the swsaring-in of his successor, James Mueller, at the Century Center convention hall on the Saint Joseph River downtown. The former mayor entered with his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, and his mother, Jennifer Anne Montgomery, a former professor at the University of Notre Dame.
Mueller, a childhood friend who returned home from Washington to work as Buttigieg's chief of staff, was his handpicked successor. Little known before he ran, he bested a Democratic primary field featuring nine candidates, then cruised into office in November. As the new mayor was introduced, Buttigieg's husband placed a hand on the shoulder of the former mayor, who shot Mueller a broad smile.
"When I was growing up, success was synonymous with getting out," Mueller said. "On behalf of our city, I thank my predecessor, Mayor Pete, for leading us through our comeback decade."
Buttigieg did not speak formally. He planned to return to campaigning Thursday with seven stops in New Hampshire through the week. In the exit interview he said his house on the river in South Bend was not for sale.

Delaware bill to remove race checkbox from marriage license

Texto completo: Couples getting hitched in Delaware have long been required by law to list their race when applying for their marriage license.
But new legislation aims to scrap that law.
State Sen. Bryan Townsend realized in September that Delaware was one of a handful of states with such a provision when he read a New York Times article about a Virginia lawsuit filed by couples denied licenses because they wouldn't disclose their race.
A federal judge quickly ruled Virginia's law unconstitutional, and Townsend decided to change Delaware's law too.
"Historically, I think it was not there for the right reason. I think it comes from an era where people of different races weren't allowed to marry," said Townsend, a Newark-area Democrat.
He noted that, while a ban on interracial marriages in America was ruled unconstitutional in a 1967 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, until the 1980s Delaware still had a law on its books banning "marriage between a white person and a Negro or mulatto."
"I think it's a part of our past that's best left in the past. It's not germane to the marriage license. So let's clean it up in Delaware. Let's pass the law [as soon as possible] and move forward," Townsend told WHYY.
State Rep. Kendra Johnson, a Democrat whose district encompasses parts of the Bear and New Castle areas, is sponsoring the measure in the House.
"It's a big deal, if you happen to be the person who's completing that marriage license and you actually pay attention to it, and you see that someone is asking you for your race during one of the happiest times of your life," Johnson said. "And you know, ouch, what does that feel like?"
Delaware's marriage bureaus are not opposed to the change.
New Castle County Clerk of the Peace Ken Boulden has run the county marriage bureau for nearly a quarter century. He supports the change and has ordered his clerks not to pose the question to applicants starting Jan. 1.
"With the diversity that we are, the melting pot that we are, we are all a mix of something, we are a blend of something," Boulden told WHYY.
"And why is it even relevant? It's time we stopped recording that data and asking those questions. My staff is uncomfortable and most of all, most importantly probably, I don't want to make couples uncomfortable."
Boulden pointed out that Delaware's form lets people opt out of disclosing their race, and that a person's race does not appear on the marriage license itself.
State officials said they prepare a statistical report annually, based on the responses, but will implement any changes made by lawmakers.
The bill is scheduled for a hearing before the Senate committee hearing on Jan. 15. Townsend said he expects the bill to sail through the General Assembly.

10 OF THE DECADE'S MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOKS

Texto completo: A decade is in part defined by its books. And recent days have seen many roundups of the best books of the 2010s - the titles that critics consider the pinnacle of literary excellence.
But what about the decade's most influential books?
For better or worse, some authors and titles sent tidal waves through the decade - regardless of critical reception - shedding a light on what Americans really wanted to read and discuss over the past 10 years.
Here are 10 of the most influential tides of the decade. These books are sexy, courageous, vulnerable and venerated. Many have been adapted into films, merchandise or Netflix specials.
These are the printed works that most left their mark on the 2010s.
'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks' (2010)
The story of Henrietta Lacks remained largely in the dark until Rebecca Skloot unearthed a twisted history of race, ethics and poverty and launched her family's story to popular attention.
Lacks' cells - taken without her knowledge or consent during a biopsy - were discovered to have the remarkable ability to divide indefinitely. They soon became one of the most important tools in modern medicine, making it possible to develop such things as a polio vaccine, in vitro fertilization and gene mapping.
The story, now widely taught in schools and made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey, fueled an avalanche of acknowledgment of Lacks and her family. Her relatives have now been granted control of access to Henrietta's genomes and her portrait hangs proudly in the Smithsonian as "The Mother of Modern Medicine."
'Fifty Shades of Grey' (2011)
Despite the fact that everyone you know SWEAŔS they haven't read it, E.L. James's erotic novel and its sequels reigned sexy and supreme in the 2010s, claiming the top three spots on a list of the decade's bestselling books. The first book alone sold more than 150 million copies worldwide.
Initially written as "Twilight" fan fiction, the novel explores the relationship between sexually dominant millionaire Christian Grey and college student Anastasia Steele. Many found its sexual bondage scenes titillating, while others saw the book as a troubling depiction of BDSM relationships.
But "Fifty Shades" made its mark on the decade by taking the taboo and plastering it all over bookstores, best-seller lists and bedside tables worldwide.
The trilogy was adapted into a series of hit films co-produced by James and a line of "Fifty Shades" themed teddy bears, posters and erotic accessories.
So... did you read it? We won't tell.
'Gone Girl'(2012)
Millions of readers ripped through Gillian Flynn's thrilling tale of a missing wife, her suspicious husband and their seemingly blissful marriage suddenly shot to pieces.
The novel spent 26 weeks on NPR's hardcover bestseller list, sold more than 2 million copies in its first year and was adapted into a movie starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike.
While the novel in its own right was a popular success, Flynn's depiction of a woman driven to great lengths by the banality of her domestic life soon seemed to inspire many other thrillers, often featuring unreliable female narrators and with "Girl" or "Woman" in the title.
Think Paula Hawkins's "The Girl on a Train," Lauren Groff's "Fates and Furies," Lisa Lutz's "The Passenger" and A.J. Finn's "The Woman in the Window." The "Gone Girl" effect began a flood of suspense novels detailing the inner thoughts of women toeing the edge of reason and trying to convince readers of their motives.
T Am Malala'(2013)
Pakastani activist Malala Yousafzai was a leading voice in the global fight for girls' rights to education when she was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012.
The event, documented in her memoir "I Am Malala" shook the world, leading to the denouncement of the Taliban's actions by government leaders and human rights advocacy groups. In 2014, she became the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate in history.
"I Am Malala," translated into over 40 languages, presents the rich experiences and urgent message of the young activist whose life has rocketed girls' education equality to the forefront of international human rights conversations.
'Bad Feminist' (2014)
Roxane Gay is a self-proclaimed "bad feminist." She loves the color pink and blasts "thuggish rap at a very loud volume even though the lyrics are degrading to women and offend me to my core." She also writes that she is simultaneously committed to combating misogyny and fighting for gender equity.
A bestselling book of essays, "Bad Feminist" grasps at the slippery concept of modern feminism as Gay considers the stereotype of the militant, man-hating feminist and offers up humorous musings on what it's like to navigate race and gender in the age of Twitter, pop culture, and, yes, "Fifty Shades of Grey."
With her dry humor and fierce vulnerability, Gay has become one of the most prominent American authors of the decade, penning more than six books since 2011, including a memoir, a collection of short stories, and Marvel's "World of Wakanda."
'Just Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption' (2014)
The numbers don't lie. Year after year, the U.S. continues to have the highest incarceration rate in the world, disproportionately imprisoning African Americans in a system which makes it difficult for prisoners to regain their freedom.
Public interest lawyer Bryan Stevenson adds real faces and powerful narratives to these alarming statistics, asking in his memoir "Just Mercy" if it is possible to impart mercy in a justice system that is inherently broken.
"Just Mercy" is a compelling portrait of a lawyer dedicated to exposing the inequities of the U.S. criminal justice system while introducing readers to Walter McMillian, a Black man who was framed by police and wrongfully condemned to death row.
Stevenson masterfully connects his own fight with the struggles of McMillian and a few of his other former clients and personalizes the nation's raging debate on racial injustice and criminal justice reform.
The book was adapted into a new movie starring Jamie Foxx and Michael B. Jordan.
'The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up' (2014)
Marie Kondo's guide on the Japanese art of decluttering promises readers that if your home is truly organized, you will never be drowning in clutter again - an ideal that many readers strived for this decade.
The international bestseller created a widespread tidying phenomenon that had millions running around their homes, examining every tchotchke and piece of clothing over whether it would "spark joy"
The "KonMari" method became so popular that Kondo now stars in a cheerful Netflix special, "Tidying Up with Marie Kondo," and has launched her own home goods store full of things the organizational queen says bring her joy.
'Between the World and Me' (2015)
As a writer for The Atlantic, Coates had been interrogating the nation's history fraught with violence, exploitation and the struggle for power long before penning "Between the World and Me."
Written as a letter to his young son, Coates's memoir wields the nation's tangled history of race and power as a tool to grapple with contemporary blackness while articulating an intimate vision for his own son on how to inhabit the world while growing up Black.
The book earned a pile of accolades: National Book Award Winner, #1 New York Times Bestseller, NAACP Image Award Winner, Pulitzer Prize Finalist and more.
By presenting a new lens with which to examine the American present, Coates is helping lead the nation's ongoing conversation about police violence, racial injustice and reconciliation.
'The Underground Railroad' (2016)
Colson Whitehead's novel contorts the historical slave narrative of the Underground Railroad, transforming it into an unexpected parable for 21st-century readers.
The Underground Railroad in Whitehead's imagination is not the secret network of passageways and homes used to smuggle runaway slaves to freedom, but rather an actual underground railroad network. As his protagonist, a runaway slave named Cora, makes her way North on the railroad's various and unpredictable stops, readers are ushered through a series of harrowing experiences, each inspired by historical events, which remind them of the singularly disgusting machinery of slavery.
Whitehead's novel bravely retells a story often told by white writers while fusing a nation's shameful history with its present. The book has been widely recognized for its influence, winning both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.
'The Hate U Give'(2017)
Angie Thomas's debut young adult novel engages directly with the tangled topics of race and police violence as the book's narrator, a 16-year-old African American, becomes drawn into a national news story after witnessing a white police officer shoot and kill her unarmed Black friend.
Thomas' book engages directly with the Black Lives Matter movement, bringing the topic of police violence to young kids in an accessible way.
The novel was criticized by some as "anti-cop" and for containing drug use, profanity, and sexual references. Because of this, "The Hate U Give" made the American Library Association's list of most challenged books of 2018.
But it also resonated strongly with readers, remaining on the New York Times Bestseller list for 80 weeks and being adapted into an acclaimed movie starring Amandla Stenberg, who told NPR that reading the book was like "reading my own diary."

'Everything Isn't Terrible ' I am impressed by unflappable people –people who are calm in a way that allows for accomplishment without a lot of anxiety. Some are probably predisposed to unflappability. For the rest of us, there's a new guide to help us get there – :Everything Isn't Terrible: Conquer Your Insecurities, Interrupt Your Anxiety, and Finally Calm Down" by Dr. Kathleen Smith. Using practical exercises and a large helping of humor, Smith offers tools to deal more effectively with anxiety. Sarah Knight, New York Times bestselling author of "Calm the F*ck Down," calls it "the perfect blend of hard science and warm wit that helps you understand where your anxiety comes from and then manage the fallout." Smith will share some calm and laughs at Malaprop's at 6 p.m. on Jan. 9.
'Wayland' Known for her poetry, Rita Sims Quillen's new novel, Wayland, joins the growing ranks of extraordinary literature created in and about Appalachia. Set in southwestern Virginia in 1930, Wayland immerses us in the lives of Eva and Andrew Nettles and their adopted daughter – lives that feel uniquely blessed until they cross paths with Buddy Newman. Upon meeting this family, Newman commits himself to taking what they have, including their little girl. The desire is dark enough, but it's the method that sits us squarely on our seat's edge. He does not aim to steal or kidnap but to invisibly charm the Nettles's life out from under them. Quillen's poetic talent shines in her lyrical prose, clearly conjuring characters, place, time, and the growing tension as the story unfolds. Rita Sims Quillen will discuss Wayland at 6 p.m. on Jan. 8 at Malaprop's.

Texto completo: Knowing what people want simply makes sense if your business sometimes comes down to anticipating need. That's why restaurant consultants and marketing experts spend outsize effort analyzing food trends, tossing out ideas that sometimes seem practical, and other times just seem silly.
The rise of robot waiters predicted for 2019 comes to mind as a good example of the latter. And an expected explosion of food from Kazakhstan didn't quite reach Western North Carolina, much to at least my own dismay. And even if New York seems to be hogging more than its fair share of pelmeni, some food trends have boomed in Asheville for years, including the rising national hunger for gut-friendly probiotic-rich food or, simply put, ferments.
So what's next in the world of food? Here, I've shared some of the common ground I found in the trend forecasts for 2020. And since looking back can be equally fun, you can also take a gander at some of the things experts said would come to fruition this year, some of which did, and some of which did not.
Did romaine die in 2019? Let's kick things off with an unsavory anecdote. Unfortunately, E. coli wreaked havoc on romaine lettuce's reputation in 2019, and New York Times food writer Kim Severson rightly predicted the distrust of everyone's favorite vehicle for Caesar dressing would make way for alt-lettuces to steal the spotlight.
But tradition dies hard, and romaine is thankfully back in the salad bowl once again — the romaine salad with pickled veg, buttermilk dressing and corn nuts at East Asheville's Copper Crown is a fave. Local lettuces, romaine or no, are an Asheville menu staple, which means California-bred contaminations don't always hit us hard.
Severson also predicted an explosion in farms growing lettuce hydroponically, and locally that's come to fruition. The Massachusetts-based Little Leaf Farms, a grower of pesticide-free boxed baby greens, recently announced the imminent construction of 20 acres of high-tech hydroponic greenhouses in Yancey County. And BrightFarms, a New York-based packaged salad company, plans to invest $21 million to operate a hydroponic greenhouse in Henderson County.
Cheese tea and moldy food? Severson may have some sort of crystal ball, because she predicted 2019 would usher in cheese tea as "the thing you will try against your better judgment."
Reader, that happened to me, and it will not happen again. Regardless, if you're curious, you can find it at Moge Tee at 5 Biltmore Ave.
Nearly every food trend prognosticator said fermented foods would further increase mainstream reach, failing to freak out the general public quite as much. Indeed, anecdotally speaking, restaurant menus seem to be unapologetically boasting strong, funky flavors.
One memorable moment came from a summer dinner at Cultura, where our large group was presented with a platter including a few tiny and aggressively fermented cucumbers, the deeply complex flavor of which I can still recall months later.
And while koji is perhaps best known for its work in sake and miso, over at H&F Burger, which recently opened at 77 Biltmore Ave., the chefs are growing the fungus on beef to safely age the meat in record time.
That brings me to another trend: In late 2018, international food and restaurant consulting firm Baum + Whiteman predicted the rise of lab-grown meat would have ranchers "running scared." Technically, that means meat grown from cells in a lab, which is more high-tech than the Impossible Burger, which is so well-loved that restaurants experienced shortages this year.
I've yet to see real lab-grown meat anywhere, but steaks are ever more prolific in a town that used to have precious few. For example, a new steakhouse will open in 2020 in the Grove Arcade called Asheville Proper, a live-fire cooking concept courtesy of former Storm chef Owen McGlynn. I don't think ranchers are exactly running for the hills yet.
On the menu in 2020: special diets Still, acceptance of plant-based food is on the rise. Ingles dietitian Leah McGrath sees customers snapping up nondairy beverages, reformulated margarines and meat-free meats like chickenless "nuggets." Expect to see more variety in plant-based foods, with oat milk becoming a standard non-dairy option at cafes. Over at Blackbird Restaurant at 47 Biltmore Ave., there's an entire vegan menu, including risotto made with hemp milk.
At the same time, McGrath said, the high-protein, low-carb keto diet is likely to still gain traction this year, with more food companies loudly promoting keto-friendly products. They're even showing up in the frozen treat aisle, where shoppers can now find low carbohydrate "ice creams" with sugar alcohols, added protein and fiber.
An increasing desire to customize food to the diet du jour is making some restaurants rethink the way their menus are written.
"Unlimited customization may be gumming up service speed at fast-casual chains," said consulting group Baum + Whiteman's Michael Whiteman. Some restaurants are working to focus consumers' attention on culturally relevant pre-set "lifestyle bowls," marketed as keto or Whole 30-friendly, gluten-free and the like.
Some are toying with eliminating build-your-own bowls altogether, he said. "The lifestyle idea is spreading to pizza, so we predict that more chains (will) shift customers away from infinite invitations to choose individual ingredients."
Blaze Pizza, a chain operation with a couple local stores, now offers "lifestyle" options, like keto and cauliflower crust. The independent 828 Family Pizzeria offers cauliflower crust, too.
But not so fast: Baum + Whiteman also predicts either sweet potatoes or winter squash will soon usurp cauliflower as the "in" vegetable.
Waste not, want not QSR Magazine, a publication geared toward the fast-casual dining industry, suggests curbing food waste will continue to trend upward in 2020, as consumers begin to consciously invest in more sustainable businesses.
The USDA states the United States wastes about 66.5 million tons of food, which is more than any other country, except for Australia. The waste happens in various places, including on farm fields and in grocery stores, with more than 40% of the food tossed before consumers even touch it in restaurants and other food-service operations.
QSR predicts more and more food service operations will work to reduce food waste with technology, including food dehydrators and digesters. Local chefs are beginning to take the zero-waste kitchen challenge seriously.
Restaurants like Green Sage and The Corner Kitchen have long used local composting service Danny's Dumpster to handle their compostable trash. And with many local stakeholders, chefs and other food service workers present at the recent Asheville Food Waste Solution Summit, expect to see even more efforts toward community composting and other landfill diversion techniques.
That's a trend we can get behind.

Texto completo: WAUSAU - Wausau might retract its ban on snowball fights after the question of whether you can legally throw a snowball at a friend has again drawn the attention of national media outlets.
After some national headlines this month called Wausau "the worst town in America" for outlawing snowball fights, the City Council will consider removing the word "snowball" from the ordinance at its next meeting on Jan. 14.
It was first discussed in a public health and safety committee meeting on Dec. 16.
The city has had some fun with the attention, though. The police department and City Hall cleared it up with a video explaining the snowball ordinance, where Deputy Chief Matt Barnes threw a snowball right at the back of Mayor Robert Mielke's head. (He wasn't cited for the incident.)
The video didn't spell the end of Wausau's national attention this holiday season, though.
The Associated Press recently wrote a story about a potential end to the snowball ordinance. It was picked up by newspapers like the Chicago Tribune, which published it Monday, and the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
Last month, the New York Times published its own story about the snowball ordinance and the police department's video, making Wausau a national Christmas story.
The law on snowballs is a small part of a larger ordinance that bans people from throwing objects such as stones, arrows and yes, even snowballs, on city-owned property.
Lisa Rasmussen, City Council president, told the Associated Press it was time to reconsider the ordinance because of recent negative national attention.
Those stories included inaccurate details, such as suggesting the ordinance was recently adopted. It's actually from 1962, Barnes said.
Not to mention that the ban on snowball fights is rarely enforced. Police have written citations under the ordinance only about 10 times in the last 15 years, Barnes said.
Wausau's ordinance drew national attention after WASW-TV published a story the day before Thanksgiving. It got picked up by national outlets that wrote "factually inaccurate" articles, Barnes said.
This is not the first time the city's snowball ordinance has garnered national attention. The ordinance was mentioned on a travel blog and legal website in 2016.
Here's the full text of Wausau ordinance 9.08.020 "No person shall throw or shoot any object, arrow, stone, snowball or other missile or projectile, by hand or by any other means, at any other person or at, in or into any building, street, sidewalk, alley, highway, park, playground or other public place within the city. This subsection shall not apply to archery ranges under the supervision of the park and recreation committee, nor shall it apply to the bow hunting provisions within 9.08.010."

How Tallahassee lit up TV in 2019

Texto completo: National TV watchers got to know Tallahassee pretty well in 2019, especially audiences into live police and firefighter shows on A&E.
A couple of our neighbors got their few minutes of fame, kicking butt on "Jeopardy!" or buying a house. And one sang his way into million of hearts – including Gwen Stefani's – and got pretty darned far on "The Voice."
We had the requisite winners and losers on the major awards shows, plus the seemingly annual "true crime story."
Here's a look back at some of the things we watched our fellow Tallahasseeans doing on television this year.
January: FSU Film School grads get nominated for more Oscars Barry Jenkins, the 2003 graduate of the FSU Film School — who was already an Academy Award- and Golden Globe-winning screenwriter and director – was nominated for an Oscar for "If Beale Street Could Talk."
Jenkins, who wrote and directed the film, was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, but in on Oscar night lost to the team who wrote "BlacKkKlansman."
(We think Jenkins is doing OK, though. In July, the website IndieWire named Jenkins' earlier Best Picture Oscar winner "Moonlight" the Best Movie of the Decade.)
But FSU did have at least one winner this year at the Oscars. Jonathan King ('92) was executive producer of "Roma," which was nominated for Best Picture, and "Green Book," which won. "Green Book" happens to have another local connection. One of the hotels listed in the real "Green Book" was in Thomasville, Georgia. An effort is underway to restore the building.
February: The internet rumor mill turns to T-Pain It started with a whisper. Near the end of the first season of the new "reality" competition show, "The Masked Singer," the internet started to believe the show's clues pointed to the character of "The Monster" being Tallahassee's own T-Pain.
In case you missed the phenomenon, "The Masked Singer" dresses up celebrities as colorful characters in giant Disney-style costumes while they compete a la "American Idol." But the producers take all kinds of pains to make sure the audience can't recognize the famous voices.
Not only did the fans turn out to be right — The Monster was indeed T-Pain — but he won the whole competition! He turned a lot of heads who'd written him off as "just a rapper," too.
T-Pain released a new album, "1UP," carefully coordinated with the season finale, and launched a national tour. He's been performing his monster heart out, hosting the "2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards" and even dropping in as a guest star on the first episode of Season 2 of the "The Masked Singer."
February: FSU athletic trainer pops ups on HGTV Amanda Robinson, a Florida State athletic trainer with the men's basketball team, appeared on an episode of HGTV's "House Hunters" that was shot in Tallahassee.
What began with filling out a casting call on a late-night whim ended up as an episode titled "Like Mother Unlike Daughter in Tallahassee." (Yes, her mother appeared with her on the show. Really.)
Robinson ended up (spoiler alert) buying a house, but the process had its mishaps and is an entertaining watch — especially if you've ever made a major purchase with your mother.
September: FSU grad student competes on 'Jeopardy' In September, Laurel Lathrop, a Ph.D. candidate in creative writing at Florida State, was a contestant on "Jeopardy!" for three days.
Lathrop, 33, said she knew that her strongest subjects would be literature, history and art, with sports and geography as the categories she hoped to avoid.
She ended up winning about $64,000 in the first two days, and lost the third on the Final Jeopardy answer: "A chain of volcanoes is named for this mountain range where the continental USA's deadliest eruption took place."
Lathrop guessed "What are the Olympians?" but the correct question was "What are the Cascades?"
Damn that geography category!
September: TPD and TFD go live The Tallahassee Police Department opened its doors to A&E's cameras for a bunch of episodes of "Live PD," billed as "a real live look at police across the country as they work the night shift in real-time."
The show is three hours long, following police officers in several cities per episode — and it's pretty much what you'd imagine. Some of it's reasonably exciting TV; some is dull. There are lots of traffic stops, yelling, blurred faces and 'splaining.
The Dec. 6 episode was recapped by robertjonathan.com — a fan with a blog — like this: "Tallahassee, Fla. — Officers respond to report that vehicle drove into canal. Turns out it's just a stuck vehicle adjacent to the canal but not in it."
Tallahassee Fire Department also welcomed A&E's cameras for the companion series, "Live+Rescue," which follows firefighters, paramedics and EMTs.
Whether either show is your entertainment cup of tea, they are rare glimpses into what might be going on just a few blocks away from us as we sleep.
September: Tony Hale loses an Emmy but gains a Netflix show All eyes were on the Emmy Awards to see if Tallahassee's Tony Hale could bring home a third Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series award for playing the brow-beaten Gary Walsh on HBO's hit "Veep."
Alas, Hale lost to Tony Shalhoub for "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel."
"Veep" is over, so there won't be any other Emmys for Hale for playing Julia Louis-Dreyfus' long-suffering assistant. But Season 1 of Hale's newest project, "Archibald's Next Big Thing" — in which he writes and does the voice of an optimistic chicken who gets into a series of misadventures — began streaming on Netflix in 2019, so who knows what could be in his future?
Hale is also the voice of the new character Forky in "Toy Story 4," and became so popular that Disney created a series of shorts for Forky on its new Disney+ service. "Forky Asks a Question" covers important topics like "What Is Time?," "What Is a Pet?," "What Is Art?" and, of course, "What Is Love?"
September: Royce Lovett hits it big on "The Voice" Tallahassee was transfixed when local musician Royce Lovett's blind audition secured him a spot on Team Gwen (Stefani) on Season 17 of the reality TV show "The Voice."
Lovett, 30, a popular fixture on the Tallahassee music scene, easily won his first battle round when he was paired up with a 22-year-old Las Vegas native to sing a Bob Marley duet.
"Your voice is so animated," Stefani said about it. "You can feel the undertone of the reggae, but then you're bringing it to this modern place, this rock place. I love that."
Sadly, Lovett was eliminated in the knockout round. Ah well.
October: Dan Markel case is back in prime time ABC's news magazine "20/20" aired a new — or rather, updated — look at the murder of former FSU law professor Dan Markel. It aired the evening of the same day Sigfredo Garcia was found guilty of Markel's murder by a Leon County jury.
Originally shown Sept. 16, 2016, the new episode was titled "Over My Dead Body." It featured USA TODAY investigations editor (and former Tallahassee Democrat news director) Jennifer Portman and reporter Karl Etters, as well as prosecutor Georgia Cappleman and an attorney for Charlie Adelson, brother of Markel's ex-wife Wendi Adelson.
COMING SOON LCSO K-9s get their 15 minutes Three officers from the Leon County Sheriff's Office along with their K-9 partners will show off their speed and agility on A&E's new reality series "America's Top Dog." The first pair, Officer Casey Skelton and his partner Maverick, are set to appear on the show's premiere at 9 p.m. Wednesday.
Local author Jeff VanderMeer gets AMC series Tallahassee author and New York Times bestseller Jeff VanderMeer's work has already been adapted for the big screen in the feature film "Annihilation" starring Natalie Portman.
Now his "Borne"-universe series, which includes the recently-published "Dead Astronauts" (Midtown Reader usually has signed copies for sale) has been optioned for the small screen by AMC.
VanderMeer will be directly involved as an executive producer and creative consultant on the project, likely a TV series. Maybe Tallahassee will be the home of the next "Game of Thrones"?

How Boeing is Moving Forward in 2020

Texto completo: In 2019, Boeing, the American based company which designs and manufactures airplanes experienced some rough times.
In October 2018, one of its planes, a Boeing 737 MAX was leaving Indonesia when it crashed shortly after take-off. It killed 189 people. The following year in March another Boeing 737 MAX being flown by Ethiopian Airlines crashed and killed all 157 people on board.
After the second crash the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) called upon the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to temporarily ground any 737 MAX that was scheduled to leave the U.S.
In the official statement, Sara Nelson, the AFA president, said the decision was based on public confidence in the safety of air travel. The United States has the safest aviation system in the world, Nelson said, but the FAA should be a leader and restore public faith in the system.
When similarities were drawn between the two crashes, the AFA called for an investigation into the 737 MAX.
“…in the wake of a second accident, regulators, manufactures and airlines must take steps to address concerns immediately,” Nelson said in a statement. “AFA is formally requesting the FAA conduct an investigation into the 737 MAX.”
The New York Times reported that investigators found problems with how parts of the 737 MAX were designed and certified. The Times found that an automated system known as MCAS was at the center of both crashes. MCAS was reportedly new to the plane but pilots were unaware.
The Times continued that the Joint Authorities Technical Review found that Boeing failed to explain how MCAS function.
NPR said that the MCAS overrode the pilots’ controls and forced the planes to take a nosedive.
Due to the decision to ground flights, several major airlines demanded compensation from Boeing.
CNBC reported that American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, Turkish Air and others requested compensation, but since 737 MAX planes were still grounded it would be hard to determine how much each airline would receive.
As of October 2019, the FAA continues to ground all 737 MAX planes. In a statement released Oct. 25, 2019, the FAA said, “the aircraft will return to service only after the FAA determines it is safe.”
According to the AFA, the FAA announced that it will require Boeing to update the design on the plane.
As part of its plan to restore confidence, Dennis Muilenburg, Boeing’s CEO stepped down. Muilenburg had joined Boeing in 1985, according to his Boeing bio. He served as president from December 2013 to December 2019 and CEO from July 2015 to December 2019.
Muilenburg will officially by replaced by Dave Calhoun, who also replaced Muilenburg as chairman of the board. CNN Business reported that the company originally maintained its confidence in Muilenburg, but a series of missteps finalized the decision to remove him from the company.
The mistakes included Muilenburg’s initial reaction to the problem and missing deadlines.
While it’s easy to analyze the crashes themselves, the biggest loss is the lives of those who died during the crashes.
In December 2019, NPR spoke with Michael Stumo who lost his daughter Samya on the Ethiopian Airlines flight. Stumo said that Boeing’s decision to fire Muilenburg was a step in the right direction and that more resignations are needed.
During the interview Stumo criticized the board and said the company shifted its focus to business executives and making profits over engineers and safety. He said that now the world has seen what happens when Boeing self-regulates.
While the future of Boeing is still uncertain the company is making conscious efforts to restore the confidence of travelers worldwide.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A barometer, said a wit, is an ingenious instrument that reveals the weather we are experiencing. Presidential campaigns often are political barometers. They can, however, change the social climate. The Democratic presidential aspirants, plucking at the electorate’s sleeve, are perhaps inadvertently getting the country interested in moderation.
Many of them spent 2019 detailing how they would wield government as a scalpel to surgically remove America’s blemishes. Inconveniently, but without inhibiting these aspirants, the year ended with a cascade of discouraging headlines about the scalpel: “At war with the truth: How officials put their spin on 18 years of [Afghanistan] setbacks” (Washington Post), “Inspector Accuses FBI Of ‘Gross Incompetence’ in Handling Wiretap” (New York Times), “FAA Knew Boeing’s 737 Max Was Risky But Allowed Flights” (Wall Street Journal). Etc.
As 2020 begins, voters who say that their overriding objective is to remove the current president should wonder: Is it wise to hitch their wagons to any candidate whose agenda radiates, and requires, extravagant confidence in government’s ability to radically rearrange America’s most complex processes, from the allocation of economic resources to the provision of health care?
There is discouraging news for Donald Trump, which means encouraging news for the republic: Sen. Bernie Sanders is showing remarkable resilience, coronary and political, after his October “myocardial infarction.” This is encouraging not because the nation should swap one form of economic illiteracy for another, replacing a florid, angry protectionist with a florid, angry socialist. Rather, it is encouraging because Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren continue to divide, more or less evenly, the “let’s give government lots more to do” constituency. The longer this balance persists, the more time normal — meaning not very agitated or attentive — voters have to rally ‘round candidates who do not make prudent people wince.
Now-former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose rise has been this political season’s most interesting development, might have the political magic of allowing different voters to see different things in him. This recalls Hamlet having fun with Polonius:
Hamlet: Do you see yonder cloud that’s almost in shape of a camel?
Polonius: ... ‘tis like a camel, indeed.
Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel.
Polonius: It is backed like a weasel.
Hamlet: Or like a whale?
Polonius: Very like a whale.
The Democrats’ nominee might be apparent late in the evening of March 3, “Super Tuesday,” when 14 states allocate about 34% of the delegates to the nominating convention. By that evening, Michael Bloomberg will have learned, to his delight or sorrow, whether political spending is as potent as campaign reform scolds believe, or whether there is a steeply declining utility of the last millions of political spending.
If the nominee will be known that evening, we are already in at least the seventh inning of the nomination game. But the top of the first inning can matter a lot.
In early December 2011, polls indicated that former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, then seeking the Republican presidential nomination, was at 3% in polls anticipating the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses. Granted, the vagaries of Iowa’s caucuses — typically long evening gatherings during a Midwest winter — make predictive polling difficult. Still, Santorum’s support was negligible four weeks before he won with 24.6%. His wafer-thin victory was not confirmed until Jan. 20. If he rather than Mitt Romney had been announced the winner on caucus night, the subsequent competition might have developed differently.
So, it is still possible that someone — Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, someone — might yet surge. Remember, as a song in “The Music Man,” which is set in Iowa, says, Iowans can be “contrary.” They might want to play “cheat the prophet,” as G.K. Chesterton described this game in “The Napoleon of Notting Hill”: People listen respectfully as experts explain the inevitable, then mischievously cause something else to happen.
Fortunately for those who seek entertaining surprises from politics, political science is a science of single instances, which means it is not much of a science. And fortunately for those who think today’s political fare is too highly seasoned, perhaps there is a market for something milder.
In Peter De Vries’ novel “I Hear America Swinging,” about the sexual revolution arriving in Iowa, the protagonist is invited to an orgy where he is nicknamed “Vanilla” because of his adherence to the sexually mundane. Perhaps in this year’s politics, as in ice cream year after year, the most popular flavor will be vanilla.

Texto completo: Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani’s ability to travel as he pleased in much of the Middle East likely contributed to his death.
Soleimani, the Iranian general responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members, was killed by a drone strike on Thursday while driving between the city Baghdad and the airport. While some could question why Soleimani felt confident enough to travel days after helping coordinate an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq, it wasn’t unusual for him to travel at will, according to the New York Times.
Marc Polymeropoulos, a retired senior CIA operations officer said, “Soleimani was treated like royalty, and was not particularly hard to find. Soleimani absolutely felt untouchable, particularly in Iraq. He took selfies of himself on the battlefield and openly taunted the U.S. because he felt safe in doing so.”
[Click here for more Soleimani coverage]
Both President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama followed Soleimani’s moves via drone for years. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a retired Army general who led Joint Special Operations Command in the mid-2000s, recalled following Solemiani’s movements with a clear opportunity to strike but opted not to because of potential backlash.
“To avoid a firefight, and the contentious politics that would follow, I decided that we should monitor the caravan, not strike immediately,” McChrystal said while recalling the moment.
McChrystal was hesitant to make the move himself, though he lauded Trump’s decision. He warned there could be retaliation, stating, “The targeting was appropriate given Soleimani’s very public role in orchestrating Iranian attacks on the U.S. and our allies. We can’t consider this as an isolated action. As with all such actions, it will impact the dynamics of the region, and Iran will likely feel compelled to respond in kind.”
Soleimani’s death came amid heightened tensions following the death of an American contractor and an attack on the U.S. Embassy. Secretary of State Pompeo explained that the decision to kill the general was tied to “imminent” plans for an attack on American personnel.

Tom Steyer spends almost $100 million on ads but people still confuse him with Steve Bullock

Texto completo: A new survey found that people are mistaking 2020 Democratic presidential contender Tom Steyer for some of his competitors, despite hefty ad buys by the candidate.
The New York Times released Friday the results of a quiz asking readers to identify different celebrities and political figures. The survey found that only 8% of people could properly identify Gov. Steve Bullock. Of the 92% of people who answered incorrectly, 28% of them thought the former presidential contender was really Steyer.
Steyer, 62, was also mistaken for Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and former Maryland Rep. John Delaney. Only 16% of respondents knew who Bennet was, and 15% of the people who did not know who he was guessed that he was Steyer. Roughly equal amounts of people properly guessed Delaney when presented with a picture of him as guessed that it was Steyer.
The confusion follows the California Democrat spending $83 million on ads for his Democratic presidential bid. The amount is more than any other candidate in the field other than former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Steyer is currently polling in 10th place in the Democratic primary, at less than 2%, according to RealClearPolitics.

Liberals want racial quotas in their 2020 presidential primary

Texto completo: It’s a timeworn dictum of liberals that affirmative action is not, I repeat, is not the same thing as racial quotas. And yet, here we are: Just weeks before the first contest in the Democratic presidential primary, and liberals are steamed that they didn’t demand their party explicitly reserve spaces for minorities on the debate stages so that they would have a better shot at the nomination.
Liberal Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote Thursday about the sad “whites only” message his party is sending by setting up rules that have, according to him, “prematurely” weeded out the less popular minority candidates. “As a result,” he wrote, “the Democrats’ greatest electoral strength — diversity — likely will not be on display. ‘Whites only’ is not a look the party should want.”
He offered no solutions to this apparent problem other than to simply allow more spots open on the debate stage. He would not suggest such a thing if, say, Julian Castro (Latino) had made the cut and Pete Buttigieg (white) had not. Neither Robinson nor any other liberal got upset early last month when Montana Governor Steve Bullock (white) ended his campaign for the nomination.
There is literally nothing the party can do to ensure more “diversity” to endure on the primary debate stages than to enact a candidate quota system that takes the power to determine debate participation away from donors and voters. Robinson doesn’t want to say that out loud. No liberal does, though David Leonhardt at the New York Times came closest.
“It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots,” he wrote last weekend. “Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.”
That’s a quota — not by race, but I wonder who Leonhardt had in mind when he suggested a reservation for a senator “from a large state?”
The fact is that the minority candidates, among them Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Andrew Yang, and Deval Patrick, weren’t popular enough within the party’s own voters and in particular with its nonwhite voters. Black voters seem to prefer Joe Biden. Latino voters like Bernie Sanders. (And the racially fluid feel an inexplicable bond with Elizabeth Warren.)
Liberals who insist there’s something wrong with their own party reducing the debate stage to only white candidates should just admit it: They want racial quotas.

Death of Qassem Soleimani inspires predictably stupid behavior from media

Texto completo: The killing of Iranian Quds Force leader and terrorist mastermind Qassem Soleimani has inspired some great work by the members of the national press.

It has also inspired some breathtakingly stupid reactions.

CNN, for example, alerted its more than 3 million followers on Twitter Friday afternoon with a headline that reads, “President Trump dined on ice cream as news of the airstrike broke.”

I promise you this is a real headline published by a real news organization. If you can believe it, the accompanying report is even dumber than the news alert.
Tweet

“As news broke that the US struck and killed Qasem Soleimani, President Trump was dining at his Mar-a-Lago club, surrounded by old friends and others like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy,” reads the opening portion to CNN’s live updates. “As meatloaf and ice cream were served, the Pentagon confirmed that the US was behind the strikes, the only statement from the administration throughout the night.”

In other words, the president ate dinner long after the U.S. operation to take out Soleimani had taken place. CNN is reporting that the president had dinner at the same time that reporters learned of the Iranian general’s targeted killing. News you can use.

Amazingly, the CNN update continues, adding that the “scene Friday was similar to the one after Trump gave the order for American forces to carry out the missile strike on a Syrian airfield in the spring 2017.” It goes on:
After that strike, Trump went into great detail about the chocolate cake he had with Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was there for ga [sic] summit, when he informed him about the series of tomahawk missiles. "I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you — this was during dessert,” Trump said at the time. “We’ve just fired 59 missiles, all of which hit, by the way, unbelievable, from, you know, hundreds of miles away, all of which hit, amazing. Brilliant. It’s so incredible. It’s brilliant. It’s genius.” "He was eating his cake and he was silent," the President added. Trump later described it as "the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you’ve ever seen—and President Xi was enjoying it.”
Then, there is CNN reporter Jim Acosta, who tweeted an excerpt from President Trump's remarks Friday on Soleimani's death followed by his own uniquely vapid brand of analysis: "Trump: 'We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.’ (Not how the Iranians see this)."

Jim Acosta, Iran whisperer.
Tweet
This is not the behavior of a serious newsroom. This is the behavior of an activist group with press credentials.

Over at the Washington Post, things were slightly less embarrassing.

“Breaking news: Airstrike at Baghdad airport kills Iran’s most revered military leader, Qasem Soleimani, Iraqi state television reports,” the Post reported in a breaking news headline.

I suppose “revered" is a step up from "austere religious scholar," but that is not saying much.

Maybe the Post's tweeted headline can be forgiven. Chalk it up to clumsy word choice. What is unforgivable, however, is that the accompanying report, titled “In major escalation, American strike kills top Iranian commander in Baghdad,” waits 16 whole paragraphs before mentioning anything about Soleimani’s terrorist activities. That is what we call burying the lede.
Tweet
Lastly, because it stands out as uniquely gross, there is New York Times reporter Farnaz Fassihi, who shared a video Friday morning seeking to humanize Soleimani.

“Rare personal video of Gen. Suleimani reciting poetry shared by a source in #Iran. About friends departing & him being left behind,” she tweeted.

The video indeed shows the late terrorist tyrant reciting poetry. How touching. I may weep.
Tweet
Fassihi said later after she caught plenty of well-deserved grief for her Soleimani-humanizing tweets: “Folks attacking me for sharing this video: It's called reporting. It's not an endorsement or sympathy. I share whatever info I get for all to see. That's all.”

Yes, and the Fuhrer was a terrific dancer. Not many people know that.

Texto completo: Every day in courtrooms across this country, intent is proven through words, actions, or some combination of both. Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz has testified that he could not establish that political bias motivated those at the heart of the FBI’s operation dubbed “Crossfire Hurricane,” the investigation into President Trump's 2016 campaign. The records of both Crossfire Hurricane and the Mueller investigation show, however, that the only logical inference to be drawn from the series of contrasting treatments of different targets, glaring omissions, false court submissions, and mysterious failures is that there was political bias at the top of the FBI.
That bias motivated key decisions in a way that violates all our notions of fundamental fairness, a shocking corruption of our law enforcement and counterintelligence processes.
The first piece of evidence of political bias lies in the disparate treatment during two of the most important investigations in FBI history. The first was “Midyear Exam,” which investigated whether Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, or anyone in her circle violated laws protecting the handling of classified national security material. The second was “Crossfire Hurricane,” which likewise implicated a presidential candidate and national security. The two cases originated very differently.
Midyear Exam began several months after the New York Times reported in March 2015 that Hillary Clinton conducted official government business not through government communications channels but on a previously secret private server. Horowitz’s subsequent review found that the FBI showed a "preference for consent over compulsory process to obtain evidence" when investigating Clinton.
Crossfire Hurricane began in nearly the opposite manner.
The mysterious Joseph Mifsud reportedly told George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, that Russia had “dirt” on Clinton. At the time, media reports speculated that Russia or China might have intercepted Clinton’s emails and possibly had the 30,000 emails her team deleted before they could be reviewed by the FBI.
Papadopoulos’s recounting of this rumor to an Australian diplomat at a bar was, supposedly, the foundation for opening a counterintelligence operation that would eventually include FISA warrants and confidential human sources all against Trump’s campaign and new administration. Yet this same rumor was already being discussed publicly.
Why, then, was the discussion of it by Papadopoulos at a bar sufficiently grave to form the basis of an extraordinary, and probably historically unprecedented, intrusion into the opposition party’s campaign for the presidency? The clear inference to be drawn in the glaring contrast in the treatment of two similarly situated targets is that of political animus — favoring Clinton over Trump.
The disparate investigative tactics between the two are nowhere starker than in the use of FISA warrants to surveil the Trump campaign through Carter Page, another foreign policy adviser to then-candidate Trump.
FBI official William Priestap opened Crossfire Hurricane at the end of July 2016. Days later, according to Horowitz, the FBI first notified the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, the branch that handles FISA warrants, that they were seeking a FISA warrant on Carter Page. The ink opening the investigation was barely dry — nothing of investigative significance had yet happened — and still, the FBI sought FISA surveillance, typically designed to surveil foreign terrorists and spies, of a Naval Academy graduate who was a member of the Trump presidential campaign.
This surveillance allows investigators to capture not only the historic electronic communications of the target, Page, but also those of persons with whom he had communicated. Since he was a member of the Trump campaign, investigators must have known that FISA warrants would give them access to high-level Trump campaign officials’ communications.
Contrast this early request for a FISA warrant against the softer approach taken toward investigating Clinton. This extraordinary difference in treatment leads to the inescapable conclusion that the team in charge of these investigations, which was the same in both matters, held a bias favoring Clinton over Trump and acted accordingly in their investigative decision-making.
During Crossfire Hurricane, the FBI used multiple confidential human sources (the FBI’s term for informants) to record conversations with Page, Papadopoulos, and another campaign official covertly. These recordings, according to Horowitz, did not result in incriminating information against any of them or any member of the Trump campaign. In fact, information illustrating that there was no conspiracy involving the campaign and Russia was elucidated.
This tactical use of informants against the opposition political party stands, once again, in contrast to the tactics used by the FBI in investigating the conduct of Clinton and her staff. Midyear Exam lasted approximately one year. But never, in all that time, did any FBI agent obtain covert recordings of anyone involved in the use of Clinton’s unsecured private server for the transmission and maintenance of national security information.
Nonetheless, Crossfire Hurricane remained open, though no evidence of a Trump-Russia conspiracy was found. Enter the Steele dossier. In what must surely be a historic irony, Clinton and others hired a foreign national, Christopher Steele, to dig up dirt on Trump. Steele supposedly obtained what we now know to be thoroughly debunked allegations detailing a “well-developed conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians” from Russian sources.
The Crossfire Hurricane team made haste back to the Department of Justice and the FISA Court. Discussions at the FBI began on Sept. 19, 2016, regarding whether the Steele reporting was sufficient to go back to DOJ and request a FISA on Page. A formal request for a FISA warrant was sent to DOJ just days later. At no time did the FBI tell DOJ attorneys drafting the FISA application that covert recordings of Page and Papadopoulos existed and that both men specifically denied the kind of Russian conspiracy or connections between themselves, the campaign, and Russia that Steele reported.
Finally, the FBI failed to disclose that Clinton was the source of funds for the Steele dossier.
Despite the gravity of seeking a warrant against an American citizen working for the opposition party, the FBI further requested that the application be expedited on Sept. 30, just five short weeks before the election. Why would the FBI fail to disclose to the Justice Department, and subsequently to the FISA Court, all of that exculpatory information that tended to discredit Steele’s dossier?
It is not credible to attribute these omissions to mere mistakes. Rather, these glaring omissions highlight the animus against Trump’s campaign that seems to have motivated the Crossfire Hurricane team.
All of which brings us to the mysterious failures of the man touted by the establishment wings of both parties as an unassailable investigative virtuoso, Robert Mueller. James Comey, in another act that shows his own political bias, leaked to the media information about Crossfire Hurricane in retaliation for being fired just so a special counsel would be appointed.
In May 2017, when he was fired, Comey surely knew after months of FISA recordings from Page that neither Page nor anyone with whom he communicated was conspiring with or was an agent of Russia. He also must have known his own team had discredited the dossier at the heart of the Page FISA warrant. He also had to know of the utter lack of incriminating evidence in the covert recordings and his and Peter Strzok’s secret intelligence gathering briefings.
Why, then, did Comey feel the need to force the appointment of a special counsel to investigate allegations? If presented with these facts, a jury would surely find his intent was either political animus or petty revenge. Either one is a disgrace.
How did Mueller likewise miss the glaring errors and misconduct in his investigation that the inspector general found so easily? We know from Horowitz that, after the election of Trump, the FBI moved quickly to try and shore up the Steele dossier. In November and December 2016, they contacted Steele’s sources, who denied and contradicted his claims that there was a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia. Thus, Mueller the virtuoso investigator failed to discover in a two-year, multimillion-dollar investigation that the sum total of Trump-Russia conspiracy allegations only ever existed in the Steele dossier, which was wholly discredited before Trump even took the oath of office.
Mueller had access to the entire Crossfire Hurricane team; its covert recordings of Page, Papadopoulos, and the other campaign official; Strzok's and Comey’s notes on their secret intelligence-gathering briefings; and the Steele dossier funding source and verification failures. Still, he persisted.
Political animus against Trump is the only verdict that speaks the truth.

Texto completo: Attendees at an "Evangelicals for Trump" campaign event booed members of the press that came to cover the president's address.
President Trump spoke to a crowd of supportive churchgoers on Friday evening at the Miami-based megachurch King Jesus International Ministry. After the event concluded, attendees booed as reporters began leaving the church, according to Maggie Haberman of the New York Times.

Trump often criticizes the press for how it covers his administration, and his lines on the topic at rallies receive raucous applause from his supporters.

Trump’s rally to bolster his support among evangelicals comes after Christianity Today, an evangelical magazine founded by Rev. Billy Graham, said the president should be removed from office in December. Graham died Feb. 21, 2018, at the age of 99.
The president thanked Graham’s 67-year-old son Franklin for his continued support of the administration at the event. Franklin Graham had slammed the Christianity Today editorial against Trump, saying his father would not have supported it.
Trump has enjoyed high levels of support from the evangelical community and will likely keep that support, despite the attack from the evangelical magazine.

Texto completo: President Trump warned members of his evangelical base that every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate poses a threat to their religious liberty.
"Our faith is needed now more than ever," Trump said during a Friday "Evangelicals for Trump" rally in Miami. "While certain fads come and go, it's an eternal truth that faith and family lead to the stability, happiness, and prosperity of nations."
"Yet as we speak," Trump continued, "every Democrat candidate running for president is trying to punish religious believers and silence our churches and our pastors.”
[Related: 'I think we're very close': Freed Pastor Andrew Brunson urges young American Christians to prepare for persecution]
The assertion met with boos from the audience, who came to hear his hourlong speech at the mostly Hispanic church, Ministerio Internacional El Rey Jesus. "We can smile because we're winning by so much," Trump encouraged them.
"Our opponents want to shut out God from the public square so that they can impose their extreme anti-religious and socialist agenda on America," Trump continued. The New York Times reported that "many supporters outside [the rally] were Cuban émigrés who said their primary concern was what they saw as the threat of socialism. Most said they were lifelong Republicans who were more concerned than ever about the Democratic Party gaining more power, citing fears that they would face more government mandates."

Trump went on to mock former 2020 Democratic candidate Beto O'Rourke, who called last summer for churches to be stripped of their tax-exempt status if they do not support gay marriage. He urged his evangelical supporters "to mobilize Christian communities across our land" to vote in such a way that would ensure "another monumental victory for faith and family, God and country, flag and freedom."
Trump is not the only prominent Republican warning that the Democratic Party increasingly poses a threat to people of faith, especially evangelical Christians. Drawing from an interview that persecuted Pastor Andrew Brunson did with the Washington Examiner, Republican North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis wrote in October that the policies many Democrats are pushing present "a chilling attempt to subvert the constitutional rights of Americans of faith in order to social-engineer our places of worship."

The clearest sign yet that the Warren campaign is dead in the water

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2020 Democratic primary candidacy is toast.

The Massachusetts lawmaker's fundraising woes are evident, as is her collapse in the polls.

What many people probably have not noticed, however, is that she is also quietly trying to bury her signature domestic policy proposal: "Medicare for all," an absurd multitrillion-dollar program that would require funding not even she can explain.

“Warren herself is barely speaking of the proposal,” the New York Times reported this week in an article titled, “Elizabeth Warren isn’t talking much about ‘medicare for all’ anymore.”

“After months of attacks from other candidates, and questions and some blowback from both liberals and moderates," the New York Times reports, "[Medicare for all] is just a passing mention in her standard stump speech, rarely explored in depth unless a questioner brings it up."

This is not the behavior of a campaign confident of winning the nomination. This is the behavior of a campaign so desperate as to shelve its key policy proposal.

"Medicare for all" has arguably done more damage to Warren's polling and credibility than any other falsehood she has told, including the one about her supposed Native American heritage. After all, Warren's numbers took a nosedive right after she released her "Medicare for all" plan and an absurd policy paper explaining how she plans to “fund” it. Her polling continued to hemorrhage when she declined during subsequent Democratic debates to address the specifics.
Warren's campaign clearly believes her healthcare proposal is poison. But it is equally poisonous to pretend it doesn't exist. Warren is supposed to be the fearless ideas candidate — she persists, and she has a plan for everything. Her actions now suggest otherwise.

Rather than promote her signature healthcare proposal in the weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Warren is focusing instead on a broader, generic message of fighting corruption in Washington. Amusingly, her aides claim that this was always her focus.

“Her campaign aides insist that fighting corruption has always been the message, and Ms. Warren has long argued that, more than any individual proposal, her suite of plans is rooted in an overarching vision of changing how Washington works, including reforms in campaign finance and lobbying,” the New York Times report reads.

Down the memory hole with all those big ideas. Gone now is the candidate who was roundly applauded during the first debate for scolding former Maryland Congressman John Delaney for his moderation: “I don’t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for the president of the United States just to talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t fight for. I don’t get it.”
The truth of it, the New York Times reports, is that “Ms. Warren has not become fully comfortable with staking her candidacy on her plan for health care, even as many Democrats cite the issue as their top priority.”
The Warren campaign is near its end. You don’t shelve your key policy proposal because you are confident of victory.

'Ethical naivete': Christianity Today editor claims 'widespread ignorance' behind evangelical Trump support

Texto completo: The editor in chief of Christianity Today, who stoked furor among evangelicals for demanding President Trump's removal from office last month, blasted Christians who support Trump as ignorant.
"I’ve been surprised by the ethical naivete of the response I’m receiving to the editorial," Mark Galli, 67, told the New York Times in an interview published Thursday. "There does seem to be widespread ignorance — that is the best word I can come up with — of the gravity of Trump’s moral failings. Some evangelicals will acknowledge he had a problem with adultery, but now they consider that a thing of the past."
Galli offered the example of Israelite King David's adultery recounted in the Old Testament, but he clarified, "[Evangelical Trump supporters] bring up King David, but the difference is King David repented! Donald Trump has not done that."
"Some evangelicals say he is prideful, abrasive and arrogant, which are all the qualities that Christians decry, but they don’t seem to grasp how serious it is for a head of state to talk like that, and it does make me wonder what’s going on there," Galli continued.
[Opinion: Growing number of 'exvangelicals' and nonreligious millennials will have dire political consequences]
Galli's sentiments echo those expressed in his Dec. 19 editorial for Christianity Today, in which he characterized Trump's July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president as "profoundly immoral." He further lambasted the president as "a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused" and called for him to be removed. Galli revealed to the New York Times that the traffic to his piece crashed the site and caused his phone to ring "all day."
The article was met with strong rebuke not just from the president but from many prominent evangelicals, including 67-year-old evangelist Franklin Graham, whose father, Rev. Billy Graham, started the flagship Christian magazine in 1956. "Yes, my father Billy Graham founded Christianity Today," Graham wrote, "but no, he would not agree with their opinion piece. In fact, he would be very disappointed."

The editor of the Christian Post resigned in protest after his publication issued a Dec. 23 editorial countering Christianity Today, in which Galli is quoted as saying, “I know hardly anyone, let alone any evangelical Christian who voted for Trump."
Galli went on to describe "evangelicals like me" as "elite evangelicals" and described the evangelicals who support Trump as "aliens in our midst." He added that "these other evangelicals often haven’t finished college, and if they have jobs (and apparently a lot of them don’t), they are blue-collar jobs or entry-level work ... They are deeply suspicious of mainstream media. A lot of them voted for Donald Trump.”
Author and radio show host Eric Metaxas, 57, who was among the nearly 200 prominent evangelicals who signed a letter rebuking Christianity Today for Galli's piece, told the Washington Examiner: "The cultural elite, including the cultural elites in the evangelical world, see themselves boxed out of the equation to some extent, and that is why they're so angry. Most Americans are so fed up with political correctness, for example, that when anyone opposes it, they cheer — even if that person has what they would think of as flaws."
Explaining what he believes is Trump's appeal, Metaxas said, "He has understood that the elites have dramatically ceased to speak for the common man in America, whether that common man is an evangelical or not. And I think that folks like the editors of the New York Times and some of the editors at Christianity Today and others like that see themselves being pushed out of any real conversation."

Texto completo: Sen. Mitt Romney — who heads a Senate foreign relations subcommittee on the Middle East — praised the U.S. strike Friday that killed a top Iranian general but also called on the Trump administration to articulate “a coherent strategy for protecting our security interests” there.
Meanwhile, Utah’s only Democrat in Congress, Rep. Ben McAdams, said he, too, wants to see a coherent strategy and vowed, "I will not put American soldiers in harm’s way without a clear plan and unless the risk is warranted.”
Romney, R-Utah, said, “Qassem Soleimani was a depraved terrorist who had the blood of hundreds of American servicemen and women on his hands, and who was doubtlessly planning operations to further harm our citizens and allies. We remember and honor the sacrifice of those servicemen and women, and we commend our brave troops and intel officers who carried out this successful mission."
Soleimani was commander of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and was the architect of its interventions across the Middle East. He was killed in a drone strike early Friday that was approved by President Donald Trump, the Pentagon said.
Romney also said that in a time of increasing tension in the region, the United States must take necessary steps to protect its interests and personnel there.
“With ever-increasing challenges confronting us in the Middle East, it is imperative that the U.S. and our allies articulate and pursue a coherent strategy for protecting our security interests in the region,” Romney said. “I will be pressing the administration for additional details in the days ahead.”
McAdams gave a mixture of praise and concern in his statement.

“A terrorist who plotted against and killed Americans has received justice,” he said. “I share Utahns’ concerns today about what this action means for our men and women in the military who put their lives on the line to defend America and our freedom. Our reaction as a country must be to come together, not as Republicans and Democrats, but as Americans.”
He added that he will be analyzing the information and intelligence regarding the evolving situation and asking questions about the strategy. “We must ensure there is a coherent and long-term strategy to protect the United States and to protect freedom abroad,” he said. "I will not put American soldiers in harm’s way without a clear plan and unless the risk is warranted.”
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, issued a short statement. “The death of Qassem Soleimani is a big victory for the safety of the American people. As always, I am anxious to learn about the legal justification for this action, and look forward to being briefed by the Pentagon and the White House.”
Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, tweeted out support for the strike, and also issued a warning for Iran to be careful in its next steps.
“I want to thank @POTUS for his decisive leadership as well as the brilliance of our intelligence & military forces,” Stewart tweeted. “Soleimani was a terrorist who was responsible for hundreds of American deaths & creating chaos & instability in the region. The world is a safer place without him.”

Stewart also issued this warning in a tweet: “Iran needs to be careful in their next step, for we will continue to be committed to defending American lives in the region.”
Rep. John Curtis, R-Utah, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, also praised the strike but sought more information from the administration.
“Qassem Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq and elsewhere; the State Department puts the official figure at 603. With reports of Soleimani actively plotting more attacks against the United States, the president acted decisively to protect countless lives including our service members, diplomats, and everyday citizens," he said in a statement. "I expect someone from the administration to brief myself and my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee as soon as possible.”
Rep. Rob Bishop, R-Utah and a member of the House Armed Services Committee, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A drone killed Soleimani as he was leaving Baghdad International Airport. It was launched after pro-Iranian demonstrators earlier this week marched on the U.S. Embassy, trapping personnel inside and destroying a reception area.
U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Matthew Tueller, who is from Utah, was out of the country on personal leave at the time of the embassy protests, according to the State Department.
Tueller is a career diplomat who previously served as ambassador to Yemen and to Kuwait. A graduate of Brigham Young University and Harvard, he speaks fluent Arabic.
During confirmation hearings last March, he talked about the pivotal role of Iraq in the region.
“Our relationship with Iraq remains a critical one for the national security interests of the United States," he testified. “However, let me stress from the outset that there will be no greater priority for me than the safety and security of all Americans residing in Iraq.”
Nationally, the strike sharply divided congressional leaders along party lines.
According to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the strike was carried out “without the consultation of Congress.”
“American leaders’ highest priority is to protect American lives and interests,” Pelosi said in a statement. “But we cannot put the lives of American service members, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions. Tonight’s airstrike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence.”
Another Democrat, Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico, accused Trump of bringing the nation “to the brink of an illegal war with Iran.”
The New York Times also reported that the decision to kill Soleimani was one that Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had rejected, fearing it would lead to war.

Texto completo: The past week’s images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated “fire tornadoes” powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
The thing is, Australia’s summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Notice that I said “related to” rather than “caused by” climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
In recent years, however, climate scientists have tried to cut through this confusion by engaging in “extreme event attribution,” which focuses on probabilities: You can’t necessarily say that climate change caused a particular heat wave, but you can ask how much difference global warming made to the probability of that heat wave happening. And the answer, typically, is a lot: Climate change makes the kinds of extreme weather events we’ve been seeing much more likely.
And while there’s a lot of randomness in weather outcomes, that randomness actually makes climate change much more damaging in its early stages than most people realize. On our current trajectory, Florida as a whole will eventually be swallowed by the sea, but long before that happens, rising sea levels will make catastrophic storm surges commonplace. Much of India will eventually become uninhabitable, but killing heat waves and droughts will take a deadly toll well before that point is reached.
Put it this way: While it will take generations for the full consequences of climate change to play out, there will be many localized, temporary disasters along the way. Apocalypse will become the new normal — and that’s happening right in front of our eyes.
The big question is whether the proliferation of climate-related disasters will finally be enough to break though the opposition to action.
There are some hopeful signs. One is that the news media has become much more willing to talk about the role of climate change in weather events.
Not long ago it was all too common to read articles about heat waves, floods and droughts that seemed to go to great lengths to avoid mentioning climate change. My sense is that reporters and editors have finally gotten over that block.
The public also seems to be paying attention, with concern about climate change growing substantially over the past few years.
The bad news is that growing climate awareness is mainly taking place among Democrats; the Republican base is largely unmoved.
And the anti-environmental extremism of conservative politicians has, if anything, become even more intense as their position has become intellectually untenable. The right used to pretend that there was a serious scientific dispute about the reality of global warming and its sources. Now Republicans, and the Trump administration in particular, have simply become hostile to science in general. Hey, aren’t scientists effectively part of the deep state?
Furthermore, this isn’t just a U.S. problem. Even as Australia burns, its current government is reaffirming its commitment to coal and threatening to make boycotts of environmentally destructive businesses a crime.
The sick irony of the current situation is that anti-environmentalism is getting more extreme precisely at the moment when the prospects for decisive action should be better than ever.
On one side, the dangers of climate change are no longer predictions about the future: We can see the damage now, although it’s only a small taste of the horrors that lie ahead.
On the other side, drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions now look remarkably easy to achieve, at least from an economic point of view. In particular, there has been so much technological progress in alternative energy that the Trump administration is trying desperately to prop up coal against competition from solar and wind.
So will environmental policy play a role in the 2020 campaign? Most Democrats seem disinclined to make it a major issue, and I understand why: Historically, the threat posed by right-wing environmental policy seemed abstract, distant and hard to run on compared with, say, Republican attempts to dismantle Obamacare.
But the wave of climate-related catastrophes may be changing the political calculus. I’m not a campaign expert, but it seems to me that campaigns might get some traction with ads showing recent fires and floods and pointing out that Donald Trump and his friends are doing everything they can to create more such disasters.
For the truth is that Trump’s environmental policy is the worst thing he’s doing to America and the world. And voters should know that.

The Oldest Copy of the First Illustrated Book Has Been Discovered in Egypt

Texto completo: It’s always exciting when some kind of human civilizational first is discovered or unearthed by experts, as evidenced by the thrill generated by a recent discovery of cave paintings, thought to be the earliest example of pictorial storytelling, which were uncovered Indonesia. Now, a new study covered this week by the New York Times reports that the oldest copy of the first illustrated book has been found in Egypt by researchers working under the direction of University of Leuven Egyptologist Harco Willems.
Called the Book of Two Ways, the extraordinary narrative told in the tome is about what happens to the soul after death. It’s been dated to be approximately 4,000 years old and at least 4 decades older than any of the other known copies, of which there are approximately two dozen. The text was discovered in a village on the eastern side of the Nile river after Willems’ decision in 2012 to reopen and study the contents of a burial shaft once looted and long abandoned. A detailed report of the findings were published in The Journal of Egyptian Archeology’s September edition.

The fragments of the text were discovered within a tomb, atop the coffin of a woman named Ankh. The cemetery in which the tomb was found is a necropolis and quarry called Deir el-Bersha. Ancient Egyptians have always been famously known for their extensive preoccupations with the afterlife, as evidenced by the text The Book of the Dead , which provides readers with incantations and instructions about how to successfully navigate an underworld ruled by the god Osiris and ultimately become a god themselves.
Conversely, Willems told the Times that The Book of Two Ways provides extensively lush and almost cheat code-like details that seek to further illustrate the very specific trials that departed souls will be encountering in the afterlife. Two Ways is apparently filled with descriptions of demons, the names of nefarious gatekeepers and the identifying monikers of important floorboards so that the dead may find easier passage on their perilous journeys. Furthermore, the illustrations within The Book of Two Ways also describe the two options that dead souls have for traversing the Underworld: by land or by water. There’s something enduringly optimistic about the Ancient Egyptian consensus on eternity—if one prepares sufficiently for every possible trial, immortal resurrection is achievable. If only life was as clearly navigable!

Texto completo: No siempre hay asientos disponibles y no todos los vagones tienen el mismo diseño, pero cuando hay la posibilidad de escoger, ¿cuál es su lugar favorito para sentarse en el Metro de Nueva York?
La simple pregunta fue planteada en Twitter por el usuario Gabe Bautista , quien la publicó poco antes de que terminara el año, la tarde del 31 de diciembre, con un foto de un vagón vacío en la línea D del Metro, de los que tienen asientos separados, algo que no existe en los más modernos. En otros, como los de la ruta corta S (42nd Street Shuttle) no hay sillas, todos viajan parados.
Bautista, quien se identifica en su cuenta como habitante de El Bronx (NYC) junto a una bandera dominicana , desató un debate que se volvió viral, incluyendo respuestas de políticos locales y nacionales.
“No suelo usar asientos cuando viajo porque son para pasajeros”, dijo Andy Byford, presidente de NYC Transit, en un comunicado. “En cuanto a elegir el mejor, es como pedirle a un padre que elija a su hijo favorito. Cada uno es especial a su manera. Me encanta que la gente esté iniciando la década de 2020 hablando de asientos en el Metro”.
Aunque él sólo tiene 302 seguidores, más de 4 millones de personas habían visto hasta ayer en la tarde el mensaje en Twitter de Bautista, estudiante universitario. Y hasta el diario The New York Times, el más grande del país, reseñó la informal encuesta.
“Simplemente muestra cuán grande y pequeño es que todos en Nueva York pueden relacionarse entre sí”, dijo Bautisa a ABC News.
Las respuestas de los usuarios van desde quienes prefieren estar cerca de la puerta para salir más rápido, hasta quienes justamente evitan ese asiento “porque alguien puede arrebatar algo e irse, porque cualquiera podría tomar su teléfono y salir corriendo”, agregó Bautista.
Corey Johnson , presidente del Concejo Municipal de NYC, puso un mensaje en su Twitter con la foto original del sondeo, señalando que sus asientos favoritos son todos.
Mientras el ex alcalde de NYC y candidato presidencial Michael Bloomberg , optó por decir que “siempre viajo de pie”, con una foto suya leyendo el periódico dentro del Metro. Curiosamente se le ve bloqueando una puerta del vagón, algo que se sugiere no hacer.

Texto completo: 'Becky Shaw'
Enough with the holiday eggnog. It's time for a big, icy highball of take-no-prisoners wit. "Becky Shaw" -- a Pulitzer finalist a decade ago -- centers on a quartet of two men and two women in their 30s. Recalling the social-climbing heroine of Thackeray's "Vanity Fair," Gina Gionfriddo's play was applauded by the New York Times as a "ferociously funny ... comedy of bad manners." Ellen Fenster directs Gremlin Theatre's staging, which features Olivia Wilusz, Logan Verdoorn, Chelsie Newhard, Kevin Fanshaw and Jodi Kellogg. (Runs Jan. 3-26. 7:30 p.m. Fri.-Sat. & next Thu.; 3 p.m. Sun., 550 Vandalia St., St. Paul, $25-$28; those under 30 can pay half their age. 1-888-718-4253 or gremlintheatre.org.)

Texto completo: United Kingdom December’s election saw a record number of women – 220 – elected to the House of Commons. That number tops the previous high of 208 women elected in 2017. Women now fill just over a third of the 650 seats in the House of Commons. Female candidates in the Conservative Party won 86 seats, the highest number in the party’s history. More than half of the members of Parliament in the Labour Party are women. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary and member of the Labour Party, is being mentioned as a candidate for the party’s leadership. (CNN)
Bougainville The collection of islands in the South Pacific, which passed a vote to become independent from Papua New Guinea, could become the world’s newest country. Almost 98% of those who voted in the referendum supported independence. “Now, at least psychologically, we feel liberated,” said John Momis, president of the regional autonomous government. The referendum was linked to a peace agreement, which ended a civil war between security forces in Papua New Guinea and separatists in 1998. The Bougainville islands have a total population of 300,000. With such a high percentage of the residents choosing to separate, Papua New Guinea will be under pressure to make the transition to independence happen. (The New York Times, BBC)
Sierra Leone West Africa’s top court, the Economic Community of West African States, ruled girls who are pregnant can attend regular school, revoking a ban adopted by Sierra Leone in 2015. The African continent has the highest teen pregnancy rates in the world, and 18 countries have similar bans against pregnant girls attending school. “This is a great victory and will set a strong precedent across Africa,” said Judy Gitau, whose group Equality Now, a women’s rights organization, brought the case. The ruling also stated that separate, part-time learning centers for pregnant girls are “discriminatory and a violation of the right to equal education.” (Reuters)
Saudi Arabia Men, women, and children will now be able to dine in the same section of restaurants, according to new rules introduced by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs. Until the rule change, restaurant patrons were generally separated by screens according to gender. “It’s a waste of money to open two sections for males and families because this segregation will do nothing when both sides meet outside the restaurant’s doors,” said Ruba Al-Harbi, a restaurant manager. The amendment was a part of 103 sweeping changes to various rules and regulations governing social behavior. The mayor of Mecca told Arab News the updated policy for restaurants will make life easier for both citizens and entrepreneurs. (Arab News, BBC)
India A project run by the human rights group ActionAid India to secure land rights for indigenous people in India has won a gold prize from World Habitat, an international charity focused on ensuring safe housing for all. Lower-caste tribal communities in India have faced repeated discrimination when claiming rights to land, despite existing laws to aid their efforts. The Koraga tribe and nine other indigenous communities in southern Karnataka state have been helped by ActionAid India, which began in 2000. In addition to securing land, the project has assisted almost 20,000 people in getting state grants to build homes. (Reuters)
Iceland Scientists have found a way to trap carbon dioxide in stone, an encouraging development for climate scientists looking to reduce emissions in the atmosphere. Sandra Ósk Snæbjörnsdóttir, a geoscientist at Carbfix, says porous basalt rock is the gold standard for CO2 injection. The process captures harmful carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and injects it into basalt, which contains metals that react with the C02 and essentially turn it into stone, enabling the embedded pollutants to be stored underground. The scientists at Carbfix are trying to scale up their processes to make a greater global impact. “We have the know-how,” says Ms. Snæbjörnsdóttir. “We can find big fields of basalt all over the world.” (NPR)

Texto completo: Trials of all kinds - civil, criminal, impeachment - are supposed to try to get at the truth of the matter at hand. Despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s effort to convert the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump into a mere test of party loyalty, new revelations since the House voted to impeach Trump call for a real trial including witness testimony and documentary evidence.
The House voted Dec. 18 to impeach on two counts, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Facts supporting both counts are clear. Trump withheld congressionally approved military aide for Ukraine and an official state visit for new Ukrainian Prsident Volodymyr Zelensky while insisting that Zelensky announce an investigation of a Trump political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Then, Trump clearly hindered Congress as it attempted to carry out its constitutional duty to investigate the president’s conduct.
In the ensuing weeks, The Washington Post and The New York Times, using emails among key administration officials, have reconstructed Trump’s decision to withhold the aid against the advice of the Pentagon, the State Department and national security advisers, and the scramble in the White House to concoct a rationale for that decision after it was revealed by whistleblower in the intelligence community.
More so than ever, it would be sham for McConnell to attempt to conduct a trial without testimony from key figures in the relevant events, especially former National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should continue to refrain from sending the passed articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial until McConnell agrees to a real trial. And, given the results of the newspapers’ continuing inquiries, Pelosi should continue the House investigations so that the public will know what actually happened, regardless of whether McConnell continues to promote a charade.

Texto completo: Former auto titan Carlos Ghosn, packed into a case typically used for concert audio equipment, was sneaked onto a private jet at an airport in Osaka, Japan, late Sunday, according to people familiar with the matter, in what has become one of the corporate world's most stunning cases of bail jumping.
His escape from Japan, where he was fighting charges of financial crime stemming from his time at the top of Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, was months in the making, according to people familiar with the matter, and was put in motion only after Mr. Ghosn became convinced that his trial, slated for later this year, could drag on for years.
Mr. Ghosn, who is 65 years old, has said he arranged his escape on his own, but he was accompanied on his flight from Osaka to Istanbul, these people said, by an expert in the art of clandestine getaways: Michael Taylor, a former Green Beret well-known in the small, tight world of private security contractors.
This account of his journey is based on interviews with people familiar with a Turkish probe of two planes used in the escape, photos that are part of that probe, and conversations with people familiar with Mr. Ghosn's thinking and the planning and execution of the escape. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ghosn declined to comment on how he left Japan.
As last year neared its end, Mr. Ghosn became increasingly distraught at the prospect of a drawn-out trial. He was living in a court-monitored house in Tokyo, with severe restrictions on contact with his family. While he was free to leave his home, he wasn't allowed to leave Japan.
Since his arrest in November 2018, he had challenged Japanese charges of financial wrongdoing, and vowed to fight them in court.
But following a pretrial hearing on Christmas Day that suggested a further delay in the trial's start, Mr. Ghosn decided to move to Plan B, according to people familiar with the matter.
The escape plan was under way by Saturday, Dec. 28, in Dubai. That was where, according to flight manifests and immigration records now part of the Turkish probe, Mr. Taylor and another man boarded a Bombardier Global Express private jet bound for Japan. Dubai was also where two large black cases were loaded for the red-eye flight. The plane arrived at Osaka's busiest airport at 10:16 a.m. local time Sunday, according to flight records.
Japan's Asahi newspaper, citing Japanese investigative sources, said surveillance footage showed Mr. Ghosn leaving his Tokyo house alone at 2:30 p.m. Sunday, wearing a hat and a surgical-style mask used widely in Japan to protect from germs. That would have been less than nine hours before his plane left Japan.
How he traveled the more than 300 miles to Osaka from Tokyo is still a mystery. It also hadn't been known previously how Mr. Ghosn was able to board the private jet as he was barred from leaving the country. Kenji Takanishi, a spokesman for the operator of Osaka's Kansai International Airport, said luggage for private planes goes through the same inspection as passengers' luggage for regular commercial jets. However, he said VIPs were sometimes exempted from such checks.
The container used to sneak Mr. Ghosn aboard had holes drilled at the bottom to ensure he could breathe, according to people familiar with the matter. It also had wheels, typical for such cases, making it easier to move around.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think Carlos Ghosn was right to flee Japanese justice? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Ghosn's flight to Istanbul left at 11:10 p.m. Sunday and was in the air for just over 12 hours, passing over Russia before descending to Ataturk airport, according to flight records. In addition to the passengers, the plane carried two pilots and a flight attendant, the people familiar with the Turkish probe said.
On the ground at Ataturk airport Monday morning, Mr. Ghosn took a car some 100 yards in heavy rain to a smaller jet that ferried him to Lebanon on Monday, the people added. Questioned by police, a crew member identified Mr. Ghosn as being the passenger from photos.
Turkey-based aircraft operator MNG Jet Havacilik AS, which operated the two planes used in Mr. Ghosn's journey, found the black container, and another holding loudspeakers, on the long-range aircraft after its flight from Japan.
On the subsequent flight, from Turkey to Lebanon, Mr. Ghosn was accompanied by an employee of MNG Jet. The company has filed a complaint against the employee, accusing him of doctoring records to hide Mr. Ghosn's presence on the flights.
The employee explained to investigators how one of the black cases had been used to load Mr. Ghosn onto the plane in Osaka, the people familiar with the matter said.
A photo of the long-range plane's cabin, provided to The Wall Street Journal by people familiar with the probe, shows a black container, with metal-reinforced corners, wedged into the central aisle near the back of the aircraft.
The audio-equipment boxes have become central evidence in the Turkish investigation.

"Inside a box, Mr. Ghosn was mere cargo transiting through Istanbul," one of the people said. "The minute he stepped out of it, he became a possible illegal alien. He should have remained in the box all the way to Beirut."
On Thursday and Friday, Turkish authorities questioned the MNG Jet employee and eight other people in connection with the flights. A lawyer for the employee, Okan Kosemen, said his client didn't commit any crime. The attorney, Mehmet Fatih Danaci, said he couldn't discuss the specifics of the case.
On Friday, Turkish prosecutors said they had charged Mr. Kosemen and four pilots who hail from the Turkish air force with migrant smuggling. The five men were sent to jail pending trial.
Mr. Taylor didn't accompany Mr. Ghosn on the flight to Lebanon, where the private contractor has close ties. He is married to a Lebanese woman and two of his sons live in the country.
The other man traveling with Mr. Taylor was identified as George Antoine Zayek, according to people familiar with the matter. A George Zayek has served as a security employee at companies owned by or linked to Mr. Taylor, according to online profiles posted to job-networking websites.
Mr. Taylor made headlines when the New York Times hired his former firm, Boston-based American International Security Corp., to help extract reporter David Rohde from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan in 2009.
Mr. Taylor more recently served time in a U.S. prison after pleading guilty to a wire-fraud charge stemming from a federal bid-rigging investigation into $54 million in Defense Department contracts. Mr. Taylor through his attorney had disputed the charges, saying he was a legitimate businessman. He was released in December 2015, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons inmate locator. The government returned $2 million seized from him, court documents show.
After landing in Turkey on Monday, Mr. Taylor and the man identified as Mr. Zayek made their way to Istanbul's new airport and took a commercial flight to Beirut, passing through Turkish passport checks on arrival and departure, the people familiar with the Turkish probe said.
Turkish investigators have copies of both men's passports showing exit stamps from Japan and Turkey, these people said.
When Mr. Ghosn arrived in Beirut on Monday morning, he sent a friend a message a little before 8 a.m. saying in French simply. "Hello. Call me," according to a person familiar with the situation.
The friend called him. Mr. Ghosn told him he was in Beirut. The friend hung up, washed his face and called back. They met later that day.
Mr. Ghosn and his wife, Carole Ghosn, celebrated New Year's Eve at the house of a friend, according to a person familiar with the matter. That night, Mrs. Ghosn told the Journal that the couple was "so happy" and described being reunited with her husband as the "best gift of my life."
Mr. Ghosn has been spending time in a pink mansion in Beirut that Nissan bought and renovated for his use when he worked for the Japanese car maker, according to a person familiar with the matter. Nissan has been trying to evict the Ghosns from the house since shortly after the auto executive's arrest in late 2018, but so far they have been able to stay.
On Friday, more than a dozen reporters stood outside the house in the rain. Security personnel dressed in black and hired by Nissan stood guard. Mr. Ghosn's lawyer, Carlos Abou Jaoude, was seen going into the house on Thursday. Cars with blacked-out windows were entering and exiting the house's garage that day.
Mr. Ghosn has been busy preparing for a press conference scheduled to be held late next week, according to people familiar with the matter. At that time he is unlikely to address how he managed to escape Japan, one of these people said.

Opinion: Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism

Texto completo: In defending President Trump’s Executive Order that will in effect crack down on criticism of Israel by college students or professors, Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, declared in a New York Times op-ed that “Anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism.” He could not be more wrong.
Zionism is a political movement just like the temperance movement or the pro-choice movement. It’s a group of ideas with a goal. It calls for a country run strictly for the benefit of Jews. One can oppose that idea without being a racist hater of Jews. Indeed, Zionism has only had a mass following among Jews since the last years of the 1800s. It wasn’t until the Holocaust that it had any real following among Orthodox Jews.
Famous Jewish anti-Zionists included New York Times publisher Adolph Simon Ochs, violinist Yehudi Menuhin, Reform rabbi Elmer Berger, Auschwitz survivor Hago Meyer, and the anti-Nazi intelligence agent Leopold Trepper. Prominent today are Israeli lawyer Lea Tzemel, the American writer Ben Ehrenreich and Daniel Boyarin, Professor of Talmudic Culture at UC Berkeley. Groups of anti-Zionists included the tens of thousands in Europe in the pre-WWII Bund movement, the Israeli Jews in the Matzpen movement, the American Council for Judaism. Anti-Zionist Jewish groups today include 20,000 Ultra-Orthodox Satmar Jews, the Neturei Karta and the U.S. group Jewish Voice for Peace with its
half-million Facebook followers
.
There are many valid reasons to oppose Zionism. Among them are Israel’s savage mistreatment of Palestinians, its regard of Jews outside Israel as inferiors and Zionist leaders’ long treacherous history of deals with anti-Semites, ultra-rightists and in some cases killers of Jews.
Necessary work against real anti-Semitism is being politically exploited and undermined by the the Kushners, Trumps, and Boris Johnsons of the world and from right-wing forces within Israel. They hobnob with “illiberals” who glorify and cover up the record of nationalists who collaborated with German Nazis during World War II. They defend the modern-day authoritarians saying, “They can’t be anti-Semitic because they’re pro-Israel.”
It is grotesque that Jared Kushner has the gall to pontificate about anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. He serves in the administration of Donald Trump, which has opened the floodgates of hate, whose “Great” America has seen the worst massacre of Jews in American history, and who often uses anti-Jewish slurs.
It is grotesque that this false equivocation is made and given serious consideration at a time when we should be focusing instead on what the Israeli government is doing, tearing down Palestinian homes, dividing Palestinian land with wall after wall, locking Palestinians up without charges or trials, excusing virtually all police or army killings of Palestinians, and launching a massacre in Gaza every few years.

Texto completo: The former head of HBO, Richard Plepler, has signed an exclusive production deal with Apple to make TV shows and movies for the iPhone maker's new streaming service, Apple TV Plus.
Plepler is well known in the entertainment industry and cultivated HBO's reputation for “prestige” TV. He left the company after AT&T bought its owner, Time Warner. AT&T began changing Time Warner, now known as WarnerMedia, to fuel the creation of more content for its own streaming service, HBO Max, which is expected to launch this spring. AT&T has kept the HBO name for the service but made it more mass-market than the cable channel, including adding old hit TV shows like “Friends” and “The Big Bang Theory.”
Apple TV Plus launched last fall with a significantly smaller catalog than Netflix, Disney Plus and other streamers. It's aiming for quality, stocking its TV shows and movies with Hollywood stars and power players. Its handful of shows landed mixed reviews from TV critics, but one of the most high-profile, “The Morning Show,” received several Golden Globe nominations. Apple has not disclosed how many subscribers it has. It has a potentially huge customer base among Apple's loyal users and the cheapest price of the major streamers at $5 a month.
Apple says Plepler's new production company, Eden Productions, based in New York, will be a “boutique" shop that makes a "few select" shows and movies — a strategy that could bring to mind HBO's old approach. Plepler said in a statement that he's excited to work with the team at Apple, which he called “one of the most creative companies in the world" and the “perfect home” for his “next chapter.”
Plepler is a good fit with Apple, which for now is focusing on quality original programming over building a big library of shows and movies, said Michael Greeson, the president of Diffusion Group, a media research firm.
The New York Times on Thursday first reported Plepler and Apple's new deal.

Texto completo: World
TAIPEI, Taiwan - Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen convened a meeting of top defense officials today following a helicopter crash that killed the island's top military officer and other prominent personnel.
In a tweet, Tsai said the morning conference focused on ensuring military morale, security in and around the Taiwan Strait and the importance of "complete equipment inspections."
That followed the grounding for inspection of Taiwan's 52 UH-60M Black Hawk choppers belonging to the air force, army and National Airborne Service Corps.
Thursday morning's crash in forested mountains outside the capital Taipei killed eight people including chief of the general staff Gen. Shen Yi-ming, 63. A former pilot and air force chief, Shen had since July been largely responsible for overseeing the self-governing island's defense against China.
Ghosn wanted
by Interpol
BEIRUT - Interpol issued a wanted notice Thursday for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, who jumped bail in Japan and fled to Lebanon rather than face trial on financial misconduct charges in a dramatic escape that has confounded and embarrassed authorities.
Lebanese Justice Minister Albert Serhan told the Associated Press in an interview that Lebanon "will carry out its duties," suggesting for the first time that the automotive titan may be brought in for questioning. But he said Ghosn entered the country on a legal passport, and he appeared to cast doubt on the possibility Lebanon would hand Ghosn over to Japan.
Lebanon must now decide how to deal with the Interpol-issued Red Notice, which is a nonbinding request to law enforcement agencies worldwide that they locate and provisionally arrest a fugitive.
Creator defends
UAE spying app
ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates - If the popular ToTok video and voice calling app is a spying tool of the United Arab Emirates, that's news to its co-creator.
Giacomo Ziani defended his work, saying he had no knowledge that people and companies linked to the project had ties to the country's intelligence apparatus, despite a recent report in the New York Times.
Millions downloaded the ToTok app on Apple and Google. Its surge in popularity was likely because it allowed users to make internet calls that have long been banned in the UAE.

Electric cars charging toward heart of Germany's economy

Texto completo: ÖHRINGEN, Germany - Öhringen lies deep in automaking country, homeland of Germany's biggest industry and a source of national pride. And by most appearances, life is pretty good.
The unemployment rate in Öhringen is a mere 2.3%. Restaurants, nursing homes and kindergartens are begging for workers. The city government is using bulging tax receipts to build a new secondary school and a hospital.
But just outside Öhringen's tidy old quarter, dominated by the steeple of a 15th-century stone church, there are signs that the economic upswing that has nourished this idyll is beginning to falter.
A factory that makes air filters is closing, putting 240 people out of work. The plant, owned by Mahle, an auto parts manufacturer based in nearby Stuttgart, is a victim of forces that are reshaping the auto industry and threatening the foundation of the German economy.
Global car sales are declining at the same time that companies are pouring billions of dollars into new technologies like autonomous driving and electric cars, which are easier to assemble and require fewer workers and fewer parts.
Carmakers, including Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi division, as well as suppliers like Continental and Bosch, have announced tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks. German auto production will be at a 22-year low in 2019 and 2020, according to calculations by Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Workers are feeling the brunt, and not just in Germany. The upheaval in auto technology was an undercurrent in the United Automobile Workers' recent strike against General Motors, with GM aiming for flexibility in staffing levels as it devotes more resources to electric vehicles.
The growing popularity of electric vehicles could force a shift in the balance of power in the global car business that would have long-term consequences for Germany.
So far, sales of electric cars make up a small share of the overall auto market, but they are growing fast. In October, battery-powered cars and hybrids accounted for almost 10% of new car registrations in Europe, according to JATO, a market research firm; figures from another firm, LMC Automotive, put the share at less than 4% in the U.S. Sales of those cars in Europe were up 40% from a year earlier in an otherwise stagnant market.
If the trend continues, it spells trouble for the hundreds of suppliers that make parts for internal combustion engines. The Mahle factory in Öhringen makes equipment that controls the flow of air in diesel and gasoline motors.
"There is a transition toward more electric vehicles that have far fewer components and are easier to manufacture," Bernhard Mattes, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview in Berlin. "Therefore, we can expect less employment."
Mattes, former head of Ford's operations in Germany, quoted studies estimating that a shift to electric cars could cost 70,000 jobs in Germany by 2030. Some estimates are higher.
The effect of those cuts may be felt most acutely in communities like Öhringen, where the local economy revolves around small and midsize manufacturers, often serving the auto industry. Audi, Porsche and Daimler all have factories within a 40-mile radius.
Thilo Michler, the mayor of Öhringen, said the local economy was diverse enough to survive the closing of the Mahle plant. The city, with about 25,000 residents, is also the home of other midsize companies such as Huber Packaging, the world's largest manufacturer of 5-liter beer kegs.
Unemployment is so low that most Mahle workers will probably find new jobs by the time the plant ceases operations by the end of 2020. But they will have trouble finding work that pays as well, and they may have to accept temporary contracts that offer little job security, said Rüdiger Bresien, an official of the IG Metall union who represents workers in the area.

Church shooting isn't only about a heroic act

Texto completo: Jack Wilson is a hero alright. It took him only six seconds to kill a gunman at a Texas church, saving countless lives.
Unfortunately, that kind of split-second heroism has turned into a PR tool by gun advocates.
The reality of Wilson's heroism is a lot more complex. He wasn't just an ordinary parishioner, as gun advocates may want you to believe. The church's volunteer security team member is a firearms instructor, gun range owner and former reserve deputy with a local sheriff's department, according to a New York Times detailed account.
In other words, he's exactly the kind of man you want around with a firearm. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas.
And that's terrifying.
Of course, that wouldn't matter to the churchgoers of that community of roughly 18,000 residents, right? What matters is that Wilson saved them with a single shot and other gun-wielding parishioners were ready just in case Wilson failed.
But have we really reached a point when each of us need to carry a firearm anywhere we go? Gun advocates certainly think so. They point to Wilson and the new Texas law that allows him and others to carry firearms inside the church.
President Donald Trump said as much on Twitter Monday:
"Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday's church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"
Texas has one of the nation's least restrictive gun laws, including allowing armed security at houses of worship and allowing parishioners to bring their weapons to church. Gun advocates didn't waste any time after the recent church incident to promote the idea of arming oneself.
The Second Amendment gives Americans the right to bear arms. And that isn't going anywhere. But that constitutional amendment doesn't spell out the types of firearms Americans should bear, nor does it give Americans the right to sell them to anyone to carry anywhere.
The gunman at West Freeway Church of Christ, 43-year-old Keith Thomas Kinnunen, apparently had a long criminal history, including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Authorities say they're still investigating the motive of Sunday's shooting, and there were no immediate details about how he got the firearm he used at the church.
We know firearms are readily available to anyone who wants one, really. And that's part of the problem. Sunday's shooting isn't just about Jack Wilson's heroism. It's about how Kinnunen got a hold of a weapon in the first place, given his criminal record.

Texto completo: Authorities in Turkey on Thursday were questioning seven people, including four pilots, about the role they may have played helping Carlos Ghosn make his escape from Tokyo to Beirut, offering new clues to his mysterious flight.
Elsewhere, prosecutors raided Ghosn's home in Tokyo, a Lebanese government minister said the public prosecutor had received a "red notice" from Interpol, and a French official said authorities there wouldn't extradite Ghosn if he were to travel to the country.
Four days after Ghosn triumphantly announced his arrival in Beirut, law enforcement officials and authorities were left grappling with the legal implications of the former automotive executive's stunning escape, whose details remain shrouded in mystery.
Ghosn, the former chief executive of Nissan and Renault, left Japan on Sunday to avoid trial on financial misconduct charges there, though his movements were supposed to be strictly limited while he was free on bail. He turned up in Lebanon, saying he had escaped the "rigged Japanese justice system."
The Lebanese justice minister, Albert Serhan, said Thursday that the public prosecutor had received a "red notice" from Interpol related to Ghosn's case, according to the state-run National News Agency. The red notice akin to a "wanted" poster, and not an arrest warrant, is issued for individuals wanted for prosecution or to serve a sentence. It is up to each individual country to decide how to respond.
Ghosn, who has not appeared in public since he announced he was in Lebanon, issued a statement Thursday that seemed aimed to protect his family from any legal jeopardy.
"There has been speculation in the media that my wife Carole, and other members of my family played a role in my departure from Japan," the statement said. "All such speculation is inaccurate and false. I alone arranged for my departure. My family had no role whatsoever."
Hours earlier, a French government minister said authorities there would not extradite Ghosn if he arrived there, "because France never extradites its nationals."
"That's a rule of the game," junior economy minister Agnès Pannier-Runacher told the news channel BFM.
In Turkey, authorities detained seven people suspected of helping Ghosn escape, according to news outlets there. He reportedly left Japan late Sunday aboard a business jet from Osaka to Istanbul Ataturk Airport, where he quickly switched to another plane and flew to Beirut.
Much about his cinematic flight remains unknown, including how he was able to escape surveillance in Japan, how he arranged his flights to Lebanon and whether he was helped by any other countries. The French foreign ministry declined to comment on allegations that Ghosn had used a French passport to leave Japan.
Ghosn, who has been charged in Japan with an array of financial crimes, was born in Brazil to a Lebanese family, grew up mostly in Lebanon and has lived most of his adult life in France. He has passports from all three countries, though his lawyers in Japan have said that they held the documents.

Texto completo: On Christmas day, Greta Gerwig's updated version of the young adult classic "Little Women" opened in theaters to great acclaim, fantastic reviews and strong box office numbers.
And yet, some women found fault with the fact that not enough men were flocking to see it.
In a piece for The New York Times, writer Kristy Eldredge observed that the film hadn't garnered a lot of award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild (zero) and the Golden Globes (two), and mentioned that the audiences seemed to be overwhelmingly filled with women. Film producer Amy Pascal agrees, arguing in Vanity Fair that many male awards-season voters are skipping Gerwig's adaptation because they think it's not for guys.
Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: "If many men haven't wanted to give it a chance because they don't think it's meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention."
It's not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written over 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set. While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like "A Separate Peace" and "Catcher in the Rye," which have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield's existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny's tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity. You could imagine a female Holden, or an equally traumatic betrayal between two young women at an all-girls school.
But "Little Women" is really just a movie about females, and their dreams and aspirations and disappointments, and that's perfectly OK. In fact, it's sublime. The book and the movies adapted from it are some of the most touching examples of female bonding in literary and cinematic history. As a Bryn Mawr graduate - like Katharine Hepburn - I am partial to the 1933 film, but Gerwig's adaptation is exceptional and deserving of all the accolades it will earn, despite the naysayers.
But it is a bit ridiculous for women to be complaining that men are not interested in a book and movie called, for lord's sake, "Little WOMEN." This preoccupation with "gender parity" has become cult-like.
I know a bunch of boys around the age of 11 or 12 who love dinosaurs and Jedis. They also love Harry Potter, "The Lord of the Rings," R.L. Stine, and any number of things that girls the same age might also enjoy. These are clearly things that bridge a gender divide because they are not specifically "male" or "female."
But when I was growing up, there were toys you gave to boys and toys you gave to girls, and it was not considered a hate crime to insist that your daughter not be given a GI Joe doll or that your son put down the Barbie. It was okay to recognize that there were stereotypes for a reason, namely, that boys and girls had different interests.
I don't share the angst over a presumed lack of interest on the part of men about the destinies of Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth March.
Ironically, Louisa May Alcott herself wasn't thrilled with the idea of writing what she called a "girls' story." She wrote in her diary: "I plod away, though I don't enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters; but our queer plays and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it."
If even the writer of this wonderful girls' story doesn't expect boys to like it, why in the world should we?

Texto completo: N.Y. Times opinions veer too far left
I couldn't be more disappointed in your decision to use The New York Times for editorial content ("Editor's Note: NY Times content," Jan. 2).
The NYT is hardly renowned. It is a shell of its former self that was once renowned. Today it is a dying publication that is a mouthpiece for far-left progressive socialistic ideas. Editorial content, described as supposed news, regularly appears on page A1. I've long given up reading anything by extreme left-wing ideologues like Paul Krugman and Maureen Dowd.
Jim Tischler Sanford
Thanks for bringing Times to Opinion pages
Thank you for including content from such a respected newspaper as the New York Times. For me, it's a good reason to continue my subscription to the Sentinel.

Laud faith groups for acts of kindness
I loved Scott Maxwell's column "We can do much better as Christians" (Jan. 1). I completely agree that "in politics, the people who scream the loudest about the Lord often seem to be his worst disciples." I am grateful that I know many parishioners who inspire me to keep practicing my faith.
Please report on the many acts of kindness and decency that faith groups are doing (Stetson Baptist Church pays off medical debt; Apopka nuns; Catholic Charities; Jewish Family Services; Muslim Social Services, etc.). Even if you are an atheist, I would guess more examples of human decency would be appreciated instead of the too-frequent example of those who don a Christian mask to exploit others.
I resist describing anyone as "Christian" because it often implies a "we're better than them" kind of feeling. I prefer to use the term "Christ-like" since that can describe anyone of great character regardless of their faith background. May 2020 be a year of increased acts of kindness with more Christians acting more Christ-like. As the saying goes, "Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words."

DeSantis must not be conned into executing James Dailey Orlando Sentinel Editorial

Texto completo: Ron DeSantis was elected governor because millions of Floridians trusted his judgment. Now it appears he might be falling for a horrific con job.
The victim won't be the governor. It will be James Dailey, who has spent the past 32 years on death row.
He was scheduled to be executed in November but was granted a stay. It expired Monday, and DeSantis must decide whether to grant the 73-year-old Dailey a clemency hearing or sign a new death warrant.
If he chooses the latter, DeSantis will betray the faith voters had in him.
Dailey was convicted of killing 14-year-old Shelly Boggio in 1985. We don't know what truly happened that night, but it has become starkly obvious the case against Dailey was built on baloney.
The key witness was someone the Department of Corrections termed "a con artist of the highest degree."
That would be Paul Skalnik, whose resume includes child molestation, eight wives, at least 25 convictions of crimes of fraud and dishonesty and a well-deserved reputation as an all-time great jailhouse snitch.
Authorities in Pinellas County relied on him for a conviction after Boggio's 1985 murder. Her nude body was found floating in a waterway near Indian Rocks Beach.
Boggio had been stabbed 31 times, dragged into the water and left to drown. Police arrested Dailey and his housemate, Jack Pearcy.
He was spotted with Boggio at a bar and had a long criminal record and history of domestic violence. Pearcy tried shifting the blame to Dailey, who said he was home asleep during the crime.
Pearcy was tried first and found guilty of murder. The jury gave him a life sentence, but not the death penalty an enraged public wanted.
Pearcy refused to testify against Dailey, and there was no forensic evidence linking Dailey to the crime. So prosecutors turned to an old, reliable jailhouse informant.
Skalnik was facing 20 years in prison for grand theft, but informants routinely receive favorable treatment if they help prosecute other crimes. Though he was a well-known snitch, Skalnik said Dailey admitted the crime to him.
Skalnik's elaborate recounting of Boggio's murder was crucial. The jury unanimously recommended the death penalty for Dailey.
Skalnik told the jury he wasn't promised special treatment for testifying. Yet five days after Dailey's conviction he was released from jail.
Dailey's plight gained national attention last month after an expose by Pamela Colloff for ProPublica in partnership with the New York Times Magazine. The story shined a damning light on the whole jailhouse snitch business.
Of 367 DNA exonerations nationwide, informants played a role in 20% of wrongful convictions. Florida has had 29 exonerations, more than any other state.
That alarming frequency prompted a 2014 law that required prosecutors to disclose to juries the deals they make with informants. If there were a Jailhouse Snitch Hall of Fame, Skalnik would be a first-ballot shoo-in.
From 1981 to 1987 alone, he testified or provided information in at least 37 cases in Pinellas County. When he was seeking leniency in 1984, he boasted about his record in a letter to then-Sen. Lawton Chiles.
"I have placed 34 individuals in prison," Skalnik wrote, "including four on death row."
He was slated to testify in three more murder trials after Dailey's conviction, but he skipped town in a stolen rental car. Skalnik has spent most of the past 30 years in and out of Texas prisons.
Dailey's appeals were slowly exhausted and he seemed destined for execution until two years ago. The Capital Collateral Regional Counsel, a state agency that represents indigent death-row inmates, took up his case.
Lawyers eventually visited Pearcy, who told them he alone murdered Boggio. They appealed to the Florida Supreme Court for a new trial.
The court refused, saying, "Dailey neglects to explain why this information could not have been discovered earlier."
So it's Dailey's fault for not exposing Skalnik sooner?
Dailey's fate now rests solely with DeSantis. When he signed the death warrant in September, he said, "This has been litigated over and over and over, and so at some point you need to do justice."
But what is justice?
Pearcy says he will testify that Dailey did not kill Boggio. Even if you dismiss him as a liar with nothing to lose, the fact remains there were no witnesses or physical evidence tying Dailey to the crime.
The strongest thread was Skalnik, a man whose word the state admits is worthless.
If that's not enough to warrant a clemency hearing, Gov. DeSantis, what is?

Good news about the state of the American family

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes. The critically-acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its costar Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and often raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant nowadays. Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing."
But the story of the death of marriage has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce and the collapse of the institution of marriage, the reality is that there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall. Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s, offering their children a better shot a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, nonmarital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
The rate of nonmarital childbearing has fallen from 41.% in 2009 to 39.6% in 2018. We think what has happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upwards. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock mean more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upward in the coming years. What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes. All of this is good news for our children. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.

Electric cars charging toward heart of Germany's economy

Texto completo: ÖHRINGEN, Germany - Öhringen lies deep in automaking country, homeland of Germany's biggest industry and a source of national pride. And by most appearances, life is pretty good.
The unemployment rate in Öhringen is a mere 2.3%. Restaurants, nursing homes and kindergartens are begging for workers. The city government is using bulging tax receipts to build a new secondary school and a hospital.
But just outside Öhringen's tidy old quarter, dominated by the steeple of a 15th-century stone church, there are signs that the economic upswing that has nourished this idyll is beginning to falter.
A factory that makes air filters is closing, putting 240 people out of work. The plant, owned by Mahle, an auto parts manufacturer based in nearby Stuttgart, is a victim of forces that are reshaping the auto industry and threatening the foundation of the German economy.
Global car sales are declining at the same time that companies are pouring billions of dollars into new technologies like autonomous driving and electric cars, which are easier to assemble and require fewer workers and fewer parts.
Carmakers, including Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi division, as well as suppliers like Continental and Bosch, have announced tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks. German auto production will be at a 22-year low in 2019 and 2020, according to calculations by Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Workers are feeling the brunt, and not just in Germany. The upheaval in auto technology was an undercurrent in the United Automobile Workers' recent strike against General Motors, with GM aiming for flexibility in staffing levels as it devotes more resources to electric vehicles.
The growing popularity of electric vehicles could force a shift in the balance of power in the global car business that would have long-term consequences for Germany.
So far, sales of electric cars make up a small share of the overall auto market, but they are growing fast. In October, battery-powered cars and hybrids accounted for almost 10% of new car registrations in Europe, according to JATO, a market research firm; figures from another firm, LMC Automotive, put the share at less than 4% in the U.S. Sales of those cars in Europe were up 40% from a year earlier in an otherwise stagnant market.
If the trend continues, it spells trouble for the hundreds of suppliers that make parts for internal combustion engines. The Mahle factory in Öhringen makes equipment that controls the flow of air in diesel and gasoline motors.
"There is a transition toward more electric vehicles that have far fewer components and are easier to manufacture," Bernhard Mattes, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview in Berlin. "Therefore, we can expect less employment."
Mattes, former head of Ford's operations in Germany, quoted studies estimating that a shift to electric cars could cost 70,000 jobs in Germany by 2030. Some estimates are higher.
The effect of those cuts may be felt most acutely in communities like Öhringen, where the local economy revolves around small and midsize manufacturers, often serving the auto industry. Audi, Porsche and Daimler all have factories within a 40-mile radius.
Thilo Michler, the mayor of Öhringen, said the local economy was diverse enough to survive the closing of the Mahle plant. The city, with about 25,000 residents, is also the home of other midsize companies such as Huber Packaging, the world's largest manufacturer of 5-liter beer kegs.
Unemployment is so low that most Mahle workers will probably find new jobs by the time the plant ceases operations by the end of 2020. But they will have trouble finding work that pays as well, and they may have to accept temporary contracts that offer little job security, said Rüdiger Bresien, an official of the IG Metall union who represents workers in the area.

Texto completo: ÖHRINGEN, Germany - Öhringen lies deep in automaking country, homeland of Germany's biggest industry and a source of national pride. And by most appearances, life is pretty good.
The unemployment rate in Öhringen is a mere 2.3%. Restaurants, nursing homes and kindergartens are begging for workers. The city government is using bulging tax receipts to build a new secondary school and a hospital.
But just outside Öhringen's tidy old quarter, dominated by the steeple of a 15th-century stone church, there are signs that the economic upswing that has nourished this idyll is beginning to falter.
A factory that makes air filters is closing, putting 240 people out of work. The plant, owned by Mahle, an auto parts manufacturer based in nearby Stuttgart, is a victim of forces that are reshaping the auto industry and threatening the foundation of the German economy.
Global car sales are declining at the same time that companies are pouring billions of dollars into new technologies like autonomous driving and electric cars, which are easier to assemble and require fewer workers and fewer parts.
Carmakers, including Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi division, as well as suppliers like Continental and Bosch, have announced tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks. German auto production will be at a 22-year low in 2019 and 2020, according to calculations by Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Workers are feeling the brunt, and not just in Germany. The upheaval in auto technology was an undercurrent in the United Automobile Workers' recent strike against General Motors, with GM aiming for flexibility in staffing levels as it devotes more resources to electric vehicles.
The growing popularity of electric vehicles could force a shift in the balance of power in the global car business that would have long-term consequences for Germany.
So far, sales of electric cars make up a small share of the overall auto market, but they are growing fast. In October, battery-powered cars and hybrids accounted for almost 10% of new car registrations in Europe, according to JATO, a market research firm; figures from another firm, LMC Automotive, put the share at less than 4% in the U.S. Sales of those cars in Europe were up 40% from a year earlier in an otherwise stagnant market.

Texto completo: Jack Wilson is a hero alright. It took him only six seconds to kill a gunman at a Texas church, saving countless lives.
Unfortunately, that kind of split-second heroism has turned into a PR tool by gun advocates.
The reality of Wilson's heroism is a lot more complex. He wasn't just an ordinary parishioner, as gun advocates may want you to believe. The church's volunteer security team member is a firearms instructor, gun range owner and former reserve deputy with a local sheriff's department, according to a New York Times detailed account.
In other words, he's exactly the kind of man you want around with a firearm. But we know nothing about the at least six other parishioners who also appeared to draw their handguns at West Freeway Church of Christ in White Settlement, Texas.
And that's terrifying.
Of course, that wouldn't matter to the churchgoers of that community of roughly 18,000 residents, right? What matters is that Wilson saved them with a single shot and other gun-wielding parishioners were ready just in case Wilson failed.
But have we really reached a point when each of us need to carry a firearm anywhere we go? Gun advocates certainly think so. They point to Wilson and the new Texas law that allows him and others to carry firearms inside the church.
President Donald Trump said as much on Twitter Monday:
"Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday's church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!"
Texas has one of the nation's least restrictive gun laws, including allowing armed security at houses of worship and allowing parishioners to bring their weapons to church. Gun advocates didn't waste any time after the recent church incident to promote the idea of arming oneself.
The Second Amendment gives Americans the right to bear arms. And that isn't going anywhere. But that constitutional amendment doesn't spell out the types of firearms Americans should bear, nor does it give Americans the right to sell them to anyone to carry anywhere.
The gunman at West Freeway Church of Christ, 43-year-old Keith Thomas Kinnunen, apparently had a long criminal history, including aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Authorities say they're still investigating the motive of Sunday's shooting, and there were no immediate details about how he got the firearm he used at the church.
We know firearms are readily available to anyone who wants one, really. And that's part of the problem. Sunday's shooting isn't just about Jack Wilson's heroism. It's about how Kinnunen got a hold of a weapon in the first place, given his criminal record.

Task force tackles child sex crime cases online

Texto completo: Images and videos of child sexual abuse don't only exist in the dark corners of the internet. They are hiding in plain sight across New Mexico.
From January through Nov. 1, there were 977 investigations in the state into reports of adults creating, possessing or distributing images of child sex crimes, and committing other sex crimes against children, over the internet. That number, experts say, is more than double the number from last year. And while every viewing of those images is a crime, prosecutors say it also is a sign that a person might plan to — or already has — sexually abused a child.
"These are individuals that, generally speaking, are extremely dangerous, and a lot of times, there's this misnomer that these are just images," said state Deputy Attorney General Clara Moran.
Moran and other prosecutors do not like the commonly used term "child pornography" because it likens images of abuse to the legal, somewhat regulated industry of adult pornographic content, she said. Moran makes it plain: Many of these images are of children being raped.
While some people tend to believe such images involve children in faraway places, the reality is much different. Almost 90 percent involve children in the U.S., including New Mexico, said Anthony Maez, special agent and commander of the state attorney general's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.
The task force has reviewed about 1,400 cyber-tips received from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, peer-to-peer networks and individuals, Maez said. Of the five types of crimes investigated by the group, the number involving images of child sexual abuse is by far the largest.
Not every tip leads to an investigation.
In 2019, the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force has received 592 documented complaints about possession of images of child sexual abuse, 304 about distribution of such images and 63 about creation of images, according to data provided by Maez.
"The number of tips that we see coming in, the volume is very high," he said, "and unfortunately there isn't enough law enforcement officers around the state to work these types of tips."
State law enforcement agencies have ratcheted up their battle against internet crimes against children. About 276 agents across 90 local, state, military and tribal agencies investigate these crimes. Together, they have received 76 documented complaints of child enticement, 21 complaints of a person traveling to meet a child with intentions of abuse, 52 complaints of adults directing obscenities to a minor and 14 complaints of sex trafficking of children, according to data collected by the task force.
An exploding problem Maez points to the ever-evolving world of social media and apps that make it easier to exploit children.
A recent investigation by the New York Times revealed many predators connect with children through gaming or social media platforms and chatrooms — venues that weren't as accessible five to 10 years ago. In 2008, the newspaper reported, 3,000 images of child sexual abuse had been reported. In 2018, there were more than 18 million.
Each new app, Maez said, is a new opportunity for child exploitation.
Criminal complaints, grand jury indictments and affidavits for search warrants filed in New Mexico's First Judicial District Court show how prevalent the use of social media and electronic devices is when it comes to the exploitation of children.
One such affidavit, filed Nov. 18, says blogging sites Tumblr and Reddit reported a 24-year-old man from Chimayó had uploaded images of child sexual abuse. A search of online court records shows he has not yet been charged with a crime. Another affidavit, filed in 2017, goes into graphic detail about a series of videos of girls ages 7 to 10 that authorities believe were shared by a Santa Fe man on a peer-to-peer website.
Española police Detective Ernest Saucedo wrote in a Dec. 3 affidavit that he received three tips from the attorney general's internet crimes task force accusing a 21-year-old man of uploading images of child sexual abuse online using three Yahoo email addresses. The man, Austin Martinez, has been charged with one count of possession of a visual medium of sexual exploitation of a child under 13.
There is no overarching profile of a person who views graphic images of children being sexually abused. Offenders live in both rural and urban areas, and while they tend to be male, they can be of any age.
A growing fight Each month, the task force receives about 110 tips from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the national clearinghouse for all reports made to the cyber-tip line, as well as reports from social media companies, which monitor their sites for potential illegal activity.
Of those 110 reports in New Mexico, Maez said about 63 percent originated from a person who saw an image on Facebook and reported it or from the company's detection software.
Facebook's latest transparency report says the company removed 11.6 million child abuse images worldwide from its social network from July through September of this year. Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, removed about 512,000 images.
"Each time it is shared is a revictimization of that child victim," said Matt Baca, a spokesman for the New Mexico Attorney General's Office. "It is important for people to recognize that the sharing and individual viewing is a reoffense."
Concerns over the spread of images of child sexual abuse on the internet has prompted smaller police departments to become more aggressive. Roger Jimenez, interim chief of the Española Police Department, said his agency recently began working with the task force.
"It definitely does hit closer to home for some of the officers that actually live in a community where they're investigating these specific crimes," he said.
Often, officers will already know victims or the accused, Jimenez said, and that added level of familiarity makes the cases more difficult to handle.
Finding perpetrators Task force members say the long road to success in prosecuting internet crimes against children is similar to other kinds of sensitive investigations: Extensive interviews and researching a suspect's past are key before executing a search warrant.
You get one shot to find evidence in these types of cases, New Mexico State Police Agent Jessie Whittaker said, because once a suspect knows what investigators are looking for, they often will try to destroy or hide devices containing images -- or any trace that they created or distributed them.
He could go into a house armed with a search warrant but minimal information and "get a little bit of evidence for the case — maybe nothing," Whittaker said, and then realize later that he missed something key to prosecuting the case.
"What's the chance it's going to be there that next time coming back?" he asked.
Whittaker said he seizes cellphones or other devices while executing search warrants and takes them to the FBI's Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Albuquerque. He either gives the agency the materials to review or reviews the evidence himself.
The internet crimes task force also operates a mobile forensics lab, as well as labs across the state, Maez said, to avoid a bottleneck of cases.
"You can't arrest someone until forensics is completed," he said.
Moran said prosecutors typically will seek detention of a suspect after criminal charges are filed. But they are not always successful. In the case of Martinez, state District Judge Jason Lidyard rejected Assistant District Attorney Ihsan Ahmed's motion seeking a detention until trial, ruling the state did not prove Martinez is a danger to the community.
Such decisions frustrate investigators and prosecutors.
"What you get a lot from the defense is that these are just images, they're just images — and that's just not true," Moran said.
Investigators say they believe people who view graphic photos and videos of child sexual abuse could be — and are likely to be — sexually attracted to children and might physically abuse a child.
"If someone is sexually attracted to children, it is not something that goes away," Moran said.
According to experts quoted in the New York Times investigation on the psychology of pedophiles, one study of 127 online offenders who had been arrested showed that less than 5 percent admitted to having molested a child. During in-depth interviews and polygraph tests, however, another 53 percent admitted to having touched a child. Moran said this holds true for New Mexico.
"Sometimes prosecutors can ask for a polygraph, and what we find is that these offenders oftentimes disclose ... they have been hands-on abusers and just haven't been caught or that they are planning to put hands on a child," she said.
Prosecutors and investigators say a law passed this year by the Legislature — the Electronic Communications Privacy Act — makes it more difficult to prosecute crimes against children.
The law requires law enforcement to obtain warrants including the specific information they are seeking on electronic devices, as well as the specific person or account targeted. It also requires that any evidence collected under a search warrant that does not fall under the specifications of the warrant be destroyed within 30 days.
That timeline sometimes does not allow for adequate development of a case involving images of child sexual abuse, Moran said.
"It's essential to these types of cases for law enforcement officers to be able to comb through all of the images," she said. In some cases, there can be terabytes of information to sift through.
Whittaker said the tight timelines also can make it difficult to retain exculpatory evidence, which can help establish a person's innocence if the suspect is arrested and his or her case goes to trial.
Privacy concerns and data breaches also have pushed social media platforms and apps to use end-to-end encryption, which makes conversations between a sender and recipient private and unable to be seen by a third party. In March, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to introduce the technology on Facebook Messenger.
"If Facebook decides to encrypt everything and not (see) who is doing what on the site or have that available, the tips will go down, but the exploitation is taking place out there," Maez said.
Awareness of these crimes, though distasteful, is critical, Maez said. While the majority of investigations by the internet crimes task force involve cases in which a child has been abused previously, Maez said the group also pursues local tips to stop such abuse from ever occurring.
Each year, the task force runs a public service announcement advertising the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's cyber-tip line. Maez also holds bimonthly training on investigatory techniques, such as how to mimic a person who is posting or responding to online ads for child exploitation, dark web surveillance and the use of cryptocurrency like bitcoin to purchase images of child sexual abuse.
"We are trying to cover every possible place where an individual may exploit a child," he said.

Texto completo: Sprouts and the Oakes Farms Seed to Table Market made their Southwest Florida debuts in Collier County in 2019 while Sun Fresh Market entered the region this past year, setting up shop in Fort Myers.
Those joints joined competitors like Lucky's Market, Aldi, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, among others that all have relatively new addresses here on the Gulf Coast.
And now they're adding second, third and more local locations making them more accessible to customers who are new to their products or adoring fans who have experienced them on vacations, in previous hometowns or near their summertime domiciles.
Restaurants from other parts of the country and the world have also begun marching into the Sunshine State.
Most recently, CaliBurger, with its West Coast vibe but Asian origins, brought its robot cooks to Estero. And White Castle just proclaimed its return to Florida after a half-century hiatus.
But who do you want in 2020 that hasn't announced plans yet?
We put out that question to readers in Collier and Lee counties, and you had plenty of suggestions including on the Facebook pages for the Naples Daily News or the Fort Myers News-Press.
So we reached out to various operations, sent them your love and asked when they would get their tushes down here.
We'll keep working to get more answers for future columns. But we'll start with a restaurant chain, a market and a convenience store on your wish lists.
Yolos Mexican Grill We found out that sometimes all you have to do is ask and get connected with the CEO, and that may get you the establishment you want.
Fort Myers resident Charles Quinn, who has spent a lot of time out west, named Yolos Mexican Grill, which is part of the Ark Restaurants chain he experienced in Las Vegas, as one of the "restaurants we need."
Don't know about the food, but its web site sure touts sampling its 60 tequilas before ever mentioning a morsel. Hence, Yolo stands for "you only live once" but never divulging the feeling of only dying once when that hangover comes around the morning after all those Vegas shots. Oh yeah, they kinda did a movie or two or three on that.
We didn't go there with that foolishness when we reached out to Ark CEO Michael Weinstein at the Fifth Avenue office of his New York City-based company. I mean, this is a busy guy.
"Unlike most publicly traded companies," Weinstein said, "we expand not by thinking we need to put a Yolos or other of our concepts in a particular area but rather by responding to a developer who seeks us out."
So you're saying we have a chance?
"If we were approached, we would consider it," he said.
Shazam!
Chain: Ark Restaurants including its Yolos Mexican Grill in Las Vegas
How many: 37 restaurants and bars from upscale to food courts
Background: Law school dropout Michael Weinstein invested $6,000 in 1975 to open a restaurant in what was then a drug-ridden area of Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to The New York Times. In Ark's financial statements just released Tuesday, it had $41.7 million in revenues in the reported 13-week period.
Florida operations: Among them are JB's on the Beach in Deerfield Beach (second on TripAdvisor); Shuckers in Jensen Beach (13th on TripAdvisor) and 10 fast food facilities at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casinos in Tampa and Hollywood, where it just got new digs.
Highlight: Last year, USA Today reported its Bryant Park Grill and Cafe near Times Square as the 9th highest grossing restaurant in the United States.
Wegmans Wegmans was on several lists.
I hear this chain a lot.
"I totally enjoy your column," said Collier County's Pat Smith.
Well, I hear that, too. Well, sometimes. Well, all right. Hardly ever. But I love you guys.
And Pat loves something else.
"I would love to have the grocery store chain, Wegmans, come to Naples," Pat said. "They are based out of Rochester, N.Y."
But wait a minute, Lee County wants its own, too.
Judy Dzwigal, who's in the insurance business in Fort Myers and heads up to the Buffalo area on occasion, said Wegmans is "the best grocery store."
She gets agreement from Fort Myers resident Jason Kohut.
"We need Wegmans in Southwest Florida, being from Syracuse," said Kohut, who's in construction. "Hope they make it to Fort Myers. A bit of home."
Tia Tawn compares "amazing" Wegmans to the new Oakes store, which she says "is a much fancier version" of the northern outlet.
Still, "Wegmans is glorious," Tawn said.
The good news, Wegmans is trekking south.
"We opened our southernmost location in Raleigh, N.C. on Sept. 29," said Tracy Van Auker, the chain's media relations coordinator.
Oh, goodie, so you're saying we have a chance?
"We don't have any stores planned for Florida," Van Auker said.
Shucks!
Chain: Wegmans grocery stores
How many: 101 in seven states, such as New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts
Background: Founded in 1916, tracing its origins to a pushcart.
Florida operations: None; 12-hour drive to Raleigh, the nearest location.
Highlight: It's usually at the top of the list of the nation's most popular groceries. This year, Wegmans topped the Harris Poll ranking of the reputations of the 100 most visible brands in America, beating out companies like Amazon, Costco, and Publix, according to Axios and Business Insider.
Cumberland Farms We've seen how folks get about their Wawas, with the latest opening in Naples of its 100th location in Florida. And Buc-ee's has begun posting manager jobs for its mammoth convenience store coming to I-75 and State Road 82 in Florida.
But what about Cumberland Farms? asks Peter Morin of the Miromar Lakes community.
Yeah, what about it, Mr. Morin?
"Enjoy your column," Morin said.
Oh, OK. Go on.
"A New England chain with large stores and featuring 99-cent iced coffee as a draw," Morin said.
Ah, yes.
But it's not only a northern chain, it has spots right here up and down Florida's east coast.
Seems to give us a fighting chance.
And some Brits just purchased the long-time family brand. Seems like they would be enthusiastic about expanding.
So maybe there's a chance?
"Cumberland Farms is going to respectfully decline commenting," according to a statement issued in response.
Rubbish!
Well, at least the blokes are polite.
Often when folks won't talk it means they might be planning exactly what you're asking about, but in this case, it could mean, hey we just bought this bloody thing, and we're trying to figure it out, mate. The chain has made very few public comments since cutting the deal.
Chain: Cumberland Farms
How many: 570 in eight states from Maine to New York and then nothing until Florida.
Background: Its history goes back to a real Cumberland Farm that had one cow in 1939. Now, United Kingdom-based EG Group is the owner, with its late October deal.
Florida operations: 51 locations in the state along the east coast.
Highlight: The public relations folks may not talk much, but they do know how to roll out the data: "We can fill over 118 oil tankers with the 72 million cups of coffee we sell every year."

U.S. News: Emails Show Clashes Over Ukraine Aid

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A senior Pentagon official clashed with the White House over its decision to freeze security aid to Ukraine, repeatedly warning that the hold could complicate the administration's ability to distribute the money before a congressionally mandated deadline, according to unredacted emails obtained by an outside group.
Beginning in July, Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, sent officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget emails in which she raised concerns about the legality of the hold on nearly $400 million in aid. Though Pentagon officials' frustrations were previously known, the emails, earlier versions of which had been redacted by the Justice Department, offer a new level of detail about Ms. McCusker's concerns.
Ms. McCusker's most dire predictions didn't come true -- at one point she warned that $120 million or more of the aid was at risk of not being spent. But after the White House lifted its hold on Sept. 11, more than $35 million in aid didn't make it to Ukraine by the time the fiscal year ended at the end of that month.
The decision to freeze the aid to Ukraine was at the center of the House's investigation of President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment last month. The Senate is expected to hold a trial, and Democrats are pushing for testimony from administration officials in an effort to determine whether the decision to pause the aid was connected to Mr. Trump's desire for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations that could benefit the president in the 2020 U.S. election. Mr. Trump has said he didn't make the aid contingent on the investigations.
A heavily redacted version of some documents related to the aid was released last month by the Center for Public Integrity through a public information request. Just Security, a group that publishes national security research, reviewed and published portions of the unredacted emails Thursday. An administration official confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that the emails are authentic. The Defense Department didn't respond to requests for comment. Ms. McCusker couldn't be reached for comment.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the emails "a devastating blow to Senator McConnell's push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we've requested."
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) referred to comments the lawmaker made on the Senate floor last month. He said at the time that he wanted to put off any contentious resolutions -- such as those calling witnesses -- until a later phase of the trial.
The new emails reflect tension between Ms. McCusker and OMB. The relationship deteriorated, as senior officials at the office grew skeptical of her estimates of how much money was at risk of not being spent, according to people familiar with their interactions.
In response to the emails, OMB countered that Ms. McCusker's frustrations didn't reflect what they were hearing from other Pentagon officials.
"There was agreement every step of the way between DOD and OMB lawyers, who were responsible for working out the details of the hold, in line with the President's priorities," OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said.
In her emails, Ms. McCusker raised concerns that the White House was violating the Impoundment Control Act, which requires that the executive branch spend money that has been appropriated by Congress.
Ms. McCusker's frustrations escalated in early September. After she warned OMB that $120 million might not be able to be spent by the end of the fiscal year, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at OMB, responded with a letter that put the blame on the Defense Department for not doing enough to prepare to spend the funds.
Ms. McCusker replied, in an exchange first reported by the New York Times, "You can't be serious. I am speechless."

Texto completo: Former HBO Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Plepler signed an exclusive production deal with Apple Inc.'s new TV streaming service, a five-year deal that demonstrates Apple's growing ambitions in entertainment.
The deal will include original series, feature films and documentaries for Apple TV+, according to the company. The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Apple and Mr. Plepler were in advanced discussions, and the New York Times first reported that they had reached a deal.
Mr. Plepler will be working with Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, the company's heads of world-wide video. Mr. Plepler launched Eden Productions, a production company based in New York.
Apple's signing of Mr. Plepler gives its streaming service, which launched Nov. 1 with nine new programs, an experienced and well-known entertainment veteran, as it aims to compete with Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s streaming platforms.
Mr. Plepler had been with HBO for nearly 30 years, the last six as its CEO. He left the company last February after it became clear that he would have less control under AT&T Inc., its new owner, than under prior owner Time Warner Inc.
Apple is in a race to beef up the offerings of its fledgling TV service, which is available for a price of $4.99 a month or free with some purchases of new company merchandise. Apple has struck agreements for shows with producers Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams as well as Oprah Winfrey.

Being 10 percent happier is a pretty good start

Texto completo: Some of us need a new year to resolve to become a better, more enlightened person.
Dan Harris needed a panic attack on live television.
Harris, an ABC news anchor, was doing an update on “Good Morning America" in 2004 when he, as he puts it, freaked out in front of 5 million people.
His heart was beating as if it would burst through his chest. He had trouble breathing.
“It felt like the world was ending," he said.
Harris grew up in Newton. His mother was a pathologist at Mass. General. His father was the chief of radiation oncology at the Brigham. Harris's first stop was a doctor, who concluded the panic attack was the result of his using cocaine and ecstasy, sporadic self-medication that began after spending several years covering war in the Middle East.
He had a disturbing realization. He liked the adrenaline rush he got from war reporting. He was using drugs to re-create it.
“I knew I had to change things," he said.
By coincidence, Peter Jennings, his boss and mentor at ABC, put him on the faith and spirituality beat. Just by doing his job, he got interested in meditation.
A lifelong agnostic, he brought along a healthy sense of skepticism, wary of the gurus in flowing robes and New Age sloganeering.
One of his ABC colleagues, Felicia Biberica, recommended a book by Eckhart Tolle, a German-born spiritual author. At first, Harris dismissed it as hippy codswallop. But Tolle triggered something, if only the realization that we all have a voice in our head, a voice that often tells us to do the things we regret.
Harris interviewed Tolle, finding him “correct, but not useful. He tells us how our minds work, but not what we can do about it."
Harris's wife, a physician, responded to that complaint by giving him a book by Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist who writes about the overlap of psychology and Buddhism.
“The Buddha had something you can do: meditation," Harris said. “I had two thoughts: I should start doing this, and it's a good story."
Harris read a lot. The books helped, but they also left him thinking he could make all the flowery language and emerging science more accessible, less intimidating to a much wider audience.
“I spent five years writing a book," he said.
He got the title for it when another colleague, Chris Sebastian, expressed astonishment that he went on a meditation retreat in Barre, in central Massachusetts.
“It makes me 10 percent happier," Harris told her.
Harris's 2014 book, “10% Happier," was a New York Times bestseller. He resisted a publisher's suggestion to up the percentage in the title.
“There are no silver bullets," he said, meaning you have to do the work, which for him was meditating up to two hours a day. Joseph Goldstein, the teacher who had the biggest impact on Harris, still lives at the Buddhist center in Barre.
Harris acknowledges that as a natural skeptic, he is the most unlikely meditation evangelist. But the science, and even his wife, tells him meditation can make him happier and, as he likes to put it, less of a jerk. He's wary of calling himself a Buddhist.
“I don't view Buddhism as a religion," he said. “There's an expression I like: It's not something to believe in, it's something to do."
He created a free “Ten Percent Happier" podcast with ABC, which produced its 220th episode this week, and a paid subscription app that he runs himself with a staff that works out of a nondescript office in downtown Boston.
“I wonder, would I keep going on retreats and practice and read if it wasn't my job?" he says. “My sense is I would. It's something I'm deeply drawn to. It's useful that I get paid to do this. But at the end of the day, I'm a storyteller and this is constantly fueling the content."

Texto completo: Yes, it's meandering and dense, and it conquers many readers who arrive with good intentions. But we keep coming back to the imposing tale of the elusive white whale. Nathaniel Philbrick, who wrote “Why Read Moby-Dick," has called the Herman Melville classic “about as close to anything we have of an American Bible. It's as much a repository as it is the story of a whaling voyage and in there is just so much of what makes America American."
As the New Bedford Whaling Museum kicks off its 24th annual “Moby-Dick" readathon Friday evening, here are some of Metro Minute's favorite passages from the 1851 masterwork.
The sea beckons Ishmael: “Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off — then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship."
Ishmael muses, at the Spouter Inn : “Better to sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian."
Captain Ahab's obsession: “The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run. Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under torrents' beds, unerringly I rush! Naught's an obstacle, naught's an angle to the iron way!"
The power of the ocean: “The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah's flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers."
A sense of place: “Queequeg was a native of Kokovoko, an island far away to the West and South. It is not down in any map; true places never are."
Ahab's weary soul: “Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! Damned in the midst of Paradise!"
The roiling within: “Consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life."

Texto completo: Ten months after he chafed under AT&T's takeover of the network, he reboots himself as a producer in a five-year deal with Apple TV Plus.
In the 10 months since Richard Plepler stepped down as HBO's chief executive, the final season of "Game of Thrones" came and went, CBS and Viacom merged, and Disney and Apple rolled out new streaming services.
The entertainment world is in flux, and to start the new year, Mr. Plepler is making changes of his own. The gregarious executive, a quintessential New York power player who spent 27 years at HBO and left eight months after AT&T became its owner, is rebooting himself as a producer. And he will do it with Apple.
In a recently signed five-year deal, Mr. Plepler's new company, Eden Productions, will make television series, documentaries and feature films exclusively for Apple TV Plus, the streaming platform that started in November. The arrangement gives Mr. Plepler a significant role in an expanding streaming universe soon to include HBO Max, a supersize platform that has been a focus of his former corporate home since he departed in February after having lost some of his autonomy.
"It was instantaneously clear to me that I had a wonderful and very privileged run at HBO and I wasn't going to be able to duplicate that again," Mr. Plepler said in his first interview since leaving the network. "And I didn't want to try to duplicate that again. It felt very clear to me that I just wanted to do my own thing."
Mr. Plepler, 61, was a key figure in helping make HBO into an original-programming powerhouse. In the years he was in charge, the network won more than 160 Emmys, including for series like "Game of Thrones," "Big Little Lies" and "Veep."
Apple is hopeful he still has the magic touch, this time as a producer. The company has not yet disclosed the number of Apple TV Plus subscribers or how many people have watched its series. Reviews for its first slate of shows have been mixed, even for its big-budget flagship program, "The Morning Show," starring Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston, which landed three Golden Globe nominations, including for best drama.
At Apple, Mr. Plepler has had a longtime admirer in Eddy Cue, the company's senior vice president of internet software and services. Mr. Cue is the executive who hired Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht from Sony's television studio to run Apple's entertainment division.
Mr. Cue and Mr. Plepler worked closely together when Apple and HBO collaborated on the streaming service HBO Now in 2015. And the mix of Apple TV Plus programming reflects HBO's boutique approach, rather than the all-things-to-all-viewers strategy favored by Netflix.
Mr. Plepler said that he had conversations with several people about his next step, but that his only "serious" talks were with Apple. "I thought that Apple was the right idea very quickly, just because it was embryonic enough that I thought maybe, you know, I could make a little contribution there," he said.
A New Yorker through and through, Mr. Plepler intends to provide series and movies for the Cupertino, Calif., company from the second floor of a townhouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which he has been using as his office since August. On a mirror is a taped sign of a Ted Williams quote that he has carted to nearly every office he has inhabited in his long career: "Don't ever let anyone monkey with your swing."
Mr. Cue contacted Mr. Plepler soon after his abrupt departure from HBO.
"As you can imagine, in the days and the first couple weeks after I left, I received an enormous amount of well-wishing calls, and Eddy was among those people," Mr. Plepler said. "He was generous enough to say on that call, 'Look, when you settle down and you think about whatever it is you want to do, know that we're all here and we'll talk."'
In July, Mr. Plepler had a meeting scheduled with Mr. Cue at the Allen & Company Sun Valley conference, an annual gathering of media and technology executives. He planned to broach the idea of producing for Apple, but only if Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht were on board.
The week before the Sun Valley trip, Mr. Plepler had lunch with the two Apple TV Plus executives at the Mark Restaurant, an Upper East Side power-lunch spot at the Mark Hotel run by the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten.
"If they weren't responsive," Mr. Plepler said of Mr. Van Amburg and Mr. Erlicht, "I didn't want to pursue the conversation. And they could not have been both more generous and more enthusiastic. So that was my first conversation. And I followed that up with Eddy in Sun Valley, and we started putting this together."
Mr. Van Amburg said he and Mr. Erlicht welcomed the addition of Mr. Plepler to Apple TV Plus.
"Jamie and I ran a studio for years, and we know how exciting it is to produce and start businesses," he said. "We have a longstanding mutual admiration with Richard, and we're looking forward to helping him build a dynamic production company and seeing him thrive with us at Apple."
One topic Mr. Plepler did not want to discuss in detail: his exit from HBO.
"New people came in and bought the company," he said. "And it was just the right time for me to go on to the next chapter in my life."
When AT&T made its bid for HBO's former corporate parent, Time Warner, in 2016, Mr. Plepler told The New York Times that there needed to be a "Chinese wall" between the premium cable network and the rest of the company. That did not happen.
John Stankey, the veteran AT&T executive who was appointed to oversee the collection of properties now called Warner Media, has made it a mission to knock down the silos between HBO, TNT, TBS and the Warner Bros. film studio.
The executive now in charge of Warner Media's entertainment offerings, Robert Greenblatt, suggested in a December interview with The Hollywood Reporter that HBO cannot afford to stand aloof from the rest of the company, now that streaming has upended the industry. HBO Max, Mr. Greenblatt said, can become a formidable digital player only if it makes room for a broader array of content. HBO Max, which will debut in May with 10,000 hours of programming, is set to include fare that would not have been a fit for the old HBO, shows like the mainstream sitcoms "Friends" and "The Big Bang Theory."
"Look, the dirty little secret is that HBO has hit a ceiling," Mr. Greenblatt said in the interview. "It can't grow. In a world where there's Netflix and Amazon, the only way to grow, I guarantee you, is to bundle it with something else that's going to lift it."
When asked about Mr. Greenblatt's remarks, Mr. Plepler said, "I can't get into that."
And when asked if he had signed an agreement that prevented him from discussing his departure from HBO, he declined to comment. Nor would he entertain the idea that Apple and HBO are now rivals -- although they very much are.
"There is plenty of room out there for everybody to do well and for everybody to produce their version of good content, and I don't think of it for two minutes as rivaling HBO," he said. "I don't think of it that way objectively, and I don't think of it that way emotionally."
Mr. Plepler has set himself apart from other entertainment-industry heavyweights by hobnobbing with politicians and writers, including Christopher Dodd, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Fran Lebowitz, Shimon Peres and David Remnick. In September, he co-hosted a book party for the Times opinion columnist Bari Weiss and a dinner at his home for the Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker. With the Vanity Fair editor Radhika Jones, he also hosted a book party for the former Time magazine managing editor Richard Stengel at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he is a board member.
Although Mr. Plepler is known as an executive, he said repeatedly that he wanted to stick to producing. Invoking the small vessels that torpedoed enemy craft during World War II, he said: "All I want to do, and I mean this at the bottom of my heart, is run my own little PT boat. If I am successful at it as I hope I can be over the coming years, it will be more than enough work for me.
"But I do not want to run anything again," he continued. "I've done that."

Texto completo: A day after a deceptively edited video of him spread on social media, Joseph R. Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.
ANAMOSA, Iowa -- As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.
Mr. Biden's remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.
"You're going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you're going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that's how this guy operates," Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump "if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow" or "if I were to drop dead tomorrow." (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)
Mr. Biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change "our culture" around violence toward women.
Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.
The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a "mosh pit," said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.
Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president's impeachment among some voters -- "Hillary didn't have that advantage" -- and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.
In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.
He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters' lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, "she did what every other candidate probably would have done" by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and "it all went down the drain." Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.
Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called "unfair," but added, "That's not going to happen with me."
It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.
At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: "Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message -- he said he was going to 'make America great again.' What did Hillary Clinton say in response? 'America is already great."'
"That did not quite work," Mr. Yang said. "The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump's solutions were not what we need."
And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.
Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: "Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump," she said to applause.
"I'm in all the way," she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign -- chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.
"What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed," she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump's inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.
"We are getting stronger and we are in this fight," she said. "2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from '16 or '12 or '08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines."
Saying that "the door is open a crack" to an era of major reforms and the end of "business as usual," she added: "Think about it -- a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be."
Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, "Insulting half the country didn't work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won't work for the Democrats in 2020, either."
Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.
"It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement," Mr. Sanders said. "He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump."
Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $ 34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $ 22.7 million -- Mr. Biden's strongest quarter to date -- as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $ 24.7 million.
Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, "Medicare for all." At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.
As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. "That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we're going to win the nomination and why we're going to defeat Donald Trump," he said.
Reporting was contributed by Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens from Concord, N.H.; Sydney Ember from Muscatine, Iowa; and Nick Corasaniti from New York.

Texto completo: As demonstrations over a citizenship law sweep India, more accounts are emerging of mistreatment and harsh tactics by police and state officials.
NAGINA, India -- The teens were trapped.
As the protest broke up, Indian police officers in the town of Nagina chased a group of Muslim teenagers into an empty house. They grabbed them and took them to a makeshift jail. And then, the boys and community leaders said, the officers tortured them.
Four of the boys, who ranged in age from 13 to 17, said in interviews with The New York Times that police officers used wooden canes to beat them and threatened to kill them for taking part in demonstrations against a divisive citizenship law that has fueled rallies and rioting across India. Three had obvious signs of deep bruising or other injuries.
Many Indians fear that the new law, which is seen as a huge political victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist base, is blatantly discriminatory toward Muslims and threatens the very foundation of India as a secular and tolerant nation.
In Uttar Pradesh, the northern Indian state where Nagina is and the one with the most Muslim residents, the rioting has been among the most intense, and the violent backlash from the police has been the most deadly and troubling.
According to accounts by the detained boys in Nagina, along with family members and other officials in their town who spoke to them immediately after they were released, police officers over the course of 30 hours terrorized them and others who had been demonstrating on Dec. 20.
Police officials in the town deny that any abuse happened, or that minors had been detained at all around that time.
According to two of the boys, the officers laughed during beatings, saying, "You will die in this prison."
"They were so scared that hardly anyone could speak," said Khalil-ur-Rehman, a municipal officer in Nagina who met the children at a police station as soon as they were released on Dec. 22. "How do you justify detaining minors, let alone beating them black and blue?"
As the Indian authorities struggle to contain the nationwide protests, more accounts are emerging of abuse meted out by police officers.
According to interviews with more than three dozen people in several Uttar Pradesh towns, almost all the violence has been directed toward Muslim residents. More people -- at least 19 -- have been killed in this state during the protests than anywhere else in India.
Witnesses said that police officers opened fire on demonstrators with live ammunition, broke into houses and stole money, and threatened to rape women. The BBC aired footage showing police officers knocking down security cameras in a Muslim neighborhood and shattering the windows of parked cars.
The Indian news media has reported that Uttar Pradesh police officers were encouraged by their superiors to kill protesters engaged in violence, but that innocent people were also targeted. In one case, officers smacked a 72-year-old Muslim man with a rifle butt, telling him, "Muslims have only two places: Pakistan or the graveyard."
Harsh Mander, a human rights activist who formerly worked in India's civil service, said he visited homes resembling "wastelands," where the police had destroyed kitchens, smashed television sets and threatened to seize property. He said the authorities had interpreted the citizenship law as giving them license to force Muslims into neighboring Pakistan and, as they see it, "settle the unfinished business of Partition."
"The police have become a lynch mob," he said.
Police and state officials have denied using excessive force or singling out Muslims. They have emphasized the need to preserve order and protect innocent people against "radical groups" with "deep-rooted conspiracies" to commit violent acts.
"The kind of action the government is taking against rioters has become an example for the entire country," read a Friday tweet from the office of Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh's chief minister and a close ally of Mr. Modi.
But many residents accuse Uttar Pradesh officials of mounting an organized campaign to terrify Muslims into submission. The new citizenship bill, which creates a special path for non-Muslim migrants in India to receive citizenship, has provoked the biggest backlash Mr. Modi has faced since becoming prime minister in 2014.
In Uttar Pradesh, where destructive riots erupted and protesters vandalized property, there is a growing number of accounts of police officers having been given the green light by senior officials to use harsh measures.
In an audio recording that some residents and officials say features the voice of Sanjeev Tyagi, the superintendent of police in the Bijnor district, which includes Nagina, a man orders police officers to "break the arms and legs of those throwing stones at police stations."
"Go and fix them," he said.
Mr. Tyagi looked surprised and a bit disturbed when asked, during an interview with The New York Times, about this recording. He declined to say whether his was the voice on the recording, which one officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, said had been radioed out to the police force. Since then it has been widely shared on social media.
After India's Parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act on Dec. 11, hundreds of thousands of protesters poured into the streets in many cities across the country to oppose the law, which favors every major South Asian faith over Islam.
Mr. Modi has defended the law, saying that it would not strip citizenship from India's Muslims and that it was intended to help religious minorities fleeing persecution in neighboring Muslim-majority countries. He said those protesting the bill were "spreading lies."
On Dec. 19, Mr. Adityanath, a monk and staunch Hindu nationalist, publicly urged the state police to "take revenge" on protesters who were vandalizing public property. Mr. Adityanath has called Muslims "a crop of two-legged animals that has to be stopped." During his tenure as chief minister, the state police have killed dozens of suspects in altercations known in India as police "encounters."
On the afternoon of Dec. 20, as Friday Prayer ended and people began to hit the streets across Uttar Pradesh to protest the citizenship bill, violence exploded in several towns at the same time. Thousands of officers were deployed.
At the Jama mosque in Nagina, protesters soon found themselves surrounded by the police. More than a hundred were detained and bused to an empty badminton court, where they were beaten with bamboo canes, witnesses said.
At least 21 teenagers were among the group, according to the four boys who were interviewed. Adult family members were with them during the interviews.
One of the detainees, a 15-year-old boy who showed reporters deep bruises on his leg, said police officers seemed most provoked by those who did not initially cry.
"Everyone was screaming," said the boy, whose identity is being withheld because he is a minor and fears punishment by officials. "They forced us to drink bottles of water and then they would beat us when we asked to go to the bathroom."
Another detainee, a 16-year-old with a bandaged hand that he believed had been broken, said that a few police officers had tried to stop the abuse but were outnumbered. He said officers seemed to enjoy depriving them of sleep and making them cold.
In the interview, Mr. Tyagi, the police superintendent for the Bijnor district, denied that minors were among the people detained then, calling those reports "totally baseless."
Mr. Tyagi stated that protesters in Nagina had gotten out of control, posing a risk. He shared videos that showed protesters rampaging in Bijnor's business district, breaking store windows and vandalizing a vehicle that he said belonged to a Hindu man. Police officials said that at least 288 officers statewide were injured, including 61 from gunshot wounds.
"We were worried that Hindus and Muslims were about to fight each other," Mr. Tyagi said, pointing to the state's long, bloody history of such riots.
Many of these towns are now filled with grief. The family of Mohammed Suleman, a young man fatally shot in a protest on Dec. 20, still can't believe he is gone.
Sitting in Mr. Suleman's bedroom, a concrete shell filled with books, Mr. Suleman's uncle, Anwar Usmani, broke down as he spoke about the boy, who he said woke up every day at 5 a.m. to study for the Indian civil service exam.
"He wanted to serve the country that killed him," Mr. Usmani said.
Mr. Suleman's family said that they had to beg police officials to give back his body after their vehicle was stopped on their way back home to the town of Nehtaur from a nearby city, where they had sought a doctor to try to save him.
Family members who had been in the vehicle said that Mahaveer Singh Rajawat, a law enforcement official for Nehtaur, pointed a gun at their chests and told them: "Behave and be silent, or I will declare that those who died were terrorists!" Mr. Suleman's body was returned to them, but they were threatened by the police not to try to rouse public sympathy by publicly displaying it.
When asked about this during an interview with The Times, Mr. Rajawat abruptly left his office and drove away in a jeep. Mr. Tyagi, the superintendent of police, said he was not aware of these accusations.
Surrounded by mourning women, Mr. Suleman's mother, Akbari Khatoon, rocked on her bed and wailed.
"The police killed him in cold blood," she said, "and that is what the world should know."

Texto completo: A reader says speaking at an impeachment trial of Donald Trump would show that the former vice president has nothing to hide. Also: The death of the publishing legend Sonny Mehta.
To the Editor:
Re "Changing Course, Biden Now Says He'd Comply if Subpoenaed" (news article, Dec. 29):
It is a positive sign that Joe Biden has stated that he would comply with a subpoena issued in any impeachment trial in the Senate. But he should take a further step; he should demand to be called to testify.
The House Republicans continually complained that Mr. Biden was not called to testify. Here is the opportunity for him to be heard.
Mr. Biden's testimony would serve two purposes. He could use the process to clear his name of the false allegations that have been levied against him. And it would show the country that, unlike the Republicans who refuse to call the witnesses that Senator Chuck Schumer has named, the Democrats have nothing to hide.
It is time to expose Senator Mitch McConnell for the manipulative politician that he is. Mr. Biden can do just that.

Remembering Sonny Mehta
To the Editor:
Re "Sonny Mehta, Knopf's Guru of the Bookshelves, Is Dead at 77" (obituaries, Jan. 1):
Sonny Mehta was my first editor. We sat in his New York City apartment for two days, going through the manuscript of my first novel, "The Flamingo Rising." Line by line, almost word by word. I learned more about the writing process in those two days than I had before or have since.
At one point, after we had quibbled about another one of his "suggestions," I got exasperated. "Sonny, with all these problems, why did you even buy the book?" He took a puff of his cigarette and said, "Because I saw a wonderful story with a lot of sloppy writing getting in the way."

A Splashy Start to Prohibition, 100 Not-So-Dry Januaries Ago

Texto completo: In 1920, Prohibition went into effect, but America partied on.
As the sun rose this morning on a new year, bleary-eyed people across the United States poured out their half-drunk champagne bottles, gathered up their empty beer cans and turned to Twitter to share their resolution with the world.
Dry January has begun.
For those experimenting with temporary sobriety, there is pride in abstention. These droughts are self-imposed and finite -- and come with social media bragging rights. But the last time we entered a decade known as the '20s, Americans were staring down the barrel of a government-mandated dry spell, with no end in sight. For those who partook of the hard stuff, this first dry January was greeted not with determination and #goals but with denial and despair.
Prohibition is most closely associated with the 1920s, but its seeds were planted a century earlier, when the national temperance movement began decrying alcohol as the root cause of societal evils including laziness, promiscuity and poverty. Eliminate the drink, they said, and Americans will be a happier, healthier and more prosperous people.
The movement gained traction around the turn of the century, in large part thanks to women's groups who saw temperance as a way to combat domestic violence. On Jan. 16, 1919 -- more than a year before women could vote nationwide -- the teetotalers achieved their ultimate goal: The Eighteenth Amendment, prohibiting the "manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating liquors" anywhere within the United States, was ratified.
The country had one year to prepare.
"Nobody believed it would happen," David Wondrich, the cocktail historian, said. "Prohibition was a small-town, rural movement, and people in the cities resented it. They really thought until the very end that there was going to be a way out of it, and then, suddenly, it became clear there wasn't."
In October 1919, over President Woodrow Wilson's veto, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act -- more commonly known as the Volstead Act, for its mustachioed champion, Representative Andrew Volstead of Minnesota -- to provide for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment. The law was set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 17, 1920.
While the amendment specifically forbid purchasing or transporting alcohol, it said nothing about drinking alcohol you already had in your home. Boozehounds quickly seized upon this loophole. As businesses hustled to offload their soon-to-be illegal inventory, there was a mad dash for hooch.
"Fair ladies sat in limousines behind alluring barricades of cases; business men in runabouts had cases on their knees," The San Francisco Chronicle reported. "On every face was stamped that extraordinary and inexplicable expression of triumph mingled with apprehension which the possession of an irreplaceable treasure in a predicament of extraordinary peril is wont to imbue."
It was impossible to buy enough liquor to last a lifetime, but people tried, said Daniel Okrent, the author of "Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition." In Hollywood, he said, "Mary Pickford's mom bought the contents of an entire liquor store."
What businesses couldn't sell off in bulk, they splashed out at parties, beginning with a particularly raucous New Year's Eve and continuing right up until the last midnight, 16 days later.
"Every big cafe in New York City was having a party," Mr. Wondrich, the historian, said of the night of Jan. 16. "There were so many corks popping, it sounded like artillery fire." Some of the restaurants even held mock funerals marking the death of alcohol.
Prohibition approached like "the Fifth Horseman of the Apocalypse," The New York Herald reported. "But, oh, how New York City's Great Glittering Way did drink and feast before he came! And even after he had arrived and kicked the sides of his nag and made his way over the city, there was mirth enough and song enough and mockery enough to make him tremble in his dull, black boots."
Eventually the mirth ebbed, the champagne ran dry and Americans were left to stagger home into a new age.
"The last day has come and gone -- the inevitable hour," The Chronicle wrote in its eulogy for booze. "At midnight all that was lawful about the spirit that cheereth and the red, red wine passed out of existence." The New York Times took a cheekier approach with its front page headline: "John Barleycorn Died Peacefully at the Toll of 12."
The nation was officially bone dry. But unofficially, wet spots were everywhere, if you knew how to look.
Bootlegging operations popped up almost immediately, leading government enforcers in a yearslong game of Whack-a-Mole. And flower shops, parking garages and basement apartments were repurposed into illicit watering holes, better known as speakeasies.
Like most things, though, one's ability to drink came down to means, according to Mr. Wondrich. If you could afford to go to fancy places, you could get the same beverages as before -- only instead of 15 cents, they would now set you back a dollar. Drinking culture flourished, in spite of its being verboten. Classic cocktails like the sidecar, the bee's knees and the French 75 all made their debut during Prohibition, Mr. Wondrich said.
There were those who tried to adapt to the dry age. Many breweries found other ways to make use of their equipment: Pabst went into cheese, Yuengling and Anheuser-Busch into ice cream and Coors, in clay-rich Colorado, invested in ceramics.
As for the saloons, some experimented with juices and nonalcoholic mixed drinks. There were a few successes -- one boozeless cocktail created during Prohibition is known today in its spiked form as the Bloody Mary -- but for the most part, the concoctions were disappointing facsimiles that "just made you sad," Mr. Wondrich said.
"Just trying to mimic spirits and classic cocktails is a recipe for failure," explained Julia Bainbridge, the author of the forthcoming nonalcoholic cocktail recipe book, "Good Drinks." Instead of trying to replicate the specific flavor of a negroni, you should "consider what a negroni feels like," she added.
"It's that tension between salty and sour and sweet and bitter that pleases the human palate," she said. "And that experience can be delivered without alcohol, with the same level of complexity, but you have to put a lot of labor into it. Basically, if you want to get something that's not just a tiki-derivative sugar bomb, you're going to have to cook."
Prohibition officially ended with the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment in 1933. By then, however, the legal change was mostly a formality.
"There were breweries on the West Side of Manhattan making 200,000 gallons of beer a week," Mr. Wondrich said. "The scale of industry was so insane that the law became a joke."
Nowadays, there are bars in every big city that style themselves as Prohibition-era speakeasies, and the age's spirit has proved enduring.
"It's that notion of doing something that's against the law but not evil," Mr. Okrent, the author, said. "There's fun in defying authority."
In the past 15 years, there has also been a revival of the cocktail boom that characterized Prohibition -- this time with increasingly complex and delicious options for non-drinkers, too.
After all, life is too short for bad drinks. That goes whether you're partaking of booze or abstaining from it -- for a month, for life or even just for the night.

Texto completo: Three readers rebut an Op-Ed article that was critical of A.A. "Walking into my first A.A. meeting was the single bravest thing I have ever done," one writes.
To the Editor:
Re "The Patriarchy of Alcoholics Anonymous," by Holly Whitaker (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):
For anyone who has attended more than a handful of A.A. meetings, Ms. Whitaker's opinion that the organization is patriarchal makes little sense. While it was founded by a group of men nearly a century ago, today's A.A. is nonhierarchical and run by diverse groups of neighborhood volunteers, including many women.
Moreover, Ms. Whitaker mischaracterizes the central tenet of A.A.'s philosophy entirely when she writes that it is designed to break people down. To the contrary, it raises people up through group therapy and community support.
To support her argument, Ms. Whitaker cavalierly claims that one of the 12 steps is "admitting powerlessness" but conveniently fails to explain that the step is actually "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol and that our lives had become unmanageable," which changes the meaning of the phrase entirely. Going to A.A. is not a sign of weakness in any sense.
Indeed, walking into my first A.A. meeting was the single bravest thing I have ever done. I was in a terrible emotional place and I shared my story, publicly breaking into tears. The outpouring of support that I received from the others moves me to this day. Random people gave me their phone numbers and made sure to take mine. They called and texted me for weeks just to make sure I was doing O.K. The experience will renew your faith in humanity.
Through self-knowledge and community support, I am happy and sober today. And I will always be appreciative of the kind, loving, selfless volunteers of Alcoholics Anonymous who helped me get that way.

To the Editor:
Holly Whitaker's blithe takedown of Alcoholics Anonymous does a grave disservice to millions in this country desperate to quit drinking or using, but too paralyzed by fear and shame to ask for help. Ms. Whitaker has given them an easy excuse to cross A.A. off their list of potential resources.
Most egregiously, she doesn't mention that thousands of women-only A.A. groups meet every day in this country, started and run by women whose distaste for patriarchy is as fierce as Ms. Whitaker's. There are also men-only meetings, gay-only meetings, Spanish-speaking meetings, meetings at 5 a.m., noon and midnight, meetings where everybody has a graduate degree and meetings with junkies nodding off in the corner, meetings with nobody over 20 and meetings with nobody under 65. This diversity reflects A.A.'s flexibility and ability to respond to cultural change.
Many things about A.A. irk, from the stilted 1930s syntax of its literature to its temperature-challenged (but no longer smoke-filled) church-basement meeting spaces. A.A. is not so much an organization as it is a network of affiliates, so you are free to walk out of a meeting that doesn't work for you and find one that does.
Inside whatever meeting you wind up at, you'll find compassionate people who know exactly how torn up you feel inside and whose only goal is to help you figure out how to start repairing the damage.
R.W. Greene

To the Editor:
I am a feminist and an alcoholic sober 35 years. My life was a disaster and I could not quit drinking. Alcoholics Anonymous has done for me what I could not do for myself. By working through the 12 steps with other people like me, I was able to finally stop drinking and become the best version of myself.
Holly Whitaker missed the point. Being spiritual does not mean giving in to a patriarchal structure. It means letting go of the need to control. The irony is that when I stop fighting my ego, I am able to find my deepest power as a woman living in a patriarchal world. If women in A.A. were "expected to blame themselves, follow instructions and fall into line in a patriarchal society," I'd have left long ago.
There is no one "right" way to do anything. Drunken women will never be able to change the patriarchy. We need to be sober and healthy to do that.

Texto completo: Mark Galli, who is retiring, was overwhelmed by the vocal criticism and quiet praise after his editorial in a prominent evangelical magazine called for President Trump's ouster.
People have been upset with Mark Galli before. As the editor in chief of Christianity Today, a prominent evangelical magazine, he has printed some controversial editorials. But the people he irks usually do not include the IT department of his own publication.
That is what happened when Mr. Galli published an explosive editorial on Dec. 19 arguing that President Trump should be removed from office. So many readers flocked to read the editorial online that the website crashed, overwhelming those whose job it was to keep it running.
Mr. Galli had been working for Christianity Today for two decades after being a Presbyterian pastor for about 10 years, first in Mexico City and later in Sacramento, Calif., but the response to the editorial was like nothing he had ever seen. The traffic to the website was 50-fold what it is on a typical day.
Mr. Galli's last day with the magazine will be Friday. He had announced his retirement in October, long before the editorial and the response to it.
In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, he said he was shocked by the magnitude of the reaction to the editorial -- but also by evangelicals' willingness to stick by Mr. Trump for more than three years. The interview has been edited and condensed.
Did you ever expect the sort of reaction this editorial received?
Not in the least. On a very viral article, we might get 4,000 or 5,000 on the site at one time. Not only did this crash the site almost immediately, but when it came back on, there were between 15 and 17,000 people on our site for hours. I've kind of gotten in trouble with my IT department because they said, "Why didn't you give us a heads up?" and I said, "I had no idea."
Friday I came into the office, and the desk phone we're speaking on now literally rang -- this is not hyperbole -- all day, and I did not pick it up once because I was also getting messages by email, text messages and calls on my cellphone.
There was quite a bit of criticism from evangelicals and others of the piece. What did you make of that opposition?
I was a little surprised that Donald Trump and then Franklin Graham thought it was worth commenting on. And it did strike me as a bit ironic that they both said that it wasn't significant or going to make any difference. It makes you immediately think that they do think it's significant, or they wouldn't comment on it.
I suppose the thing that was most surprising, and which I'm still trying to wrap my head around, was the positive response. People wrote to me and said they had felt all alone and were waiting for someone in the evangelical leadership to say what the editorial said. I wish I could tell you that I had noticed that and wanted to respond to it, but I didn't see that. There were a lot of people who were feeling alone and they're not feeling that way now.
Despite that, of course, evangelicals as a bloc largely support President Trump. Is there anything Trump could do to lose that support?
I've been surprised by the ethical naïveté of the response I'm receiving to the editorial. There does seem to be widespread ignorance -- that is the best word I can come up with -- of the gravity of Trump's moral failings. Some evangelicals will acknowledge he had a problem with adultery, but now they consider that a thing of the past. They bring up King David, but the difference is King David repented! Donald Trump has not done that.
Some evangelicals say he is prideful, abrasive and arrogant -- which are all the qualities that Christians decry -- but they don't seem to grasp how serious it is for a head of state to talk like that and it does make me wonder what's going on there.
Do you think evangelicals' willingness to excuse Mr. Trump's behavior will translate to a more broad willingness to forgive bad behavior by politicians, or does it seem to be Trump-specific?
I think his supporters would say it is limited to Trump. But I will say that some of his closest followers are, in a sense, being discipled by him. Mr. Trump's typical response to a critic is to frame the entire conversation as a competition between success and failure. When the editorial published, the first response coming out of the mouth of some leading evangelicals was "That's Christianity Yesterday" or "You're a dying magazine." They're taking their cues on how to react in the public square from Donald Trump, whose basic response is to denigrate people.
What's next for you? Do you plan to engage more with politics?
I'm planning to take advantage of the benefits of retirement: more time with my grandchildren, more time on the stream to do fly-fishing. If I can use religious language to talk about this, it does seem like providence has intervened in my life and made sure I'm not going to relax for the next few months.
I was planning to continue to write and comment, and this just put an exclamation point on it. I feel like I need to keep talking about things on my website and I've already been invited to write for The Los Angeles Times and The Guardian and I'm going to do that. I'm going to write as honestly and as charitably as I can about the movement that I've been a part of for 50 years.
Have your views about Mr. Trump changed since 2016? And who did you vote for then?
Like many, I was not happy with either candidate, and so I voted for a third-party candidate. And you're about to ask me who that is, and I don't remember. The most important thing is, I didn't want to vote for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump.
We published one hard-hitting editorial in 2016 asking if voters had fallen into the sin of idolatry. After Trump was elected, I spent the first three years of his administration just trying to understand why conservatives and why very conservative evangelicals would vote for him and support him so enthusiastically.
The right and the left clearly wanted to excommunicate each other from the movement, so whenever I had the opportunity, I tried to get evangelicals on the left, center and right to have a reasonable conversation. I wanted to continue that when I sat down to write the editorial, but something in me clicked and I thought: That approach doesn't work anymore. Given what we now know about what the president has done, we need to speak out more directly about this.
Do you view politics or religion differently than you did before Mr. Trump's presidency?
I'm actually not a political person. I don't follow political reporting too much. I find it caustic, both to the culture and to one's own heart. I often say the most political things Christians do is, every Sunday, go to church and say "Jesus Christ is Lord."
I've been thinking more deeply about what the relationship is between Christian faith and political life. I had drawn much more of a separation between politics and faith in my past, and I need to rethink that. I certainly don't want to do what mainstream Christianity has done and make politics indistinguishable from faith -- especially on the left, and now on the right. But is there a way to talk about our nation's issues that is not merely partisan, but raises questions of ethics and morality and ideals?

Texto completo: In the attack in November, a Hasidic Jewish man was stabbed and slashed as he walked to synagogue in a New York suburb.
The police are actively exploring whether a man accused of storming into a Hasidic rabbi's home and stabbing five people at a Hanukkah celebration last week in a New York City suburb was also involved in another stabbing near a synagogue a month earlier, officials said on Thursday.
Chief Brad Weidel of the Ramapo Police Department, which is overseeing both investigations, said that detectives were looking at possible links between the two attacks but that the man, Grafton E. Thomas, was not yet a suspect in the November one. Both attacks occurred in Monsey, N.Y., located about 30 miles northwest of New York City.
Within days of the chilling stabbing in November, when an Orthodox Jewish man was attacked as he walked to his synagogue, officers had interviewed Mr. Thomas, according to Chief Weidel. But investigators, who had tied Mr. Thomas to a vehicle similar to the one they believed might have been used, did not have evidence to directly connect him to the attack.
After Mr. Thomas, of Greenwood Lake, N.Y., was arrested last Saturday and charged with being responsible for a bloody rampage that horrified people across the country, a detective recognized his name from the earlier investigation and decided to re-examine the possibility that he had been involved.
"We get a name, and the detectives go, 'Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy we interviewed from Greenwood Lake?"' Chief Weidel said at a news conference at Ramapo's town hall.
On a conference call with reporters, Mr. Thomas's lawyer, Michael Sussman, said that he had not investigated whether Mr. Thomas was connected to the November attack and could not comment on it.
The attack in November rattled the Jewish community in Rockland County, a suburban area northwest of New York City that is believed to have one of the largest concentrations of ultra-Orthodox Jews outside of Israel.
At around 5:30 a.m. on Nov. 20, a Hasidic Jewish man was headed to a synagogue on Howard Drive for morning prayers, when a car stopped and at least one man attacked him, officials said.
The victim in that attack survived, but the November case remained unsolved. For weeks, the authorities have shied away from calling it a hate crime despite pressure from Jewish community leaders, saying they have not collected enough evidence to determine a motive.
Since then, tension and anxiety among the area's Orthodox community has only increased after a string of anti-Semitic attacks in the region, including a mass shooting at a kosher supermarket in Jersey City, N.J., that killed two Hasidic Jews, among others, as well as a string of anti-Semitic crimes in Brooklyn and the stabbing in Monsey.
The police investigating the November attack had obtained surveillance video that showed the vehicle that might have been involved. The video was not high-quality, Chief Weidel said, so detectives showed the footage to area auto-body shops, where workers said the car was a Honda Pilot.
A detective then discovered that a Honda Pilot had been in nearby Clarkstown about two and a half hours before the stabbing, according to Chief Weidel. That vehicle was registered to Mr. Thomas's mother, Kim Kennedy, who told officers that her son had driven the car that night, Chief Weidel said.
Ms. Kennedy told the police that Mr. Thomas "likes to go driving around at night" and that it was not unusual for him to be driving around at 3 a.m., Chief Weidel said. Ms. Kennedy told reporters on Thursday that when she spoke with the police then, she was not aware they were investigating the November attack.
The police subsequently spoke with Mr. Thomas, Chief Weidel said. He told them that he had been in Clarkstown, about 30 miles from his home, because the car had "mechanical problems."
When detectives examined the car, they found nothing to suggest that it had been on Howard Drive or that it had been involved in the attack, Chief Weidel said.
The police have since obtained a federal search warrant for the Honda Pilot, Chief Weidel said. It was in the authorities' hands as of Thursday, and they were examining it for any evidence that might connect it to the November attack.
Mr. Thomas, who is said to be 37 or 38, remains in custody in the Rockland County jail, according to Mr. Sussman.
According to a federal criminal complaint, officers found both a bloody machete and a bloody knife in Mr. Thomas's car -- a different vehicle from the Honda Pilot -- when he was arrested in Harlem, about 30 miles from Monsey, with blood on his clothes, officials said.
Mr. Thomas has pleaded not guilty to five counts of state charges of attempted murder. A grand jury in Rockland County is expected to consider the charges against him on Friday morning.
Federal prosecutors have also filed five hate crime charges, accusing Mr. Thomas of obstructing the free exercise of religion in an attempt to kill. In a criminal complaint, they said that Mr. Thomas made written references to Hitler and "Nazi culture" in journals, and that he repeatedly searched online for information on local temples and on topics such as "Why did Hitler hate the Jews?"
Mr. Thomas pleaded not guilty to the federal charges. His family, friends and lawyer said that he had suffered from mental illness but that he had no history of anti-Semitism.
Four of the victims in the Hanukkah attack were released from area hospitals. The fifth, Josef Neumann, 72, remained unconscious as of Thursday afternoon, his relatives said at a news conference.
"The doctors do not have high hopes for him," said his daughter, Nicky Kohen. "If he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again."

Texto completo: The killing of the powerful commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps is certain to reignite a debate over presidential war powers.
WASHINGTON -- The killing of the powerful commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, in a drone strike on Friday sharply divided congressional leaders along party lines and reignited a debate over whether Congress should curtail the president's war powers.
The strike, which the Pentagon said President Trump ordered and was "aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans," was a significant escalation in the administration's pressure campaign against Tehran.
"This particular scenario is one that I've thought about for many years and it is one that could very well lead to the type of violence and chaos that we've been so desperately trying to keep ourselves out of," said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey and the former director for Iraq on President Barack Obama's National Security Council "The coming hours and days will be very important."
According to Speaker Nancy Pelosi the strike was carried out "without the consultation of Congress."
"American leaders' highest priority is to protect American lives and interests," Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. "But we cannot put the lives of American service members, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions. Tonight's airstrike risks provoking further dangerous escalation of violence."
Republican lawmakers praised the president for the strike, saying that Mr. Trump had brought justice to scores of American military families. United States officials considered General Suleimani, the commander of the Revolutionary Guards' elite Quds Force, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war as well as for hostile Iranian activities throughout the Middle East.
"His death presents an opportunity for Iraq to determine its own future free from Iranian control," said Senator Jim Risch of Idaho, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. "As I have previously warned the Iranian government, they should not mistake our reasonable restraint in response to their previous attacks as weakness."
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said on Twitter that Mr. Trump had "exercised admirable restraint while setting clear red lines & the consequences for crossing them."
The Quds, Mr. Rubio tweeted, "are entirely to blame for bringing about the dangerous moment now before us."
But Democrats worried about the consequences of the strike.
Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, called General Suleimani an "enemy of the United States with American blood on his hands."
"But the question we've grappled with for years in Iraq was how to kill more terrorists than we create," Mr. Moulton said in a statement. "That's an open question tonight as we await Iran's reaction to Donald Trump's escalation, which could ignite a regional war, with still no strategy from the administration."
Other lawmakers, like Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico, accused Mr. Trump of bringing the nation "to the brink of an illegal war with Iran."
"Such a reckless escalation of hostilities is likely a violation of Congress's war-making authority -- as well as our basing agreement with Iraq -- putting U.S. forces and citizens in danger," Mr. Udall said in a statement, "and very possibly sinking us into another disastrous war in the Middle East that the American people are not asking for and do not support."
Mr. Udall, as part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers, had fought last year to pass a measure that would have required Mr. Trump to get Congress's permission before striking Iran. But the resolution, which would have needed Mr. Trump's signature, was jettisoned by the Senate in June. Another attempt to squeeze the amendment into the National Defense Authorization Act, the must-pass annual defense bill, was stripped out of the final version of the legislation.
"Any member who voted for the N.D.A.A. -- a blank check -- can't now express dismay that Trump may have launched another war in the Middle East," said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California and one of the sponsors of the measure. "Our Congress let our nation down again by failing to stand up against a war in Iran."

Texto completo: Larsen's singular accomplishment, a perfect game in the 1956 World Series, is a testament to the whims of the baseball gods.
The ultimate pitching achievement comes with no warning. For a while, even as a perfect game unfolds, nobody suspects a thing. On Oct. 8, 1956, the fifth game of the World Series was halfway over before the visiting team at Yankee Stadium realized that Don Larsen, of all people, had a chance.
"It was probably the end of the fifth inning that somebody on the bench said, 'Do you know we haven't had a base runner yet?"' said Carl Erskine, a Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher, over the phone this summer. "And everybody kind of woke up and said, 'No, really?'
"So everybody started watching close, but we didn't expect Larsen to beat us -- and we never went into the game thinking, 'This is the greatest pitcher that ever put on the uniform."'
Larsen, who died on Wednesday at age 90, was hardly the greatest pitcher ever. He played for seven teams in 14 seasons, with 81 victories and 91 defeats. A year after his perfect game, he lost Game 7 of the World Series to the Milwaukee Braves.
Yet all these years later, Larsen's 2-0 masterpiece for the Yankees in 1956 remains a singular phenomenon in baseball history. No pitcher has carried even a no-hitter into the ninth inning of a World Series game since; the closest, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was Boston's Jim Lonborg, who no-hit the St. Louis Cardinals for seven and two-thirds innings in Game 2 in 1967.
Larsen lived the rest of his life as a baseball legend, his name among the most hallowed in the history of the sport.
"I mean, it was 'perfect game' -- you never even looked at his stats over his career," Joe Torre, the Hall of Fame manager, said by phone on Thursday. "And a perfect game is one thing, but to do it in the World Series is certainly another level of excellence. It's like, when you think of Ron Swoboda, you think of his catch in right-center field in 1969, diving with no chance to catch the ball -- and he did. You look at his numbers and say, 'O.K., nothing that's startling.' But when something happens in the World Series, you're always going to hold it in high regard."
Torre was in the stands for Larsen's perfect game. He was 16 years old and had hoped to be watching his brother Frank, a rookie with the Braves, who had been beaten out by the Dodgers for the pennant. On the morning of the game, Torre showed his ticket to the principal at St. Francis Preparatory School in Brooklyn and got the rest of the day off. He does not remember who went with him that day, but he knows he sat in the upper deck between third base and the left-field foul pole.
"I remember that part because you remember your perspective of watching the game," Torre said. "Mickey Mantle was sort of running in my direction when he caught the ball off Gil Hodges's bat."
Mantle's catch was one of two close calls in the fifth inning; the other was a deep drive to right field by Sandy Amoros that hooked foul. The pinch-hitter Dale Mitchell batted last, and Torre recalled the plate umpire, Babe Pinelli, punching the air with his right fist for the final out. Larsen trotted casually off the mound until his catcher, Yogi Berra, vaulted into his arms.
"It's funny, leaping into the pitcher's arms is something I'd never done before," Berra wrote for The New York Times in 1998. "Once I jumped on Bob Kuzava after he saved the 1952 World Series for us, but he had his back turned."
Berra called Larsen "Ol' Gooney Bird," and said he sometimes had to work to keep him focused during games. News media reports of the perfect game played up Larsen's personality; "Clown Prince ascends the throne," said a headline in The Star-Ledger of Newark. Jimmy Cannon, the renowned Newsday columnist, called Larsen "a midnight kid who doesn't miss many laughs."
The Daily Mirror's Arthur Richman -- later a club executive who encouraged the Yankees to hire Torre -- was friends with Larsen and went out with him the night before the perfect game. For years, the avuncular Richman would tell the story of how he urged Larsen to take it easy, just in case he pitched the next day.
"God love him," Torre said, laughing. "I can just hear Arthur saying, 'Donnie, Donnie, you should get some sleep, Donnie."'
Larsen must have had a lot on his mind. The day of the perfect game, his estranged wife, Vivian, asked the State Supreme Court to hold up his World Series winnings in an alimony dispute. A court order over unpaid child support was said to have been in Larsen's locker as he pitched; newspapers called him a playboy.
By the end of his career, though, Larsen had settled into a role as an elder statesman. He logged time with the Athletics, the White Sox, the Giants, the Astros, the Orioles and the Cubs. He faced the Yankees as a Giants reliever in the 1962 World Series, and helped mentor a young Jim Palmer with Baltimore three years later.
"He was a huge guy, very soft-spoken, a really nice man," Palmer, the Hall of Fame pitcher, said by phone on Thursday, recalling a time when Manager Hank Bauer called Larsen into a game at Yankee Stadium, only to realize he had summoned the wrong pitcher.
"Nine years earlier he'd pitched the greatest game in the history of the World Series, and now he comes in and Hank says, 'No I don't want you, you've got to go back to the bullpen,"' Palmer said. "But he was the type of guy -- it didn't bother him. He was a gentle giant."
Palmer starred on the mound in the 1970s, a decade in which no pitcher threw a perfect game. The feat has been accomplished only 23 times, and Larsen's was the only one between 1922 (Charlie Robertson) and 1964 (Jim Bunning).
Two other Yankees -- David Wells in 1998 and David Cone in 1999 -- have done it, and Larsen had a connection to both. Larsen and Wells both attended Point Loma High School in San Diego, and Larsen threw the ceremonial first pitch to Berra on the day of Cone's gem.
"Coney pitched his in July and Wells pitched his in May," Torre said, "and if it was reversed, neither one of them probably would have done it, because Coney needed the warm weather to stay loose and Wells needed the cool weather to keep from getting exhausted. The stars have to be aligned, I guess."
Seven Hall of Famers have pitched a perfect game, but so have seven pitchers with a sub-.500 career record. Larsen's day stands out above all, a testament to the enchanting whims of the baseball gods.
"If somebody's a baseball fan, you can explain to your child that on one autumn afternoon in Yankee Stadium, in under two and a half hours, Don Larsen, who would be 10 games under .500, would pitch the most memorable game in the history of the World Series," Palmer said. "That's what baseball's all about."

The Dodgers never expected to lose to Larsen, who said that even he didn't realize he had a perfect game until it was over. "It's funny," Yogi Berra would later write for The Times, "leaping into the pitcher's arms is something I'd never done before."

Texto completo: Our guide to the city's best classical music and opera happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
'BLOOD MOON' at the Baruch Performing Arts Center (Jan. 9, 7:30 p.m.; through Jan. 17). The essential Prototype festival opens with the premiere of this opera by the composer Garrett Fisher and the librettist Ellen McLaughlin. The piece blends music, choreography and puppetry in response to a 15th-century Noh play. Steven Osgood conducts a cast of three, with Juecheng Chen as the Moon, Nina Yoshida Nelsen as the Aunt and Wei Wu as the Nephew.

HERE AND NOW WINTER FESTIVAL at Bargemusic (Jan. 3, 7 p.m.; Jan. 4, 6 p.m.; Jan. 5, 4 p.m.). These three identical programs in Bargemusic's periodic new-music celebration -- as sprawling as ever -- include works by Eric Moe, Takuma Itoh, Maya Miro Johnson, Veronika Krausas, Lev Zhurbin, Adolphus Hailstork, David Taylor and Kevin Puts, whose "Aria" for cello and piano is just one of several premieres on the bill.
800-838-3006, bargemusic.org
NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC at David Geffen Hall (Jan. 3-4, 8 p.m.; Jan. 7, 7:30 p.m.). Jeffrey Kahane leads the first subscription program of the new year, through Tuesday, conducting Haydn's Symphony No. 96, Respighi's "Trittico botticelliano" and Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 22, in which Kahane is also the soloist. Later in the coming week, from Jan. 9 to 11, Daniel Harding returns to the podium for the first time since 2011, conducting Strauss's "Eine Alpensinfonie" and Grieg's Piano Concerto, with Paul Lewis at the keyboard.

PARKER QUARTET AND ANTHONY MCGILL at Advent Lutheran Church (Jan. 6, 7:30 p.m.). Part of the free Music Monday series, this concert pairs Harvard's quartet in residence with McGill, the principal clarinetist of the New York Philharmonic, for Mozart's Clarinet Quintet. Then the quartet will perform Esa-Pekka Salonen's "Homunculus" and Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 9.
musicmondays.org
'PORGY AND BESS' at the Metropolitan Opera (Jan. 8, 7:30 p.m.; through Feb. 15). James Robinson's sell-out production of Gershwin's classic has proved so popular that the Met has added three performances to this second run of the season. Much of the same cast returns from the premiere, albeit with one or two substitutions on certain dates. Kevin Short is Porgy (Eric Owens resumes the role starting on Jan. 15), with Angel Blue as Bess, Janai Brugger as Clara, Latonia Moore as Serena, Denyce Graves as Maria, Frederick Ballentine as Sportin' Life, Alfred Walker as Crown and Donovan Singletary as Jake. David Robertson conducts.

Texto completo: "Ilana Glazer: The Planet is Burning" hits Amazon. And the 1994 adaptation of "Little Women" airs on Showtime Showcase.
What's Streaming
ILANA GLAZER: THE PLANET IS BURNING Stream on Amazon. The coming-of-age New York sitcom "Broad City" made stars of its creators, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson. About a year after wrapping up that show, Glazer is taking a solo turn with this stand-up special, which includes sharp observations on anti-Semitism, sexism and homophobia. She also discusses married life and, briefly, the Alfred Hitchcock classic "Rear Window" ("It was fine," she decrees, before doing a bit on Grace Kelly's voice).
THE KID (2019) Stream on Amazon and Hulu. Ethan Hawke plays the Old West Sheriff Pat Garrett on the hunt for Billy the Kid (Dane DeHaan) in this Western, which centers on a pair of young siblings who get caught in the middle of that hunt. The movie's best quality by far, Jeannette Catsoulis said in her review for The New York Times, is Matthew J. Lloyd's cinematography. "Though at times squintingly dark, his New Mexico scrub and skylines are distractingly pleasing," Catsoulis wrote. "While marquee names wrestle with characters as insubstantial as holograms, Lloyd gives us a reason to keep watching."
JUDY (2019) Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This year's Golden Globe Awards ceremony is on Sunday night, and The New York Times's Carpetbagger columnist recently predicted that Renée Zellweger would win an acting award for her portrayal of the singer and actor Judy Garland in this biopic. "Judy" zooms in on its subject in the final year of her life, with Zellweger playing Garland struggling through a string of concerts at a London cabaret-restaurant in the late-1960s. She's broke, with a pill habit, family problems and a troubled past. (Zellweger has a lot to work with, carefully.) The movie is "part maternal melodrama, part martyr story," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "Mostly," she added, "'Judy' offers the familiar spectacle of one star playing another. Zellweger's performance is credible, with agitated flutters and filigreed touches, though it leans hard on Judy's tremulous fragility, as if she were a panicked hummingbird."
What's on TV
LITTLE WOMEN (1994) 7 p.m. on Showtime Showcase. Those who have gone to see Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women" in theaters and want to experience another take on the material can turn to this 1994 version, which casts Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado and Kirsten Dunst as the four March sisters, and follows them as they come of age. The cast also includes Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale. "It's actually one of the few movies of mine I don't turn off when it comes on," Ryder said in a recent interview with The Times. "I think every generation," she said, "deserves their own 'Little Women."'
ANTIQUES ROADSHOW RECUT 8:30 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). This new, half-hour version of PBS's popular antiques-appraisal show kicks off with an episode that focuses on vintage objects from United States politics, like signed photos of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, and a drum used during the 1848 presidential election.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
THE EXPONENTIAL FESTIVAL at various locations (performances run through Feb. 2). This monthlong festival lauding local artists returns to Brooklyn. Participating locations this year will include the Brick, JACK, the Doxsee Theater and Vital Joint, as well as a superstore that will play host, wittingly or otherwise, to an immersive, choose-your-own-adventure show.
theexponentialfestival.org
'MY NAME IS LUCY BARTON' at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater (previews start on Jan. 4; opens on Jan. 15). Elizabeth Strout's novel, conceived by Rona Munro as a solo show, arrives on Broadway via the Manhattan Theater Club. Ben Brantley, who saw Laura Linney perform in the one-hander last year, wrote, "This is writing -- and acting -- that grows in power without your being aware of it, and the tears it elicits feel both surprising and natural."
212-239-6200, manhattantheatreclub.com
'PARIS' at Atlantic Stage 2 (previews start on Jan. 8; opens on Jan. 21). Vermont's citizenry is more than 95 percent white. And Emmie isn't. In this new play from the writer-actress Eboni Booth, Emmie (Jules Latimer) gets a job at a big-box store where she has to navigate standing out, blending in and sometimes feeling invisible. Knud Adams directs.
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
UNDER THE RADAR FESTIVAL at various locations (performances start on Jan. 8). The Public Theater's annual celebration of boundary-pushing, mold-breaking performances is back. This year's festival includes an astronomical virtual-reality experience from Laurie Anderson and Hsin-Chien Huang, a solo performance by Daniel J. Watts, and return engagements of Amir Nizar Zuabi's "Grey Rock" and Aleshea Harris's "What to Send Up When It Goes Down."
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
[ Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead. ]
'THE WOMAN IN BLACK' at the McKittrick Hotel (previews start on Jan. 8; opens on Jan. 23). If "Sleep No More" hasn't given you nightmares yet, its new housemate might. This winter, the McKittrick Hotel's Club Car will be haunted by Robin Herford's production of Susan Hill's ghost story about a spectral woman who lures children to their deaths. Ben Porter and David Acton star.

Last Chance
'DERREN BROWN: SECRET' at the Cort Theater (closes on Jan. 4). New Yorkers' secrets will be a bit safer now that this evening by Derren Brown, the English magician and mentalist, ends its Broadway run. "Every time I visit the dapper Mr. Brown," Ben Brantley wrote, "I leave in a lighter, less-polluted mood -- brainwashed in the most positive sense of the term."
212-239-6200, derrenbrownsecret.com
'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' at the Lyceum Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Jack Thorne's often delicious adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, directed by Matthew Warchus, will be packing up its chocolate chip cookies and oranges. "While retaining the jolliness and sentimentality associated with some 170 years' worth of stage versions," Ben Brantley wrote, "Thorne and Warchus have polished the story's social conscience to a restored brightness."
212-239-6200, achristmascarolbroadway.com
'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' at Stage 42 (closes on Jan. 5). Sunrise, sunset, swiftly flows the season. The National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene's Yiddish language adaptation of Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's musical, directed by Joel Grey, ends its Off Broadway run. Jesse Green wrote of Shraga Friedman's Yiddish translation, "It couldn't sound more right as spoken by these characters -- or as sung."
212-239-6200, fiddlernyc.com
'42 FT: A MENAGERIE OF MECHANICAL MARVELS' at the New Victory Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Cirque Mechanics' new show lays down its pulleys and levers. The steampunk-like gadgets in this friendly spectacle, directed by Aloysia Gavre and Chris Lashua, aren't all that marvelous. But the performers, like the strongman Battulga Battogtokh and the slack wire walker Esther De Monteflores, are.
646-223-3010, newvictory.org
'HALFWAY BITCHES GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on Jan. 5). The inhabitants of this halfway house for homeless and abused women are moving on. Ben Brantley wrote that in this noisy, capacious drama, the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis "enfolds every one of his characters in a blanket of compassion that wisely never extends to the promise of happy endings."
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'THE LIGHTNING THIEF: THE PERCY JACKSON MUSICAL' at the Longacre Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Even a demigod can't stay on Broadway forever. Joe Tracz and Rob Rokicki's adaptation of the popular middle-school novels, directed by Stephen Brackett, steps down from Olympus. Jesse Green described it as "both overblown and underproduced, filled with sentiments it can't support and effects it can't pull off."
212-239-6200, lightningthiefmusical.com
'ONE IN TWO' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on Jan. 12). Donja R. Love's new drama about queer black men living with H.I.V. ends its run. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that because of this New Group production by Stevie Walker-Webb, the play "has entered the world in a state of quiet glory, equal parts laughter and pain."
917-935-4242, thenewgroup.org
'OUR DEAR DEAD DRUG LORD' at the McGinn/Cazale Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Alexis Scheer's Off Broadway play, directed by Whitney White and set among ghost-obsessed Miami schoolgirls, puts away its Ouija board. As Ben Brantley wrote in an admiring review, "A play that started off as a hoot -- a friendly, familiar satire on high school mores and lingo -- winds up as a primal scream."
212-787-8302, wptheater.org
'SLAVA'S SNOW SHOW' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (closes on Jan. 5). This show's beloved clowns will entertain audiences through the holidays, then take their blizzard elsewhere. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that the show left her feeling as if she had just had a massage, "though a massage doesn't, generally speaking, blast paper-confetti snow down your top that you'll have to scoop out later."
212-239-6200, slavaonbroadway.com
'THE SOUND INSIDE' at Studio 54 (closes on Jan. 12). Adam Rapp's twisty drama about a creative writing professor (Mary-Louise Parker) and her student (Will Hochman) closes its books. Jesse Green, who had also seen the play at the Williamstown Theater Festival, described David Cromer's production as "even more resonant on Broadway: a tragedy about fiction, both the kind we read and the kind we live."
212-239-6200, lct.org
'TOOTSIE' at the Marquis Theater (closes on Jan. 5). David Yazbek and Robert Horn's adaptation of the beloved comedy of cross-dressing, which won a Tony for its leading man, Santino Fontana, takes off its dress. "Musical comedy only soars when it's fully grounded," Jesse Green wrote, "and 'Tootsie,' however unbelievable, has its feet on the ground -- in a modest Size 13 heel."
tootsiemusical.com
'WAITRESS' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Sugar, butter and flour turned out to be key ingredients for a long Broadway run. The Times described this 2016 Sara Bareilles musical, directed by Diane Paulus, as an "agreeable if unexceptional musical." As it serves its last slices of pie, Katharine McPhee ("Smash") wears the frilly apron.

Electric cars charging toward heart of Germany's economy

Texto completo: ÖHRINGEN, Germany - Öhringen lies deep in automaking country, homeland of Germany's biggest industry and a source of national pride. And by most appearances, life is pretty good.
The unemployment rate in Öhringen is a mere 2.3%. Restaurants, nursing homes and kindergartens are begging for workers. The city government is using bulging tax receipts to build a new secondary school and a hospital.
But just outside Öhringen's tidy old quarter, dominated by the steeple of a 15th-century stone church, there are signs that the economic upswing that has nourished this idyll is beginning to falter.
A factory that makes air filters is closing, putting 240 people out of work. The plant, owned by Mahle, an auto parts manufacturer based in nearby Stuttgart, is a victim of forces that are reshaping the auto industry and threatening the foundation of the German economy.
Global car sales are declining at the same time that companies are pouring billions of dollars into new technologies like autonomous driving and electric cars, which are easier to assemble and require fewer workers and fewer parts.
Carmakers, including Daimler and Volkswagen's Audi division, as well as suppliers like Continental and Bosch, have announced tens of thousands of job cuts in recent weeks. German auto production will be at a 22-year low in 2019 and 2020, according to calculations by Ferdinand Dudenhöffer, a professor at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
Workers are feeling the brunt, and not just in Germany. The upheaval in auto technology was an undercurrent in the United Automobile Workers' recent strike against General Motors, with GM aiming for flexibility in staffing levels as it devotes more resources to electric vehicles.
The growing popularity of electric vehicles could force a shift in the balance of power in the global car business that would have long-term consequences for Germany.
So far, sales of electric cars make up a small share of the overall auto market, but they are growing fast. In October, battery-powered cars and hybrids accounted for almost 10% of new car registrations in Europe, according to JATO, a market research firm; figures from another firm, LMC Automotive, put the share at less than 4% in the U.S. Sales of those cars in Europe were up 40% from a year earlier in an otherwise stagnant market.
If the trend continues, it spells trouble for the hundreds of suppliers that make parts for internal combustion engines. The Mahle factory in Öhringen makes equipment that controls the flow of air in diesel and gasoline motors.
"There is a transition toward more electric vehicles that have far fewer components and are easier to manufacture," Bernhard Mattes, the president of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said in an interview in Berlin. "Therefore, we can expect less employment."
Mattes, former head of Ford's operations in Germany, quoted studies estimating that a shift to electric cars could cost 70,000 jobs in Germany by 2030. Some estimates are higher.
The effect of those cuts may be felt most acutely in communities like Öhringen, where the local economy revolves around small and midsize manufacturers, often serving the auto industry. Audi, Porsche and Daimler all have factories within a 40-mile radius.
Thilo Michler, the mayor of Öhringen, said the local economy was diverse enough to survive the closing of the Mahle plant. The city, with about 25,000 residents, is also the home of other midsize companies such as Huber Packaging, the world's largest manufacturer of 5-liter beer kegs.
Unemployment is so low that most Mahle workers will probably find new jobs by the time the plant ceases operations by the end of 2020. But they will have trouble finding work that pays as well, and they may have to accept temporary contracts that offer little job security, said Rüdiger Bresien, an official of the IG Metall union who represents workers in the area.

Texto completo: SALVADOR, Brazil " Clovis Dias de Oliveira sat behind the counter of his empty store filled with touristy knickknacks, looking at his phone, scrolling through Face book, shaking his head. More bad news.
A pair of gangs had recently battled it out. A man had been shot. Arrests had been made. This latest violence had erupted not in some faraway slum, but right here, in the heart of this historic town's famed colonial district.
Officials have been saying Salvador, with its gorgeous beaches, colonial architecture and a unique Africa-influenced culture, could help solve one of Brazil's most enduring riddles: how to attract tourists. But Oliveira, 36, wasn't so sure.
'Even I don't feel safe here,' he said, exasperated. 'I've seen tourists, lots of them, robbed here. And they come, and then they never come back.'
Latin America's largest country has come to a critical point in its long-troubled relationship with tourism. While many of the world's most attractive destinations are experiencing a boom, and other Latin American countries such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic are cashing in, Brazil brought in only 6.6-million foreign visitors in 2018 " fewer than theocratic Iran, fewer than conflict-torn Ukraine, fewer, even, than just the Louvre Museum in Paris.
But the tally was higher " ever so slightly " than the year before. Now the government is looking to build on it and fulfill the tourism potential of a country that boasts thousands of miles of coastline, the Amazon rainforest, mountain ranges and a famously warm and welcoming people. By 2022, officials have pledged, they'll double the number of foreign visitors.

Doing so would also double the number of foreign dollars coming into a country badly in need of them. Hobbled by high unemployment and economic stagnation, Brazil took in only around $6-billion from foreign tourism in 2018. The United States collected $210-billion; tiny Portugal amassed $18-billion, according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization.
Officials have eliminated visa requirements for citizens of the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, China and Qatar. They've launched a global public relations campaign called 'Brazil by Brasil' that's papering cities in the United States and Europe with advertisements that are ambiguous yet strangely enticing: 'Meet a new Brazil, modern and productive.' And Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro speaks often of tourism " venting, for example, about the environmental protections he says inhibit tourism and speaking wistfully about creating the Brazilian equivalents of Cancun and Cozumel.
'Our tourism [situation] is frustrating, in view that we are first in the world in natural beauty,' Bolsonaro said last year. 'We want to preserve the environment, but if any other country in the world had our marvels, it would be making billions from tourism. But we can't.'

But whether the Bolsonaro administration can achieve its own lofty aspirations will be, to a certain extent, a test of whether it can get out of its own way.
The number of foreign visitors dropped 5 percent last year amid a drumbeat of bad news and international condemnation. There were the Amazon forest fires. Then a devastating oil spill. A record number of killings by police in Rio de Janeiro. And through it all, a president who revels in political provocation " saying he'd rather have a dead son than a gay one, calling for criminals to be killed in the streets 'like cockroaches,' insulting the appearance of the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron.
'Bolsonaro isn't particularly appealing,' said Thomas Kohnstamm, who wrote a Lonely Planet guide to Brazil, and then a tell-all memoir about the experience. 'Brazil attracts more independent travelers, who are a more progressive group. So when the Bolsonaro campaign hand sign is a gun and he's saying, 'I'd rather have a dead son than a gay son,' that doesn't play really well.'

For Brazil, it's no one thing that's keeping the visitors away. Turkey, for instance, also has a leader with authoritarian tendencies in President Recep Tayyip Erdogan " but the number of tourists flocking to that country has swelled from 31-million to 46-million in the past decade. Mexico, another country debilitated by violence, welcomed 41-million visitors in 2018 " nearly twice the volume of 2010.
Brazil, wedged between the Andes and the Atlantic, thousands of miles from the United States, farther from Europe and Asia, remains remote " and not only geographically. The people speak Portuguese. The culture, with its many influences, is unique. Plus, flights are expensive.
'The goal is impossible,' concluded Luiz Gustavo Barbosa, who studies tourism at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a university in Rio de Janeiro. 'It's impossible because the goal was wrong from the beginning.'
The challenge feels particularly acute in the seaside city of Salvador. Founded by the Portuguese as Brazil's first capital, it is today a laboratory for the country's experimentation with tourism.
Authorities recently completed a five-year renovation of the historic district, Pelourinho, one of the largest stretches of colonial architecture in the Americas. The New York Times last year named the city one of its 52 places to explore. And according to the local airport, the number of foreign entries increased 25 percent in the first six months of 2019.
'Salvador is ready for tourists,' declared Claudio Tinoco Melo de Oliveira, the city's tourism director. 'We're talking about Brazil's first capital. Our potential is much greater.'
But parts of Salvador, one of the most violent cities in a violent country, have the hunted feeling of a town besieged. Police officers stand on every street corner, springing into action to arrest pickpockets, one of whom attempted to rob this reporter at dusk one night.

Shopkeepers complain about the constant threat of crime. 'There are robberies and assaults, and then tourists stop coming!' said Tabmo Oliveira Junior, as he served gelato at an ice cream shop.
Tourists are skittish.
'Of course we're concerned,' said Amavry Menanteu, a visitor from France who was waiting just outside his hotel for an Uber to avoid a risky walk. 'We have to check wherever we can travel and walk, and when we arrived here, we had to ask where we could go.'
'If I was here alone, I would not feel safe,' said a 28-year-old woman from Germany who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions. 'We are clearly a target; we are the whitest people here and we obviously stick out' as tourists.
But it's getting better, promised Gustavo Ribero. It has to " for Salvador's sake, and for his own. He recently took over the posh restaurant Maria Mata Mouro " which, despite the excellent food, had just clocked another slow night.
'I believe in this place,' he said. 'It has the most potential of anywhere in the country . . . and I believe in a better future here. I've invested my life here.'

Texto completo: Former HBO Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Plepler signed an exclusive production deal with Apple Inc.'s new TV streaming service, a five-year deal that underscores the tech giant's growing ambitions in entertainment.
The deal will include original series, feature films and documentaries for Apple TV+, its new streaming service, according to the company. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported in November that Apple and Mr. Plepler were in advanced discussions , and the New York Times first reported that they had reached a deal.
Mr. Plepler will be working with Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht, the company's heads of world-wide video. Mr. Plepler launched Eden Productions, a new production company based in New York.
Apple's signing of Mr. Plepler gives its streaming service, which launched Nov. 1 with nine new programs, an experienced and well-known entertainment veteran, as it aims to compete with Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s dominant streaming platforms.

"I'm excited to work with Zack, Jamie and the standout team at Apple who have been deeply supportive of my vision for Eden from day one," Mr. Plepler said in a statement Thursday. "Apple is one of the most creative companies in the world, and the perfect home for my new production company and next chapter."
Mr. Plepler had been with HBO for nearly 30 years, the last six as its CEO. He left the company last February after it became clear that he would have less control under AT&T Inc., its new owner, than under prior owner Time Warner Inc.
Apple is in a race to beef up the offerings of its fledgling TV service, which is available for a price of $4.99 a month or free with some purchases of new company merchandise. Apple has struck agreements for shows with producers Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams and mogul Oprah Winfrey. Apple has also held talks with James Bond-franchise owner MGM Holdings Inc. and the Pac-12 Conference, according to people familiar with the matter.
Apple has joined a heated competition with Netflix, Walt Disney Co. and other companies seeking to build streaming content, as viewers opt out of big cable television packages.
The company is also seeking to steer consumers toward subscription options for video, music and other services. Its goal is to surpass 500 million paid subscriptions next year. Apple currently has 450 million paid subscriptions, a 36% increase from the 330 million it reported in 2018.

Emails Show Pentagon Official's Concerns Over Ukraine Aid Freeze; Elaine McCusker, acting Pentagon comptroller, raised concerns about the legality of the hold on nearly $400 million in aid

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A senior Pentagon official clashed with the White House over its decision to freeze security aid to Ukraine, repeatedly warning that the hold could complicate the administration's ability to distribute the money before a congressionally mandated deadline, according to unredacted emails obtained by an outside group.
Beginning in July, Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, sent officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget emails in which she raised concerns about the legality of the hold on nearly $400 million in aid. Though Pentagon officials' frustrations were previously known, the emails, earlier versions of which had been redacted by the Justice Department, offer a new level of detail about Ms. McCusker's concerns.
Ms. McCusker's most dire predictions didn't come true—at one point she warned that $120 million or more of the aid was at risk of not being spent. But after the White House lifted its hold on Sept. 11, more than $35 million in aid didn't make it to Ukraine by the time the fiscal year ended at the end of that month.
The decision to freeze the aid to Ukraine was at the center of the House's investigation of President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment last month . The Senate is now expected to hold a trial, and Democrats are pushing for testimony from administration officials in an effort to determine whether the decision to pause the aid was directly connected to Mr. Trump's desire for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations that could benefit the president in the 2020 U.S. election. Mr. Trump has said he didn't make the aid contingent on the investigations.

A heavily redacted version of some documents related to the aid was obtained and released last month by the Center for Public Integrity through a public information request. Just Security, a group that publishes national security research and journalism, reviewed and published portions of the unredacted emails on Thursday. An administration official confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that the emails are authentic.
The Defense Department didn't respond to requests for comment. Ms. McCusker couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the emails "a devastating blow to Senator McConnell's push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we've requested."
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) referred to comments the lawmaker made on the Senate floor last month. He said at the time that he wanted to put off any contentious resolutions—such as those calling witnesses—until a later phase of the trial.
The new emails reflect deep tension between Ms. McCusker and OMB. The relationship between Ms. McCusker and OMB slowly deteriorated, as senior officials at the office grew skeptical of her estimates of how much money was at risk of not being spent, according to people familiar with their interactions.
In response to the emails, OMB countered that Ms. McCusker's frustrations didn't reflect what they were hearing from other Pentagon officials.
"There was agreement every step of the way between DOD and OMB lawyers, who were responsible for working out the details of the hold, in line with the President's priorities," OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said in a statement.
In her emails to OMB, Ms. McCusker raised concerns that the White House was violating the Impoundment Control Act, which requires that the executive branch spend money that has been appropriated by Congress.
After the administration imposed its hold on the aid in July and later extended it, Ms. McCusker objected to language included in a budget document by OMB that said the pause wouldn't prevent the Defense Department from spending the money.
"We hope it won't and will do all we can to execute once the policy decision is made, but can no longer make that declarative statement," she wrote in an Aug. 6 email to OMB officials.
Ms. McCusker also disagreed with talking points distributed by OMB after Politico first reported in late August that the aid had been put on hold. "No action has been taken by OMB that would preclude the obligation of these funds before the end of the fiscal year," the talking points said. The talking points asserted that the hold didn't preclude the money from being spent before the end of the fiscal year
In response, Ms. McCusker wrote that the talking point about the aid was "not accurate from a financial execution standpoint, something we have been consistently conveying for a few weeks." A senior administration official said lawyers in the Pentagon's Office of the General Counsel reviewed, edited and signed off on the talking points, an assertion supported by a document reviewed by the Journal.
Ms. McCusker's frustrations escalated in early September. After she warned OMB that $120 million might not be able to be spent by the end of the fiscal year because of the hold, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at OMB, responded with a letter that put the blame on the Defense Department for not doing enough to prepare to spend the funds if they were released.
Ms. McCusker replied, in an exchange first reported by the New York Times, "You can't be serious. I am speechless."

Texto completo: Like many of my heroes and sheroes, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, John Coltrane and Diana Sands, they were taken from us or departed as their fruitful potential was just beginning to ripen and mature. They were only 39 or 40 when they were killed or died from an illness, and they are summoned at this moment as we reflect on the very brief life of photographer and playwright Christine Chambers.
Chambers, who died on Dec. 4 at NewYorkPresbyterian Hospital from complications of a lung infection, according to her sister Essie Jane Chambers, may not have achieved the fame and recognition of these notables, but she accomplished quite a bit as she worked tirelessly in the world of Black theater, documenting it in her photographs and invigorating it with her plays.
Bom Christine Jean Chambers on Sept. 8, 1980 in Northampton, Mass., her father John Walker Chambers taught sociology at the University of Massachusetts and at Greenfield Community College. Later he became a social worker. I Ier mother, Molly (Pratt) Chambers, was a therapist and social worker.
At a very early age, Chambers began to evince those interests that would consume her later years, beginning at Wilbraham and Monson Academy, a boarding school in Massachusetts where she was a member of the Academy Repertory Company and the Academy Players, appearing in productions as varied as "Cabaret" and "The Trojan Women." In 1999, she graduated. She later attended the University of Virginia where she earned a bachelor's degree in English in 2004. Later at Columbia University, she studied for her master's degree of fine arts in playwriting.
The last ten years or so, she devoted herself to writing plays with an aim toward probing what it meant to be biracial, as she was. Her mother was white, and her father v.as Black.
Among her plays that were stagec in small New York Theaters was "I lalf Brothers," a play aboui a man who becomes the executor of his father's estate and subsequently meets his two half-brothers for the first time. In "Tire Eternal Return" a 3:ack couple explores what happened in their failed relationship. Another play "One Quarter," a woman of mixed ethnicities delves into what her life would have been with a daughter she lost during a miscarriage, and that daughter would have been much like Chambers herseT, though with a half-Black mother and a white father.
"What if no one sees her?" the protagonist asks in the play, concerned that her daughter's blackness would be diminished. "What if she looks like me and can't see herself?" And finally, "What if my daughter comes into this world and I still feel alone in it?"
These were a few of the questions she instilled in her characters and to some extent they must have resonated directly from her own place in the world as a product of different races.
In the obituary in The New York Times, playwright Kelley Girod, a close friend said, "She made us proud of who we were and where we came from and that's what we were trying to express onstage. She helped us see ourselves in the act of claiming ourselves." Girod, is founder and executive producer of the Fire This Time Festival, which features the work of playwrights of color. Chambers was commissioned to photograph theatrical productions at the festival and at other theatrical festivals and venues. "So much of her identity was about living in this in-between world, where she wasn't Black and wasn't white," Girod added. "That space in between was important to her; it's the space that defined who she was." "She helped crystallize our brand," said Jonathan McCrory, the theater's artistic director, "She gave visual amplification to innovative Black storytelling."
Her photographs also evoke stories and framed moments, moments all the more remarkable given the lupus, which she had througnout her life, stiffened her joints and hands. Even holding her camera was challenging. Her illness was widely shared on social media and she amassed a number of partners online. "Just because we (ppi w/ aute immune) have invisible illnesses does not mean we need to make ourselves invisible."
That visibility was becoming all the more evident in her final days, her plays and camera assuring her a lasting memory.

Texto completo: Headnote BOOKS
FOR SOMEONE WHO called himself the third-best writer in his own family, Stan Hochman left a significant mark in Philadelphia.
The longtime Philadelphia Daily News sports columnist died in 2015 at 86, but his wife, Gloria - an author in her own right - is making sure he's not forgotten.
"He left a legacy that was deserving of being spread to more people," she said.
Gloria Hochman read through more than 7,000 of her husband's columns and has pulled together 100 of the best for a new book entitled "Stan Hochman Unfiltered: 50 Years of Wit and Wisdom from the Groundbreaking Sportswriter" to be released Jan. 10 by Temple University Press.
"I laughed and I cried and I giggled and I sighed and I was dazzled over and over by his ability to put words to paper," she said.
The book is organized by sport, with each section introduced by a luminary in the field. For example, former Phillies Gold Glove outfielder Garry Maddox introduces the baseball columns, while Flyers Hall of Fame goalie Bernie Parent does likewise with hockey.
Gloria Hochman said culling the columns was difficult, but some stood out. She noted that her husband was less interested in statistics and more interested in the hearts and souls of the athletes he covered.
"He wrote as though he was painting a picture," she said, citing columns about basketball star Magic Johnson's positive HIV test and Muhammad All's late-career loss to Larry Holmes.
"When you are Magic, HIV positive is something that happens to other guys .... When you're truly, truly magical, some insidious virus does not invade your bloodstream," Stan Hochman wrote.
About Ali, Hochman wrote: "It was as graceless as a firing squad execution. Muhammad Ali does not smoke, so they could not offer him a final cigarette. He needed a blindfold when it was over to cover his lumpy, blackened eyes," he wrote about Ali,
Stan Hochman, who among numerous honors was inducted into the Philadelphia Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, didn't typically write about his Jewish heritage, but he didn't shy away from it either.

"You could tell it was a part of him," Gloria Hochman said.
In a 2011 column, he wrote about a trip to Puerto Vallaría where he had lunch with Elizabeth Taylor.
"I was close enough to reach out and touch her if I dared. I didn't dare," he wrote. "Those Violet eyes were flashing hostility. Why not? She had been through tough times with Eddie Fisher, and he was Jewish and from Philadelphia, and I was Jewish, from Philadelphia, and a writer, and if that wasn't a toxic trifecta, it sure seemed that way gazing into those violet eyes."
The book's also a chance to let Stan Hochman's wry sense of humor shine through, his wife said, pointing to a 1990 column about the small part he played in "Rocky V" as a rude sportswriter.
"I just wish (Sylvester Stallone) didn't have this skewed vision of what Philadelphia sportswriters are all about, depicting them as rude, crude, corruptible. And dull. How do I know? Because I'm in 'Rocky V,' playing one of those rude, crude, unimaginative writers."
A native of Brooklyn, New York, Stan Hochman wound up in Philadelphia in 1959, hired by the Daily News to cover the Phillies, and spent the next 55 years working for the paper. Gloria Hochman noted that his career was so long that he sent his first piece into the Daily News newsroom via Morse code.

Gloria Hochman said she met her husband-to-be at an event he was covering at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel, where she handled public relations. She was annoyed that his subsequent article didn't mention the hotel.
When she brought that up the next time they met - at an Army-Navy Game event - she got a lecture in journalistic ethics, not to mention a date.
Gloria Hochman, who wrote an introduction to the book, is an accomplished author in her own right - one of the several writers in the family, along with daughter Anndee Hochman, who writes The Parent Trip column for The Philadelphia Inquirer.
She's written largely about health issues, and a book she co-authored with the late actress Patty Duke entitled, "Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic Depressive Illness," made The New York Times Best Sellers List.
Her husband used to joke about the difference in their beats.
"He said, T write about fun and games. You write about life and death,"' she said. *

Trump's cellphone use puts nation at risk It's worse than Hillary Clinton use of a private email server for official business.

Texto completo: The Washington Post
The Kremlin might know more about conversations between President Trump, Rudy Giuliani and others involved in the Ukraine gambit that led to Congress' impeachment inquiry than congressional investigators themselves. The reason for this alarming reality? A dangerous fondness for cellphones.
Trump's insistence on using his personal cellphone for official communications was a problem the moment he stepped into the Oval Office - after a campaign spent railing against rival Hillary Clinton for sending state emails on a private server. Now, call records obtained by the House have resurrected concerns about how the president and his closest associates communicate about the most sensitive of matters, and who exactly might be listening.
Trump claims he relies exclusively on government-issued devices hardened against hacks. But last year, The New York Times reported he favored a mass-market iPhone for dialing his friends, and Chinese spies often eavesdropped for insights on how they might sway the administration. Even if all the commander in chief's phones are now specifically programmed for protection, there's still a risk if they're not routinely scrubbed or swapped out - measures Trump in the past allegedly declared "too inconvenient."
Security experts also say cellphones are generally more vulnerable than landlines. Adversaries eager to intercept privileged chats, for example, can "spoof" the towers through which calls are routed. John Kelly's success in getting Trump to move to White House channels was short-lived; the president discovered that meant the then-chief of staff could access a log of his calls, and he reverted to his old habits.
Even if Trump conducted conversations only from sanctified facilities such as the Situation Room, they would still be only as safe from surveillance as their recipient - which, as witness testimony these past few weeks has revealed, is not safe at all. Giuliani's communications, it seems, were not encrypted with any of the widely available services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Similarly, U.S. ambassadors speaking to the president are supposed to do so from an embassy on a secure line, not from a restaurant in Kiev on an unsecured cellphone.
The White House, in short, seems content to privilege convenience over secrecy. Barack Obama famously fought to keep his iPhone when he became president. He won, but the device he ended up with was so restricted for security's sake that using it, he said, was "no fun."
At least he understood that it wasn't supposed to be.

Don't forget history on program aimed at curbing drug prices It prevented the U.S. from negotiating with drugmakers and from importing cheaper drugs.

Texto completo: This is a story about how far politicians will go to get a president re-elected. No digging up dirt in a foreign country required, just old-fashioned arm twisting, a few ethical lapses and a talent for drama in the nighttime.
It's also about how politicians might not have needed to cry crocodile tears over high prescription drug prices now if they hadn't been so recklessly partisan 16 years ago.
Forbes magazine called it "one of the most extraordinary events in congressional history." The New York Times called it "the largest expansion of the welfare state since the creation of Medicare in 1965."
All because President George W. Bush needed more senior votes to be re-elected in 2004.
The Republicans had a dandy idea: Give Medicare recipients prescription drug coverage for the first time.
The idea had been in the works for months, but the end was tawdry. This is how it went:
Speaker Dennis Hastert brought up the bill in the wee hours of the night, first turning off C-SPAN's cameras. (It passed the Senate, 55-45, with votes from Maine's Republican Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe.) Even though the Republicans controlled Congress, they didn't have the House votes for the bill.
Medicare was already in financial trouble. Fiscal hawks weren't sure this was a good idea.
After the usual 15-minute vote, it was losing 209 to 194, so Hastert kept the board open for hours so his team could twist arms; he impressed upon them the urgency of getting the bill passed. "We must forget about ideological absolutes," he said.
The Republicans twisted arms for hours, and when the final vote came at 5:52 a.m., the bill passed 216-215. (Maine's Democratic Reps. Tom Allen and Mike Michaud voted against it.)
It was one of the most expensive bills ever to come before Congress, but it had no funding source whatsoever.
The entire cost went straight to the deficit.
"We didn't have the votes to pay for it," Sen. Orrin Hatch said later.
The Republicans even kept the cost secret to get the bill passed. Medicare's chief actuary, Richard S. Foster, knew the bill would cost $534 billion over 10 years though congressional budget resolutions had capped the cost at $400 billion.
Foster's boss, Thomas A. Scully, told Foster he would fire him if he told Congress the truth.
The inspector general later threatened Scully with an ethics violation but he quit before the ink had dried on the bill. Majority Leader Tom DeLay was reprimanded for his arm-twisting.
Turns out this was a bill for the drug industry, not for seniors. More than 900 people signed up to lobby for it.
"The pharmaceutical lobbyists wrote the bill," Rep. Walter Jones, a North Carolina Republican, told "60 Minutes."
Here's the relevance for today's drug price debate, as politicians scurry to get into the act: The bill prevented the government from negotiating with drug companies and from importing cheaper drugs. Would drug prices be lower now if those provisions hadn't been included back then?
Seniors weren't impressed. Days after Bush signed the bill, a poll showed 47 percent opposing and 26 percent approving the changes. Some members of Congress of both parties said seniors might actually be worse off with the bill.
Mark Serafini wrote in the National Journal: "(T)he group that should have come out on top - America's seniors - was reeling at the prospect of limited help, while watching industry groups count their bounty."
Louisiana Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, the bill's chief House architect, became a lobbyist for the drug industry afterward.
For five years, as president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, he successfully fought Congressional efforts to lower drug prices.
Bush was re-elected.

Don't force your sons to see 'Little Women' A story written to appeal to women and girls need not be required for boys.

Texto completo: On Christmas day, Greta Gerwig's updated version of the young adult classic "Little Women" opened in theaters to great acclaim, fantastic reviews and strong box office numbers.
And yet, some women found fault with the fact that not enough men were flocking to see it.
In a piece for The New York Times, writer Kristy Eldredge observed that the film hadn't garnered a lot of award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild (zero) and the Golden Globes (two), and mentioned that the audiences seemed to be overwhelmingly filled with women. Film producer Amy Pascal agrees, arguing in Vanity Fair that many male awards-season voters are skipping Gerwig's adaptation because they think it's not for guys.
Eldredge seemed to blame men for not appreciating female-centric stories and framed it as some sort of character flaw that society needed to address: "If many men haven't wanted to give it a chance because they don't think it's meant for them, we still have a way to go in considering all kinds of narratives about women to be deserving of thoughtful attention."
It's not surprising that a story about the relationship between four Civil War-era sisters written over 150 years ago and with absolutely no battlefield scenes is not a favorite with the Xbox set.
While there has always been some cross-gender interest in young adult literature like "A Separate Peace" and "Catcher in the Rye," which have strong male characters, there is a universality of message in those books. In other words, Holden Caulfield's existential angst and the rough contours of Gene and Phinny's tragic friendship have resonance beyond their masculinity. You could imagine a female Holden, or an equally traumatic betrayal between two young women at an all-girls school.
But "Little Women" is really just a movie about females, and their dreams and aspirations and disappointments, and that's perfectly OK. In fact, it's sublime. The book and the movies adapted from it are some of the most touching examples of female bonding in literary and cinematic history. As a Bryn Mawr graduate - like Katharine Hepburn - I am partial to the 1933 film, but Gerwig's adaptation is exceptional and deserving of all the accolades it will earn, despite the naysayers.
But it is a bit ridiculous for women to be complaining that men are not interested in a book and movie called, for lord's sake, "Little WOMEN." This preoccupation with "gender parity" has become cult-like.
I know a bunch of boys around the age of 11 or 12 who love dinosaurs and Jedis. They also love Harry Potter, "The Lord of the Rings," R.L. Stine, and any number of things that girls the same age might also enjoy. These are clearly things that bridge a gender divide because they are not specifically "male" or "female."
But when I was growing up, there were toys you gave to boys and toys you gave to girls, and it was not considered a hate crime to insist that your daughter not be given a GI Joe doll or that your son put down the Barbie. It was OK to recognize that there were stereotypes for a reason, namely, that boys and girls had different interests.
I don't share the angst over a presumed lack of interest on the part of men about the destinies of Meg, Jo, Amy and Beth March.
Ironically, Louisa May Alcott herself wasn't thrilled with the idea of writing what she called a "girls' story."
She wrote in her diary: "I plod away, though I don't enjoy this sort of thing. Never liked girls or knew many, except my sisters; but our queer plays and experiences may prove interesting, though I doubt it."
If even the writer of this wonderful girls' story doesn't expect boys to like it, why in the world should we?

Texto completo: Newspaper's survival leads to informed community
I have often seen Post-Dispatch readers complain that they are dropping their subscriptions after reading an editorial that they disagree with. But there is so much more to the newspaper paper than the two pages of commentary. And we all know that very little of it, if any, is "fake."
You can look back on 2019 and see numerous instances of stories that provided reliable information based on sound research and interviews, and not "alternative facts." I just finished a New York Times article about what happens when a local newspaper stops publishing due to financial issues. Most of the readers complain now about the lack of information on actions being taken by state and local officials, news events, leading to a feeling of isolation, etc. This information is rarely provided through television news, where one- or two-minute stories are typical.
We should encourage greater newspaper readership to support this institution and the organization responsible for producing it. The benefit of such an effort will be a more informed population. It can help all of us experience a greater sense of community, and it's also a great way to start the day.

A true Christian would ask for forgiveness of sins
Regarding "Trump blasts Christian magazine that called for his removal" (Dec. 21): Rev. Franklin Graham says, "Is President Trump guilty of sin? Of course he is, as each one of us are, including myself." But has President Donald Trump ever said he was sorry and asked for forgiveness?

Trump is really a 'bully', not a 'counterpuncher'
Regarding "White House claims Trump 'just riffing' with insult of dead Democrat, wife" (Dec. 19): When President Donald Trump lashes out at those who are critical of him, his defenders say that he is a counterpuncher. Considering that these people are in positions of much less power than his, including a disabled reporter, a Gold Star family, a deceased U.S. senator, a deceased U.S. representative and his widow, and a teen girl, isn't the word "bully" a much better descriptor for such a person?

Women are leading way for Missouri's 'blue uprising'
There's a blue uprising happening in Missouri. Democrats, Independents and even some Republicans who value national security, human rights and the rule of law are organizing in numbers not seen in years. They are determined to stop the attacks on our society and democracy, and are driven by two major concerns shared by millions of Americans.
The first concern is the danger the GOP poses to national security, since it has gone "all-in" with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and other anti-democratic criminal dictators. The GOP love fest is for our enemies who financially or politically benefit President Donald Trump. The GOP is greatly endangering our security. Patriotic Americans are determined to stop these insider attacks.
The second concern is the broad attacks on voting, women's and other rights and the blatant GOP lies at the state and national levels. These lies and attacks have galvanized those who value truth and human rights. The people are building a network of candidates to take Missouri and the country out of the hands of those who are deliberately destroying democracy.
And women are leading the charge. There are extremely impressive women on the ballot. Their experience and abilities make them outstanding candidates for state and federal office. They are seeking to eliminate the rampant corruption and secrecy at the state and federal levels. They are leading the way toward transparent and honest governments which will work for the people rather than ignoring or working against the people.

Diverse nurse workforce needed for underserved
Regarding "Mercy ends plan for midwifery services in Ferguson after dispute with Jamaa Birth Village" (Dec. 21): I am a clinical nurse specialist with a board certification in public health and deeply concerned about the disparities in health care in the St. Louis region. In order to provide patient-centered care to reduce health care disparities, fostering culturally congruent care and increasing diversity in the nursing workforce is essential.
Lack of diversity in the nursing workforce remains a problem in the St. Louis metropolitan area. According to the Missouri Center for Nursing, 83% of nurses in Missouri are white and 90% are women. Providing opportunities for persons from underrepresented ethnic and racial backgrounds, who may also be disadvantaged economically, may be a primary way to close the gap in diversity in the nursing workforce, ultimately impacting health care disparities in the region.
Providing access, funding, and opportunities for many of the people living in socioeconomically depressed areas to become future nurses may assist in this plight. Furthermore, encouraging nurses from diverse backgrounds to further their education and become nursing faculty may also help increase the numbers of diversity in the workforce.
Mercy Hospital usurping the ideas and excellent community-driven, culturally congruent services that the Jamaa Birth Village provides is not the answer. It is time to support, encourage and provide culturally competent care through access to nursing education to those from underserved ethnic, racial and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Always make 'Ed E Kit' your pickleball partner
Regarding the letter, "Uncivil behavior has now invaded pickleball court" (Dec. 15): As a volunteer pickleball instructor and retiree, I'm sorry to read that politics and rude behavior have invaded a recreational activity which I enjoy. The team of volunteers I work with suggest that we always choose a partner named, "Ed E Kitt." He is not rude; he is encouraging; he congratulates his opponents on good shots; he doesn't say he is sorry more than 10 times a game; and he is happy to talk with others while waiting to play. Pickleball has become a popular activity. I'm hoping those who play it have fun, make friends, and get some exercise.

Texto completo: Compiled from JTA and JNS reports
A 32-year-old man pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and burglary charges for a stabbing attack at the at the home of a Hasidic rabbi in Monsey, New York, on Dec. 28.
Grafton Thomas, 37, of Greenwood Lake, New York, is facing five counts of attempted murder and one count of burglary. He was arrested early on Dec. 29, and was arraigned later that day. CNN is reporting he is scheduled to again appear in court on Friday, Jan. 3.
Public defender Kristine Ciganek said in court that her client had no criminal history and lived with his mother. Bail was set at $ 5 million.
A statement issued Dec. 29 by a lawyer, Michael Sussman, in the name of the family said Thomas “had a long history of mental illness and hospitalizations” and “no known history of anti-Semitism,” The New York Times reported.
Police say a black male carrying a long machete allegedly entered a home and prayer hall known as Rabbi Rottenberg’s Shul in Monsey, the night of Dec. 28, slashing and injuring five of the dozens of celebrants at a Chanukah candle-lighting party.
According to eyewitnesses, the man’s face was covered by a scarf as with a machete he slashed and stabbed with a machete at ultra-Orthodox attendees at the intimate gathering, who threw chairs and tables at him and whisked children away to safety.
After the attacker fled the home, he attempted to break into a neighboring synagogue, but found the doors locked after worshippers barred themselves inside.
Four of the five victims have reportedly already been identified, and at least two are reported to be in critical condition. Three of the victims are reportedly members of the family of the rabbi in whose home the attack occurred: Chaim, Meir and Shlomo Rottenberg, and the fourth is Rabbi Yosef Neiman.
Three had been released from the hospital. The others, Nachman Ingorsky and Neiman, reportedly were in critical condition. Neiman, a retired fishmonger in his 70s, had undergone three surgeries since the attack, according to Tzvi Rottenberg, the rabbi’s nephew.
Rottenberg said both men are dedicated followers of the rabbi. Neiman in particular, he said, is known for his pleasant disposition. Since retiring, he has spent much of his time studying Torah in and around the synagogue.
“He’s one of the most important people in the community,” Rottenberg said. “He’s here always. He’s a very happy, social person. He always has something nice to say.”
Joseph Gluck, the administrator of the Orthodox synagogue next door, helped evacuate party guests from the house. Then he came back and threw a coffee table at the attacker’s head. As the attacker fled, Gluck took down his license plate number.
President Donald Trump called the attack at a rabbi’s home in Monsey, New York, “horrific.”
“The anti-Semitic attack in Monsey, New York, on the 7th night of Hanukkah last night is horrific,” Trump said Sunday afternoon in a tweet. “We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism. Melania and I wish the victims a quick and full recovery.”
At least five additional anti-Semitic attacks have been reported across New York City and Brooklyn since the beginning of Chanukah, including a brutal assault on a 65-year-old man, an attack on two Jewish children, harassment against a Jewish man by a gang, a violent assault against a man by a gang and an attack on a Jewish male by a lone attacker.

OUR PRIVATE DATA ISN’T ACTUALLY PRIVATE

Texto completo: Millions of smartphone users globally got an unpleasant surprise this holiday season. ToTok, one of those “free, fast and secure” messaging apps they used to chat with family and friends, was a spying tool designed by the government of the United Arab Emirates. Americans ought to be alarmed by the news, but they also ought to be alarmed by something else: Our private data isn’t actually private, either.
The New York Times obtained a cache of location information from 12 million phones that combine together for 50 billion geographic pings. Each phone user is captured by thousands of dots on a map that, when connected, reveal the most intimate details of his or her day-to-day life. Seemingly innocent apps, from jewel-swapping games to weather services, soak up our movements and sell them to brokers who in turn sell them to advertisers. The entire enterprise is completely legal.
That a massive market for location data exists isn’t a revelation, but viewing so vast a collection of information in so concentrated a place still is revelatory. The Times was able to track Inauguration Day protesters, follow scientists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, trace a Post journalist through Arlington, Virginia and even travel in President Donald Trump’s digital footprints as he lounged at Mar-a-Lago and golfed at his club in Jupiter, Florida.
The data was safe in the Times’s hands, but what about the hands of an enemy state seeking to blackmail an intelligence operative, or an abusive husband trying to find his fleeing wife? And what about the idea of ambient privacy - our ability to move through the world without the knowledge that someone, somewhere, is always watching?
Many have used the Times report to call for the regulation of location data, which, as the paper’s analysis makes manifest, can never be truly anonymized. They’re right to ask for that, but they should ask for more along with it: a comprehensive privacy framework that looks beyond a single category to restrict how companies collect, keep, process and share our personal information. That framework should put an emphasis on what data companies reasonably need to gather (much less sell) to provide a service, rather than what data they’d like to collect to fill their coffers.
The Times’s project and those that have come before it reveal that it doesn’t take a plot by a repressive regime to get people to surrender to surveillance. It takes only pages on pages of opaque terms of service and a legal landscape free of restraints. Perhaps if members of Congress could see their own thousands of dots moving across a map, they would finish the work they started more than a year ago and produce the robust law the country deserves.

‘It’s creepy’: Mysterious drones swarming at night over Colorado and Nebraska

Texto completo: Law enforcement in Colorado and Nebraska have received numerous reports about mysterious drones flying by night over rural parts of the states in recent weeks.
It’s unclear who the drones belong to or what they are doing, and they’ve unnerved residents, the New York Times reported.
The sightings started around mid-December and most have been between sunset and 10 p.m. The drones have blinking lights and wingspans of up to 6 feet.

“It’s creepy,” said Missy Blackman, who saw three drones hovering above her Nebraska farm. “I have a lot of questions of why and what are they, and nobody seems to have any answers.”
“It’s the fear of the unknown,” Colorado resident Dawn George added.
Michael Yowell, a sheriff’s captain in Lincoln County, Colorado, suggested it could be a mapping operation or a land survey.
“But you can’t rule out what you don’t know,” he said.
The Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation into the mystery, according to spokesman Ian Gregor.
“Multiple F.A.A. divisions and government agencies are investigating these reports,” he said in an email.
Sheriff James Brueggeman of Perkins County, Nebraska, said some residents have wanted to shoot down the unmanned aircraft, but he has urged them to report the sightings to law enforcement instead.
“I think it’s kind of a joke, but you have to remember the part of the country we live in,” the sheriff said. “People here don’t like their privacy to be invaded.”
Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner said he was “closely” monitoring the situation.

Last week, the FAA proposed new regulations that would require most drones to be unidentifiable. Gregor said the timing of the sightings and the proposed regulations was unrelated.

The Iowa caucus results will be totally white this year: Democrats need to ask why

Texto completo: About 100% of Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats who caucus or vote in the primaries will choose a white candidate next month. That’s quite an outcome for the much vaunted “most racially diverse field ever.”
Why? Sometimes, the media likes to blame the whiteness of the early states. The New York Times explained that “some of the problem is structural: Iowa and New Hampshire — two of the whitest states in the country — play an outsize role … ” in the whole process.
Julian Castro, a Hispanic candidate who just dropped out on Thursday morning, has suggested that Iowa’s whiteness has harmed candidates of color. But this explanation runs into one very uncomfortable fact: A clear majority of Iowa Republicans in 2016 caucused for candidates of color. Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Ben Carson pulled in a combined 112,000 votes out of the 187,000 caucus votes cast. That’s 60% of all votes going to black or Hispanic candidates.
Compare that to the Democrats’ famously diverse field this year, which didn't even make it to Iowa.
Kamala Harris and Julian Castro have dropped out. Cory Booker is polling around 3% in Iowa. Since Iowa Democrats have a viability threshold, where a candidate needs at least 15% in a precinct to get any delegates, there’s a decent chance Booker will post a 0% in the Hawkeye State, and he’s polling around 1% or 2% in New Hampshire.
Andrew Yang’s numbers aren’t much better.
Thanks to the Republican 2016 results, and the fact that Obama won Iowa back in 2008, nobody can say with a straight face that the whiteness of Iowa sinks nonwhite candidates. Looking down the road to South Carolina, where a majority of the Democratic electorate was black last time, the very white Joe Biden of Delaware has been dominant. In fact, Kamala Harris never led Biden in a South Carolina poll, judging by FiveThirtyEight’s numbers.
Democrats and the left-leaning media love to count heads and make racial quotas. How many minorities are in each party in Congress? How many speakers of color have graced a podium at a conference? And so on.
Iowa this year will provide quite the contrast: While three candidates of color got 60% of the GOP caucus last time, the remaining two candidates of color will get about 0% of the Democratic caucus this time.
Democrats, who think these head counts really matter, need to keep searching for an answer.

Russia might use social media to influence the 2020 election. That's not a big deal

Texto completo: The most irritating, overblown story of the last three years has been the one about how everyone should be terrified at the idea of Russia or some other country once again trying to influence our elections by posting misinformation, or even true information, on Facebook and Twitter.
Liberals and some naive conservatives are mad at social media networks for not having an answer to the problem. But that’s because there is literally nothing anyone can do about it.
Liberal columnist Farhad Manjoo, who writes about technology for the New York Times, seems to have recognized and accepted that fact. Manjoo on Thursday offered readers “tips for improving the digital world” in the run-up to the 2020 election. None of them involve new laws or rules because, presumably, he knows that they either wouldn’t be constitutional or they simply wouldn’t work.
Manjoo’s “tips” can more or less be summed up as: Don’t be a sucker on the internet.
Wow, why hadn’t anyone thought of that before?
The 2016 election wasn’t swayed one way or the other by Russia-backed memes that simply repeated the same garbage that ordinary U.S. citizens had already been posting: Black Lives Matter, Hillary Clinton is the devil, and “like if you believe” in Jesus.
The same goes for the “fake news” that featured a bunch of made-up, alarmist stories meant to deceive voters. That kind of thing has always existed. Long ago, it reached people in the form of chain letters. Then came chain emails. Then came message boards. Now it’s on Facebook and Twitter. There was never a panic about any of it until liberals needed something to blame for President Trump’s 2016 victory.
There is and always will be dumb stuff on the internet. It didn’t matter before 2016, and it won’t matter in 2020.

Texto completo: The New York Times deleted a tweet about Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, which characterized him as "retired" and focused on his new clothing line.
“The retired Navy SEAL Edward Gallagher has a his [sic] new apparel line called Salty Frog Gear, which is a [sic] described as a ‘coastal lifestyle brand with an edge,'” the Times wrote in the now-deleted tweet on its NYT Politics account.
The tweet failed to mention that Gallagher was acquitted in July of murder and attempted murder but was found guilty of taking a picture unlawfully with a corpse. He was accused of killing an injured teenage ISIS fighter and shooting at civilians in 2017 in Iraq.
After backlash, the New York Times announced it had deleted the tweet because it "lacked context."
Tweet
Their statement reads, “We have deleted an earlier tweet to this story that lacked context. Edward Gallagher, who was acquitted of charges that he killed a wounded captive in Iraq, later received clemency from President Trump — information that’s provided in the article.”
Since being acquitted, Gallagher has been praised by Trump on numerous occasions. The two met in Mar-a-Lago last month. Gallagher has recently launched an apparel line called Salty Frog Gear. The apparel is billed as a “coastal lifestyle brand with an edge,” which features T-shirts that read “stay salty” and hooded sweatshirts with a custom front pocket meant to hold a beer bottle.
A number of people expressed their outrage at the Times' original characterization of Gallagher on social media.

Texto completo: Carrie just didn’t want to spend Christmas alone.
She went on Craigslist and posted a listing under the title, “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas (Tulsa).” Her message was short and sad.
It read, in full: “I have nobody and would really like to be part of a family. I can cook and I can cook dinner. I’ll even bring food & gifts for the kids! I HAVE NOBODY AND IT REALLY HURTS! Let me be part of your family.”
This should be the part of the story where a big family offers to take Carrie in, she spends a wonderful day with them, and their feel-good segment on the local news goes viral. The Christmas spirit would be felt by all.
Thanks to misfits on the internet, things didn’t go according to plan.
Some responses to Carrie’s post accused her of trying to exploit another family’s Christmas goodwill. Someone even told her to commit suicide.
“I couldn’t understand why people I don’t know were being so rude and hateful to me,” Carrie told the New York Times in perhaps the most concise explication of the state of the internet in 2019. “I was crushed.” Carrie posted a follow-up on Craigslist about the responses giving her an “extra shot of pain.” She deleted the entire post.
Thankfully, one post went even more viral than Carrie’s initial one. Carson Carlock, 21, took a screenshot of Carrie's Craigslist listing and posted it on Facebook with the hashtag #FINDGRANDMA. Carlock empathized with Carrie because his mother spent her last Christmas alone, she being too ill to travel and Carlock unable to overcome car troubles for the trip. Carlock’s mom has since died of cancer.
Even after Carlock’s post went viral for all the right reasons, Carrie was hesitant to trust strangers after the internet abuse. But on Dec. 23, she met up with Carlock in Tulsa, Oklahoma, hugging and crying. They made plans for Carlock to have Christmas dinner at Carrie’s house.
Without the internet, Carrie wouldn’t have suffered abuse from strangers. But without the internet, she wouldn’t have received the even bigger outpouring of love. Maybe the internet didn’t ruin Christmas after all.

Democratic fundraising makes contested convention more likely

Texto completo: Save for a few blips in both directions, former Vice President Joe Biden spent all of 2019 dominating the Democratic presidential primary with about 30% of the vote in national polls. His support hasn't flamed out, and his competitors' cash has only grown, increasing the odds that no candidate will complete the primary season with a majority of delegates. The result would be the ever-elusive contested convention that political nerds have dreamed of for decades.
Unlike the 2016 Republican primaries, Democrats have no winner-take-all states. In most states, often subdivided into congressional districts, candidates just have to earn at least 15% of the primary vote to obtain pledged delegates. Whereas President Trump could clean up the overwhelming majority of delegates without a majority of the popular vote in the 2016 Republican primary, candidates earning at least 15% in enough districts could hold out hope that no competitor takes a majority of the total delegates.
Looking at the astounding fundraising numbers of the fourth quarter of 2019, it looks increasingly possible that there will be no presumptive nominee by the time the Democratic National Convention starts in July.
Bernie Sanders announced that he pulled in a whopping $34.5 million in donations to his presidential campaign, the most of any Democrat yet. At an impressive $24.7 million, Pete Buttigieg nearly matched his own third-quarter fundraising. Trailing closely behind is Andrew Yang, who catapulted from $10 million in fundraising in the third quarter to $16.5 million in the fourth. With $22.7 million earned since October, front-runner Joe Biden posted his best quarter yet.
Noticeably absent from the recent spate of announcements is Elizabeth Warren, whose fundraising likely fell to about $20 million.
With an intractable 30% of national primary polling support, Biden doesn't need much cash to stay viable in the race. But everyone else does, and every other candidate polling in the double digits has it. If a Buttigieg or a Yang were running in the winner-take-all primary of the Republicans in 2016 or the relatively small field of the Democrats in 2008 or 2016, they would have no incentive to stay in the race, even if they had the cash. But if they can compile tens of millions of dollars of cash on hand and delegates throughout districts, they can bet that Biden, Sanders, and Warren will simply split a majority of support.
In terms of possibly winning the nomination, Biden, Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg, and Amy Klobuchar (unless she bombs in Iowa) have no incentive to leave the primary. Yang has the cash to stay, and he and Tulsi Gabbard have the national clout to continue to earn. Billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer have bankrolled their own joyrides.
Cory Booker is failing nationally but still has ample promise as a Cabinet appointee or running mate, making him the only candidate with any incentive to bow out before the race gets ugly. He would thus earn the goodwill of the eventual nominee and could earn even more if he endorses the winner.
As for everyone else, that makes nine candidates who will likely stay in the fight deep into primary season. Unless Biden or Sanders manage to clean up the early states, it's becoming more and more likely that no single candidate will reach a majority before the convention, and a contested convention is the result.

Obituary: Gertrude Himmelfarb, 1922-2019

Texto completo: Gertrude Himmelfarb, who died last week in Washington, D.C., at 97, was everywhere described as a "historian of ideas," which is certainly true. But she was also a philosopher, essayist, and scholar who wrote about the past with one eye fixed resolutely on the present. She believed, as philosophers do, that ideas matter in life as well as in scholarship.

Scholars of ideas tend to be the great rehabilitators of history. Perry Miller of Harvard studied the Puritans during the early 20th century, when the founders of New England were in particularly bad odor among their descendants. Miller read the texts and annals of the Puritans, put his subjects in a broader perspective, and gave them new depth and relevance. A generation later, Himmelfarb did the same for the Victorians.

When, in the late 1940s, she began her studies of the intellectual life and work of Victorian England, the very term was an epithet. But she pondered the world the Victorians inhabited, grappled with the facts that shaped their ideas, and changed not only our modern perceptions but revealed that the virtues of the 19th century, including moral clarity, temperance, decency, duty, had much to teach the contemporary world.

Like the English of the mid-19th century, Himmelfarb's 20th century Americans found themselves adrift amid political turmoil and material change. For Victorians, the political challenge was the poverty described in the novels of Charles Dickens, a glaring rebuke to the progress of industry and to progress itself. For Americans, the challenge was not dissimilar: poverty and social inequality in the midst of freedom and affluence. In The Idea of Poverty (1984) and Poverty and Compassion (1991), Himmelfarb described the ways in which Victorian reformers treated poverty not as a moral failing but social misfortune, demanding social responsibility and moral instruction. The message to America and its burgeoning welfare state was no accident.

Of course, she didn't make Victorians of us all: As the New York Times noted, Himmelfarb's belief that private virtues are more consequential than public programs made her "a heroine of conservatives and a bête noire of liberals." But she was a historian, not a politician. And although her views were expressed with characteristic vigor and clarity, she aimed to educate our cynical age in what she called "the paradox of liberalism," the costs of ignoring the moral dimensions and requirements of life in the pursuit of individual liberty.

In that sense, she resembled the subject of her first great work, Lord Acton: A Study in Conscience and Politics (1952), which grew out of her doctoral dissertation on the English Catholic historian and essayist.
Historians who once regarded salvation as the automatic and inevitable byproduct of historical progress now find themselves agreeing with Acton that salvation requires an exercise of moral will, that the historian must sometimes turn his back upon the course of history and resist 'the wave of the future.'
Gertrude Himmelfarb was born in 1922 in Brooklyn to Russian immigrant parents. Her father was a glass cutter and engraver who struggled through the Depression. She was a triple major at Brooklyn College while earning another degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary. It was at a meeting of Brooklyn Trotskyites that she encountered a City College student named Irving Kristol who, decades later, described noticing "a girl ... who sat quietly at the other end of the small room. Her name was Gertrude Himmelfarb, but she was called 'Bea' ... I noticed her for some weeks before approaching her and asking her out. In truth, I was already in love with her without even knowing her ... Thus began what my friend Daniel Bell later described as 'the best marriage of our generation.'"

It was certainly one of the most consequential. In 1942, Kristol, the journalist and later "godfather of neoconservatism," accompanied his wife to the University of Chicago, where she began graduate studies in history. Both put Trotsky firmly behind them; Kristol served in World War II, and Himmelfarb earned her doctorate. In the late 1940s, she studied at Cambridge, and Kristol began editing the series of small but influential journals, in England and America, that would alter the shape of modern conservatism and politics.

The Kristols were very much a part of the midcentury gathering of thinkers and writers known as the New York Intellectuals, centered largely around magazines such as Partisan Review, Dissent, and Commentary, debating the character of American life and culture and, especially, the challenge of the Cold War to American liberalism. They were also the parents of two children, a daughter Elizabeth and son William, the political analyst and commentator and co-founder of The Weekly Standard.

By the 1960s, while Irving Kristol was chronicling the descent of liberalism into radicalism and the failures of the Great Society, Himmelfarb returned to writing about Victorian England as a mirror to our times.
In her groundbreaking study of Victorian Minds (1968), she reintroduced John Stuart Mill, Walter Bagehot, Leslie Stephen, and others to modern readers, drawing on her observation that, as in our epoch, "it was an age of severe manners and morals, and of considerable latitude in behavior ... described by one historian as an age of equipoise, by another as an age of reform, and by still another as an age of revolution; my own sense of it is best expressed in the phrase ‘conservative revolution.’”
Which for the next half-century, and well into her 90s, she proceeded to expound and illuminate in subjects as varied as manners and morals, Winston Churchill, the challenge of modernity, and George Eliot. And always with the scholar's commitment and precision. When the chairman of the University of Chicago's history department told Himmelfarb that, as a female Jewish New Yorker, she was unlikely to find a teaching job after earning her Ph.D., she was unfazed. "I was coming to the University not for professional reasons," she later explained, "but simply to have an education, an education for its own sake."

Commentary: Keep our rivers wild

Texto completo: The rivers of Chilean Patagonia cascade from snow-capped mountains through sheer rock facades and rolling hills, radiating bright turquoise, deep blues and vivid greens. The Puelo. The Pascua. The Futaleufú. Each is as breathtaking and unique as the landscape it quenches.
But these rivers, like many worldwide, have been threatened by dam projects that aim to provide power for distant cities and mining operations. Only one-third of the world’s 177 longest rivers remain free flowing, and just 21 rivers longer than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) retain a direct connection to the sea.
If we are to arrest global climate change, prevent the toxifying of freshwater sources and do right by all those who depend on rivers for survival, we must return more rivers to their natural state.
For decades, rivers have been an afterthought in global climate talks, like the ones that concluded in Madrid this month. New streams of climate finance, like the Climate Bonds Initiative, may soon be available to large-scale hydropower projects. While renewable energy and its financing are an important part of climate solutions, hydropower dams are not the answer.
Hydropower is not a clean, green technology. Rivers help regulate an increasingly volatile global carbon cycle by transporting decaying organic material from land to sea, where it settles on the ocean floor. This draws an estimated 200 million tons of carbon out of the air each year.
As an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scientist, Philip Fearnside, has documented, large dams, especially on tropical rivers like the Amazon, are “methane factories,” emitting in some cases more greenhouse gases than coal-fired power plants. This month in Madrid, 276 civil society groups attending the United Nations climate talks called on the Climate Bonds Initiative to exclude hydropower from climate financing.
Hydroelectric dams, when they are built, flood large areas of vegetation. This fuels decomposition and releases carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Considered as a whole, hydroelectric dams emit a billion tons of greenhouse gases per year. This is comparable to the aviation industry, which emitted over 900 million tons of greenhouse gases in 2018.
Damming rivers affects both people and ecosystems. More than 60 million people in developing countries depend on lakes and rivers for their livelihoods. An estimated 80 million people have already been displaced by dam projects worldwide. The United Nations estimates that around one million animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, at least in part because of damming, river pollution, diversion for industrial agriculture and overfishing.
For more than a decade, Chilean environmentalists have been fighting dam projects. In 2006, the Chilean energy corporation Endesa proposed to build five major dams in the Aysén region, a sparsely populated area in the south of Chile that is home to one of the world’s largest ice fields outside of Antarctica and Greenland.
This dam project, called HidroAysén, would have flooded nearly 15,000 acres of forests to transmit power to distant cities and to fuel the country’s copper industry, which accounts for as much as 10 percent of Chile’s G.D.P. But at what cost?
A 2009 study by the University of Chile found large dam projects unnecessary to meeting the country’s future and growing energy needs. Communities threatened by HidroAysén organized. Across Chile, thousands of people took to the streets in more than a dozen cities. Environmentalists challenged the proposed dams in courts.
In spite of the government’s initial eagerness to greenlight HidroAysén, the Committee of Ministers scuttled the project in 2014, in recognition of the significant impacts the project would have had on one of Chile’s most iconic regions.
The current movement to protect Patagonia’s free-flowing rivers stands on the shoulders of the United States Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, passed in 1968, which protects 13,413 free-flowing miles of 226 rivers in 41 states and Puerto Rico.
Several Chilean organizations are working on Ley Ríos Salvajes, a campaign to create a wild rivers law. This places Chile at the forefront countries using river protections as a means of adapting to and offsetting climate change.
Our efforts are also buoyed by recent developments that have seen legal rights granted to rivers in New Zealand and Bangladesh. Many international organizations, among them Rivers Without Boundaries and World Heritage Watch, contributed to the “Heritage Dammed” report, published in June, which calls for rivers to receive the same recognition and protection as the UNESCO World Heritage Sites they nourish.
This could grant renewed protections for some of the world’s most cherished rivers — among them the Nu-Salween and the Tigris — permanent legal protection from damming, diversion and pollution.
Countries that were the first to participate in a dam-building boom have started to dismantle or partly decommission their dams. In the United States, over 1,600 obsolete dams have been removed. The current five-year plan for economic and social development in China includes an effort to reconnect rivers, reversing years of unchecked dam construction that has contributed to the disappearance of more than half of the country’s 50,000 rivers.
We are organizing to protect Chilean rivers from a similar fate. Rivers will be irrevocably changed if the Chilean government doesn’t grant them permanent legal protection. If the global community cares about the climate, it needs to do a lot better by its rivers.

Texto completo: Most diets fail. They fail mostly because after a period of bingeing (for example, New Year’s Eve) we set unrealistic goals for ourselves to radically reform our bad ways. In time, self-control breaks down and we hunger to throw open the cupboards and binge again.
The same is true of the American carbon diet. After a period of bingeing (say, the last century), the United States is per capita the most prodigious emitter of carbon dioxide among the world’s top 10 economies. The average American generated around 15 metric tons of carbon per person per year in 2016, according to the International Energy Agency, using what it says is the most recent data available. Svelte France, by comparison, weighed in at a per capita 4.5 tons, while India put out just 1.6 tons per person per year.
To bring the planet to climate equilibrium would require a global per capita goal that falls halfway between France’s and India’s outputs at three metric tons by 2050, according to a United Nations report from 2011. All of this may make the conscientious American want to drive the family SUV into the nearest body of water and subsist on locally sourced radishes. But I am fairly certain that as with food regimens, an extreme carbon diet will falter, and practitioners will soon retrieve their SUVs and cheat so often with hamburgers that those locally sourced radishes will molder in the vegetable crisper.
But some diets do work. Effective diets tend to be modest in their goals, incorporating subtle changes paced out over long periods. That we need to radically transform the roots of our economy is unquestionable and something that must be fought for with intense social and political commitment. But inertia abounds. Not every well-meaning American will engage in a protracted political struggle. Fortunately for carbon couch potatoes, there are smaller maintainable changes that would allow many of us to go from carbon obese to just carbon overweight.
Here then is something of a grocery list for the politically inert, things that can be done without a whole lot of effort that will lead to a carbon-slimmer 2020:
Have the chicken. Much has been made about the climate benefits of going vegan. If we switched to a vegan diet, we could cut our carbon dioxide emissions between 0.3 to 1.6 metric tons per person per year. I have made this change, but I doubt I could persuade a large portion the country to choose pea protein over pot roast even when packaged as Beyond or Impossible meat. For the legume-averse, chicken is relatively low impact. According to a study published by the nonprofit Environmental Working Group, beef can cost more than 27 kilograms of carbon dioxide per kilogram of meat eaten (much, much more if you compare foods based on protein content per unit of weight). A kilo of chicken, however, costs the planet about 6.9 kilograms of carbon dioxide. True, it’s not tofu (2.0) or lentils (0.9), but most red-blooded Americans know how to cook it.
Or the fish. Fish and shellfish can make for surprisingly carbon dioxide-light meals, though not everything from the sea shrinks one’s emissions waistline. America’s favorite seafood, shrimp, can far exceed chicken and even rival pork. At the same time, a kilogram of most American-caught finfish comes in at a tofu-besting 1.6 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions. And depending on how you adjust for nutrient content, some varieties of farmed mussels can cost us just 0.6 kilograms of carbon per kilogram of mussel meat. Take that, lentil!
Do nothing better. Busy Americans fret about actually having to do something to address the climate crisis in their already hectic lives. But doing nothing better can add up to something. A 2018 study in the journal Nature notes that tourism accounts for about 8 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Just one long-haul flight emits around a half-ton of carbon per person or a full ton of greenhouse effect if one considers other gasses a jet puts into the upper atmosphere. Business and first-class air travel generates three to four tons of carbon per long haul flight because of the excessive space those fancier seats take up. So doing nothing at home for your next vacation is an easy choice. Other better nothings include turning off your car rather than letting the engine idle, which accounts for about 30 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States a year.
Change the way other things in your life do nothing. Similarly when your appliances do nothing, they are often burning fossil fuels. Standby power accounts for 4.6 percent of residential carbon emissions. Address this by turning off your internet router at night, shutting down your computer fully, unplugging your cellphone when it’s fully charged and choosing appliances that have low standby power requirements. To go beyond saving standby power, Karl Coplan, the author of “Live Sustainably Now,” suggests “depriving fossil fuel companies of their sales revenues by switching to a renewable-electricity contract and upgrading to an electric car the next chance you get.”
Be really lazy and drink from the tap. What could be a lazier thing to do than shuffling to your own sink and pouring yourself a glass of water? And yet nowadays we often replace this most low-effort of American habits with driving to a store and buying a plastic bottle of water. This can end up costing us significantly more in carbon dioxide emissions as drinking water from the tap, according to one 2009 Italian scientific analysis.
Ditch the car one day a week. Collectively Americans drive more than three trillion miles annually. (Over ten years that would take us all the way to Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to Earth.) That comes out to about 4.6 tons of carbon per vehicle a year, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Transportation is the largest single contributor to American CO2 emissions, the agency says. So skipping a day of driving each week would significantly decrease an individual's per capita contribution to emissions.
Upgrade a forest instead of your phone. A smartphone does not carry a huge carbon burden. Apple reports that a single iPhone 11 results in the emission of about 70 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions over its life cycle. But if you repurposed the several hundred dollars you typically spent on a phone upgrade and donated those funds to a program managing a carbon sequestering ecosystem, you could shave a much greater portion of carbon from your budget. For the best possible carbon sink, consider the mangrove. Mangrove forests are one of the world’s most powerful carbon sinks; those in the Amazon store twice as much carbon per acre as the region’s rain forests.
Make a personal divestment from fossil fuels All of us are implicated in the carbon economy through our daily financial transactions. The title of a recent New Yorker essay by the climate activist Bill McKibben read, “Money Is the Oxygen on Which the Fire of Global Warning Burns.” How to address this? “Switching to a fossil-free index fund is a no-brainer — among other things they’re outperforming the market,” Mr. McKibben wrote me recently. For those who don’t invest but do own a credit card and a bank account, Mr. McKibben suggested going a step further. “As we approach Earth Day at 50, cut up your Chase card or move your money to a new bank — JPMorgan Chase has become by far the largest funder of the fossil fuel industry.”
Here lies the truly profound global effect of the carbon-obese American economy, according to data compiled in a recently released “Fossil Fuel Finance Report Card” by a group of environmental organizations. Four of the world’s five largest institutional investors in fossil fuels are banks headquartered here in the U.S.A.

Texto completo: The 2010s were a transformative decade for women in politics. But the biggest trend has been obscured by 2018’s female-led Democratic wave in Congress: G.O.P. women, at both the national and state levels, are on the brink of extinction.
Republicans will ring in the new year with only 13 women in the House of Representatives, the lowest number since 1993, and eight women in the Senate. (There are, for comparison, 88 Democratic women in the House and 17 Democratic women in the Senate.)
The prospects for Republican women looked quite different at the decade’s start. Pundits heralded 2010 as the Year of the Republican Woman. In a speech that spring, Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, touted her endorsements for the election of “common-sense conservative women.”
“Look out, Washington, because there’s a whole stampede of pink elephants crossing the line,” she said.
For a moment, it seemed that Ms. Palin and her pack of “Mama Grizzlies” would become the prime beneficiaries of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. Yet as 2020 begins, Republicans have Ms. Palin and her brand of right-wing populism — revived and carried on by Donald Trump — to thank for the endangered state of the Republican woman.
The first casualties of Ms. Palin’s pro-woman campaign were some of the G.O.P.’s most influential and respected female leaders. Even though Ms. Palin promoted herself as the leader of a new conservative feminism, she went on the attack, endorsing men against both Kay Bailey Hutchison, who resigned her Senate seat to run for governor of Texas, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Senate incumbent. (Ms. Palin’s candidate in Texas, Rick Perry, defeated Ms. Hutchison. Ms. Palin’s candidate in Alaska won the Republican primary, but Ms. Murkowski prevailed as a write-in candidate in the general election.)
To be sure, Palin’s 2010 support did give a boost to some female Republican candidates for Congress. Republican women increased their numbers in the House to 24 from 17; Ms. Palin had endorsed six of the nine new congresswomen, as well as the one new Senator, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire.
Likewise, Ms. Palin’s endorsements helped Republican women running for governor. Nikki Haley and Susana Martinez won competitive primaries in South Carolina and New Mexico, respectively, and became the first women of color ever elected governor.
Yet Ms. Hutchison’s and Ms. Murkowski’s experiences were harbingers of the troubles ahead for Republican women. In 2012, female voters, outraged over G.O.P. attacks on Planned Parenthood and access to birth control, powered President Barack Obama to re-election and denied Republicans two winnable Senate seats. Republican women’s representation in Congress decreased by 21 percent, while Democratic women increased theirs by 26 percent.
Acknowledging the party’s mistakes with female voters, the G.O.P. fielded female candidates in the 2014 midterms who could appeal more broadly. These candidates downplayed their social conservatism and leaned in to their biographies as glass-breaking female leaders. In 2014, Martha McSally, the nation’s first female fighter pilot to serve in combat, won the Republican primary in a swing district in Arizona. Elise Stefanik, then the youngest congresswoman ever elected, was chosen to be co-chairwoman of the party’s moderate caucus.
With the exception of her endorsement of Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, Ms. Palin played a minor role in the 2014 midterm victories. Her days as queen-maker seemed over. Most signs suggested that Republican pragmatism would prevail going forward.
The rise of Donald Trump eliminated any chance of that. The signs of women’s disillusionment with the party were immediate. One day after President Trump’s inauguration, an estimated four million people, mostly women, participated in hundreds of women’s marches throughout the United States. In the months that followed, women mobilized to defeat Republicans at the federal, state and local levels.
In the 2018 midterms, every Republican congresswoman from the 2014 class except for Ms. Stefanik lost. Martha McSally was defeated, though she was appointed by Arizona’s Republican governor to fill John McCain’s Senate seat after Mr. McCain died. She faces a tough election battle in 2020.
Despite winning three governors’ races and one open Senate seat in 2018, Republican women will end the decade with their governors and senators outnumbered two to one by their Democratic counterparts. Three of the four current female Republican senators running in 2020 face highly competitive elections in 2020. There are more than six times as many Democratic women as Republican women in the House.
Granted, Republicans — both men and women — have suffered dramatic losses in elections at national, state and local levels since 2016; they have lost control of the House, eight governorships and nine state legislative chambers since Mr. Trump’s election. But female Republican candidates and officeholders face an existential threat.
Mr. Trump’s misogyny and the party’s far-right stance on issues such as abortion and L.G.B.T.Q. rights, guns and immigration have driven away many female voters. Women favor the Democratic Party over the Republican Party by a 19-point margin, according to the Pew Research Center. Seventy-three percent of women under the age of 30 disapprove of the president’s performance, according to the Harvard Institute of Politics Youth Poll.
Suburban and college-educated white women, once reliable Republican voters, have fled the party in droves since Mr. Trump’s election. According to the Brookings Institution, white college educated women increased their vote for Democrats by 13 points between 2016 and 2018. Among women, only white evangelicals remain firmly committed to the G.O.P. and Mr. Trump.
The alienation of female voters from the Republican Party is compounded by the indifference, at best, of Republican men to female candidates.
Together, these two trends have decimated the ranks of Republican women officeholders.
The party’s veer to the right over the 2010s has placed nearly all Republican women with political ambition in a precarious position. Not surprisingly, in this environment, Republican women are reluctant to step up as candidates. This is a rational decision, some political science research shows. Other studies suggest that G.O.P. voters perceive women to be more moderate than men and are therefore less likely to vote for women. Small wonder that Representative Susan Brooks, the head of the Republicans’ House recruitment efforts for the next election cycle, will herself not seek re-election in 2020.
To survive, most Republican women have tethered themselves to President Trump. Senator Susan Collins, a onetime moderate with a bipartisan record, provided the deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She will face Maine voters in 2020 as the nation’s second-most-unpopular senator. Ms. Stefanik emerged in the Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry as one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken defenders. Mr. Trump took notice, tweeting, “A new Republican Star is born.”
Yet not all female Republican politicians have thrown in their lot with the president. Senator Lisa Murkowski opposed Kavanaugh’s confirmation and is the only G.O.P. senator thus far to have broken ranks over the process for the Senate’s impeachment trial.
In the House, at least six Republican congresswomen have maintained some distance from the president. Well aware of how Mr. Trump’s demands for loyalty have endangered their colleagues, they have tended to lie low, neither publicly embracing nor criticizing Mr. Trump, while consistently voting in line with his positions.
Several of these Republican congresswomen represent suburban areas. A few — Ann Wagner of Missouri, Jackie Walorski of Indiana and Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington — restarted the G.O.P. suburban caucus in November. In an effort to appeal to working suburban women, they focus on issues like paid maternity leave and the cost of child care.
The handful of congresswomen who have never fully embraced Mr. Trump and Trumpism are the party’s best hope for a renewed appeal to women voters.
Right now, there are hardly enough of them to field a softball team.
Should Mr. Trump lose re-election, these Republican women could provide the leadership for rebuilding the party among women. If Mr. Trump wins, given his unpopularity with female voters, the future for Republican women in politics looks very bleak indeed.

Texto completo: After the turn of the millennium, the United States suffered its weakest decade of economic growth in the post-World War II era, and served as ground zero of the global financial crisis. Forecasters predicted a long American decline. Instead, over the course of the 2010s, the United States staged a comeback as an economic superpower and, even more, as a financial superpower.
The United States economy grew faster than other rich countries and navigated the decade without suffering a single recession — a first since records began in the 1850s. Defying the declinists, the United States was one of only two major countries, alongside China, to expand its share of the global economy in the 2010s.
With central banks, consumers and investors around the world increasingly eager to hold dollars, the greenback ruled global money flows as never before. The American stock market rose 200 percent in the 2010s while the rest of the world’s stock markets, including those of China and Germany, registered meager gains. Today, seven of the world’s 10 largest companies by stock market value are American, up from three in late 2009.
But if history is a guide, the 2020s will be anything but another American decade. Economic trends that define one decade rarely define the next. This cycle has repeated itself throughout the postwar era.
America was the hottest story in the world economy and markets in the 1960s, but gave way to emerging nations in the 1970s and Japan in the 1980s before rising again in the 1990s. After the turn of the millennium, emerging nations made another strong run, and by 2010 forecasters were predicting that emerging markets would be the story of the next century.
Excluding China, emerging countries as a group saw their share of the global economy shrink during the 2010s. The average annual gain for emerging stock markets was close to zero, their worst decade since the 1930s.
Why does this cycle play out in such a predictable way? The answer is straightforward. After a good run national leaders grow complacent and start spending irresponsibly; businesses and consumers run up debts; investors end up overpaying for stocks; and the dominant companies get lethargic and fall back into the pack.
The United States at the dawn of the 2020s is a complacent land with a rising government deficit, spreading corporate debts and swollen prices not only for the stock of megacorporations like Amazon and Alphabet but also for financial assets of all kinds.
Meanwhile, many other countries, particularly in the emerging world, were forced by pressing financial circumstances to spend the last decade reducing deficits and debt, and enacting reforms that should put their economies in a position to grow more rapidly. Quietly, global economic forces are shifting in ways that could set the stage for a comeback by smaller nations and businesses in the 2020s.
As the United States and China battle to contain each other, their titanic struggle is scaring off trade and investment that is instead shifting to smaller countries, including Vietnam, Taiwan, Mexico, the Netherlands and Ireland. To insulate themselves from the superpower trade war, nations like Brazil and Japan are signing regional and bilateral trade deals.
The big American tech companies, in contrast, face a global regulatory backlash against their monopolistic power. These giants have bought out smaller rivals and driven many out of business. But they also enable many others because their platforms allow millions of entrepreneurs to reach wide audiences, often catering to specific national or regional tastes.
It used to be that big companies competed for limited shelf space in retail stores by winning consumer trust in multiyear, multibillion-dollar TV ad campaigns. Now, internet platforms allow small companies to bypass stores, win public trust instantly through consumer reviews, and build a brand on cheap internet ads, even free YouTube videos.
Globalization is thus gradually giving way to localization, which makes this a promising time for countries with domestic markets large enough to support significant expansion in local businesses. That’s especially true of countries where the population is still relatively young and fast growing, like Indonesia, the Philippines, Egypt and Mexico.
Though stock markets worldwide are still dominated by “mega caps” — companies with a market value or “capitalization” above $200 billion — they face an emerging challenge from companies below that threshold. In finance, the hottest companies are digital payment apps and the small banks that back them. In insurance, the hot subsector is mobile internet insurance services — “insurtech.”
The fastest-growing American food and beverage manufacturers are small ones. Search “ketchup,” an American staple once virtually synonymous with a single brand, and you will find more than 680 results including local purveyors selling flavors such as bacon. Driven by apps that serve as gateways to food delivery services, a similar rise of the solo chef is underway worldwide.
Many internet platforms also provide cloud computing, which allows entrepreneurs to build back-office operations like customer relations and bill collection much more quickly and cheaply. Barriers to entry are falling, particularly since many of the hottest internet companies own few physical assets. Uber, the world’s largest taxi company, owns no taxis — but that means future rivals won’t have to buy them either.
At the same time, the rise of populist nationalism is injecting patriotic fervor into “buy local” movements. In an October survey, Chinese consumers cited “national loyalty” as the main reason they would “rethink U.S. brands.” An ad from an Indian food company urged customers to “perform your patriotic duties” and “boycott products made in China, USA, UK & Europe.”
These forces conspire to unseat the global giants, which are mainly American. The United States market accounts for well over half of the global value of stock markets, and has never been more expensive relative to other national markets. But remember, churn is the norm. Among the world’s 10 largest companies today, only one (Microsoft) was on the top 10 list in December 2009.
If the usual pattern holds, it’s likely that America will peak and smaller nations and companies will make a comeback. If the 2010s were a golden age for the world’s largest economy and its megacorporations, the 2020s are likely to be remembered as the decade when smaller was beautiful again.

Texto completo: Kenneth Cuccinelli, a top immigration official in the Trump administration, faced blowback Monday after saying the man accused of stabbing five Orthodox Jews in New York was the son of an “illegal alien” and came from a family lacking “American values.”
Little was known about Grafton Thomas, the suspect in the attack in Monsey, New York, when Cuccinelli, the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, took to Twitter to say that Thomas’ father came to the country illegally but gained amnesty under a far-reaching immigration bill signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986.
“Apparently, American values did not take hold among this entire family, at least this one violent, and apparently bigoted, son,” Cuccinelli wrote in a tweet that was deleted shortly after its posting. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Citizenship and Immigration Services, did not immediately answer questions seeking clarity on the source or accuracy of the information or the purpose of releasing it.
Cuccinelli’s statement came as federal prosecutors filed hate crimes charges against Thomas in the attack, which took place at a rabbi’s house during a Hanukkah celebration on Saturday.

Some inside and outside the Department of Homeland Security were appalled by the message, which drew a connection between the citizenship status of the suspect’s family and the gruesome crime. They said it was highly unusual to reveal the immigration records of a suspect’s family to the public during the early stages of an investigation.
David Lapan, a former department spokesman in the Trump administration, accused Cuccinelli of “fear-mongering” and sending a political message to Stephen Miller, the architect of hard-line immigration policies at the White House.
“I see no relevance at all, especially today at this early stage, and that’s what’s really distasteful,” Lapan said. “Inside 48 hours of this horrific incident happening he’s already trying to leverage it for his own and Stephen Miller’s own agenda on immigration.”
Michael H. Sussman, a lawyer representing Thomas, said at a news conference that it was “absurd” for a politician to try to link the stabbings to immigration policy.
“It’s more than regrettable that the events of 30-plus years ago are in any way linked to this,” Sussman said, responding to a question about Cuccinelli’s tweet. He said that Thomas’ father has lived in Utah for many years and that the two had been in touch but did not have an extensive relationship.
“Why anyone would, in a sense, stretch and try to make this in any way about immigration is, for me, absurd,” Sussman said.
He also said that Kim Thomas, Thomas’ mother and a nurse, had immigrated to the United States from Guyana and became a citizen in 1986.
Cuccinelli has been one of President Donald Trump’s most outspoken defenders on immigration and has been at the forefront of some of the president’s aggressive efforts to restrict migration to the United States.
He has faced criticism for other comments on immigration. Cuccinelli, who oversees legal immigration, said in August that an iconic sonnet on the Statue of Liberty referred to “people coming from Europe where they had class-based societies,” while defending a rule that would deny legal status to immigrants deemed likely to use government benefit programs. When a photograph showing a migrant father and his daughter drowned on the banks of the Rio Grande went viral in June, Cuccinelli blamed the father for their deaths.
On multiple occasions, he has used his official Twitter account to highlight crimes committed by immigrants in so-called sanctuary cities represented by Democratic lawmakers. Many studies have debunked the theory that immigration drives crime.
Lapan said Miller and others in the White House would often push homeland security officials to cherry-pick data that highlighted crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants as a way to target cities led by Democrats.
Gil Kerlikowske, a commissioner with Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, said it was normal to search through homeland security databases to find the immigration and travel records of suspects of significant crimes. But he said it was highly unusual to publicize such information.
“It’s a good practice when it’s used for law enforcement and investigative purposes,” Kerlikowske said. “To use that information in any other way is not only unprofessional but really unethical.”

Gail Collins: Already had enough of Trump for 2020?

Texto completo: We’re now officially trudging through the new year. (And good luck on that healthier-living resolution.) This is when we adjust to the fact that nothing has changed. You weren’t allowed to toss Donald Trump out with the old. Although it would have been nice if he’d at least have stayed quiet until all of the Christmas trees were down.
Instead, he’s holding a big, presumably loud, rally Friday in Miami for evangelical supporters. It’s supposed to be a response to the editorial in Christianity Today that called him “morally lost and confused.”
Lost? How can you call the man lost? He’s there … in the place he’s at.
The site of the rally, the King Jesus International Ministry church, has a large Hispanic congregation, and Pastor Guillermo Maldonado has told his parishioners to come to hear Trump’s speech even if they “don’t have papers.”
Explaining his confidence, Maldonado just said “I’m not that dumb.” Perhaps he’s been following the record of Trump’s businesses, which have been rather low energy about checking for unauthorized workers. His Virginia winery just got around to firing some longtime employees this week. Of course that had nothing to do with the difficulty getting other people to do the low-wage backbreaking labor. It was just … slow paperwork.
But about politics in 2020: For Trump, right now it’s pretty much one rally after another. And the Democrats still have 15 presidential candidates. How many can you name? To be fair, I’ll give you a passing grade if you can get to 12.
Trump might know less. At his rallies, he generally just mentions Elizabeth Warren (“Crazy Pocahontas”), Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, whose last name he enjoys making fun of.
He calls Biden “Sleepy Joe,” which is sort of dangerous given Biden’s proclivity for challenging critics to push-up competitions. And Trump will never give up on the story about Biden family corruption in Ukraine, since the only downside to his version is its total inaccuracy.
We’ve still got nearly two weeks to wait before the next Democratic debate, which happens to be the same night as a newly scheduled Trump rally in Wisconsin. Where, I would be willing to place a small bet, the subject will be the wonderfulness of Donald Trump.
“You’re about to hear the greatest speech you’ve ever heard,” he told the crowd at his most recent rally, in Battle Creek, Michigan, right after reminiscing about how he won the state in 2016 and how, a decade or so before, he was named Man of the Year in Michigan. “Can you believe it?” he asked.
Well, actually no. FactCheck.org looked into the matter and determined Trump was “referring to a 2013 dinner hosted by a county Republican Party organization, which presented him with token gifts — including a statuette of Abraham Lincoln.” But apparently Trump did not get any special commendations, let alone a “man of the year” award.
I don’t think our president should just let this kind of back talk go unchallenged. Let’s send Rudy Giuliani to Michigan to investigate.
Ah, Rudy. Can’t really plunge into 2020 without taking a bet on what he’ll do next. He seems to be running many of the government’s most critical foreign policy initiatives despite the fact that he is (A) Not a government employee; (B) Doing private business with many of the movers and shakers involved; and (C) At best, borderline nuts.
What do you think will happen with Giuliani in the new year? Cabinet appointment? FBI indictment? Relocation to a drying-out clinic? Hey, maybe all three. At the same time. Anything’s possible in this administration.
Safe prediction for 2020 is that Trump will spend most of it bragging about the economy — unless something happens to the economy, in which case he will focus on his second-biggest achievement, which would be, um, perhaps helping nail down the 2028 Summer Olympics.
In Michigan, Trump told his supporters how a man had come up and reported that his wife always thought he was a loser until his 401(k) started climbing: “I’m up 72%, sir. She thinks I’m a financial genius. She’s so in love with me.”
Two short comments, one of which is that this doesn’t sound like a very secure marriage. The other is that when Trump starts telling stories, virtually everybody he quotes calls him “Sir.” Do you think anybody gets a dispensation? Rudy? Jared? Well, probably Melania.
There are bound to be a few things that are new for the new year. For instance, he’s just started slamming environmentalism by decrying the evils of reduced water consumption. (“You want to wash your hands, you turn on the sink, no water comes out.”)
On the night he was being impeached — that would be during the Michigan rally — Trump went on a rant about low-flow toilets that he claimed required flushing “10 times.” He then pointed to a supporter in the crowd and said: “Not me, of course, not me. But you. Him.”
Do you think that guy went home and told his family that the president of the United States picked him out as a person who required a lot of water when he went to the bathroom? Would he have been astonished? Embarrassed? Horrified?
Whatever it was, sir, we all know how you feel.

Texto completo: The new year is here, and online, the forecast calls for several seasons of hell. Tech giants and the media have scarcely figured out all that went wrong during the last presidential election — viral misinformation, state-sponsored propaganda, bots aplenty, all of us cleaved into our own tribal reality bubbles — yet here we go again, headlong into another experiment in digitally mediated democracy.
I’ll be honest with you: I’m terrified. I spend a lot of my time looking for edifying ways of interacting with technology. In the last year, I’ve told you to meditate, to keep a digital journal, to chat with people on the phone and to never tweet. Still, I enter the new decade with a feeling of overwhelming dread. There’s a good chance the internet will help break the world this year, and I’m not confident we have the tools to stop it.
Unless, that is, we are all really careful. As Smokey Bear might say of our smoldering online discourse: Only you can prevent dystopia!
And so: Here are a few tips for improving the digital world in 2020.
Virality is a red flag. Suspect it.
If I were king of the internet, I would impose an ironclad rule: No one is allowed to share any piece of content without waiting a day to think it over.
Virality was once the delightful miracle of a networked age; you’d see a funny video going around, get caught up in the collective wonder and hilarity, and forward it on to your 100 closest pals. At its meme-ified best, participating in this sort of viral feast felt like a boon to collective social bonding. Remember, kids, that one glorious day we were all talking about the crazy dress? What times, what times!
But, The Dress notwithstanding, in the 2010s virality got too easy, and then it grew sour, venal and dishonest. Nobody’s counting, but by my unscientific estimate almost everything that became instantly popular online in the last decade turned out to be problematic in one way or another. That photo of the shark washed onto a freeway by a hurricane? Fake. The culture-war-defining outrage your aunt just posted to Facebook? Debunked, of course. The suddenly popular influencer? A “milkshake duck” running from his past.
Social networks and even governments are looking into ways to curb viral misinformation, but this fight will define our age. The root of the problem is that humans are weak, gullible dolts; every day many of us, even people who should know better — folks with fancy jobs and blue check marks next to our handles — keep falling for online hoaxes. Virality hijacks our better instincts, and because so many of the internet’s business models benefit from instant popularity, there’s a great deal of money and power riding on our failings.
There is only one long-term fix: that a critical number of us alter how we approach viral content. Let’s all consciously embark on a mindset shift. In 2020, question anything that everyone’s talking about, especially if it fits all your priors or there’s some kind of ad money involved. (Hint: There’s always ad money involved.) If you can’t stop sharing, at least slow your roll. The stakes are enormous; there’s no room for error. Strive to be better, please.
Resist the easy dunk.
In the 2010s, Twitter became the center of the political universe. In some ways this was for the better — Twitter is a haven for righteous activism against the global powers that be — but most times, it was for the worse. Twitter is a daily toxic nightmare of reflexive egotism and groupthink that will prompt you to question your priorities, not to mention your sanity.
Which is why, if you’re on Twitter and can’t muster the will to never tweet, you should at least consider it your duty in 2020 to resist the network’s worst impulses, for your sake and all of ours, too.
What’s Twitter’s most damaging sin? I say it’s the too-easy mocking joke — what’s known, in the jargon, as the “quote-tweet dunk.”
Here are two canonical examples:
This scurrilous maneuver works like so: You spot an easily ridiculed tweet by a member of some rival social or political tribe. Like a 1990s fourth grader with phasers set to “Moded!” you add a pithy rejoinder that’s sure to please your side. It’s best if you elide context, depth or any intention of dialogue; just straight-up make fun of the person. Then mash on the retweet button to broadcast your supposedly clever jape.
The mechanism is part of the problem — when you quote-tweet someone on Twitter, the service shows off your remark to your own followers while leaving the original poster’s followers in the dark. (Another Twitter feature, the Reply, lets followers of both users see a response.) If Twitter is a cocktail party, the quote-tweet dunk is the equivalent of overhearing a guy across the room say something ridiculous, then inviting the whole room to point and giggle at the idiot over there. The imbalance discourages any possibility of meaningful conversation and reduces all of political discourse to empty, shallow quippery.
The thing about the quote-tweet dunk is that it can feel incredibly intoxicating; in the heat of some white-hot political moment, it’s always tempting to shoot the fish in the barrel and watch the Likes roll in. I swore off dunks years ago, but I still find myself aping Michael Jordan now and again.
Twitter could instantly improve itself by removing quote-tweet as a feature. Failing that, take the oath with me: If the joke’s too obvious to resist, let it go.
Find a well-moderated corner of the internet.
It can sometimes seem as if all the internet is deepfakes and culture wars, Trump tweets and influencer scams. It’s not, of course. The internet still abounds in lovely, wholesome niches — the fantasy sports circles, the YouTube and Instagram communities devoted to any kind of craft, the many subreddits in which strangers come together to help one another out of real problems in life.
What distinguishes the productive online communities from the disturbing ones? Often it’s something simple: content moderation. The best places online are bounded by clear, well-enforced community guidelines for participation. Twitter and Facebook are toxic because there are few rules and few penalties for flouting them. A Reddit community like r/relationships, meanwhile, is a haven of incredible, empathetic discussion because its hosts spend a lot of effort policing the discussion toward productive dialogue.
This gets at the plain truth of the internet: A better digital world takes work. It’s work all of us should do.

Texto completo: It's 2020. Do you know where your next job is?
Or are you one of those very special people who love their current job and would never ever thinking of changing? We have a name for people like this. We call them "weirdos."
For everyone else, the idea of a new job or even a totally new career is always simmering right below the surface. What can bring this slow simmer to a boil?
A bright, shiny new year.
If a change in your employment status ranks high on your list of New Year's resolutions, resolve to take a gander at "Thinking About a Job or Career Change? Read This," a recent article by Tim Herrera in The New York Times.
The article starts the ball rolling with a provocative question -- "Are you doing what you actually want to be doing?"
Though Herrera admits it is "one of the toughest questions we'll grapple with in our lives," I believe a better question is -- would you do what you are doing if you weren't paid for doing it?
Unless you have some deep-seated need to be hammered on by an overpaid, undereducated louse of a manager, the answer will be "probably not." (If the answer is "absolutely yes," please send me your resume immediately. I've been looking for someone like you for a very long time.)
Assuming a change does seem attractive, Herrera introduces us to Art Markman, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the author of the book, "Bring Your Brain to Work."
I must confess this title did not appeal to me. On any given workday, you may find me at my desk, but my brain is at home, eating salty snacks and binge-watching "The Politician."
For those who do occasionally participate in Bring Your Brain to Work days, you may be surprised to know that "the average worker will spend roughly 80,000 hours at work over the course of her working life."
Eighty-thousand hours isn't nearly enough to grasp the wonderfulness of "The Politician," but when it comes to spending time in a job you hate, it could motivate you to consider a change. But consider thoughtfully. You don't want to jump from the frying pan to the fire and from the fire to the Instapot and from the Instapot to the Breville Joule Sous Vide, 1100 Watts, All White -- at this writing, $144.95 at Amazon.
In the opinion of our authors, the decision to make a change requires "thinking about your values" and finding a job that "fits that core set of values you have."
For those of us who shed our values the instant we received our first paycheck, it may be difficult to come up with even one itsy-bitsy tiny value. (If this is your situation, take one of mine -- value sloth, especially when it comes with a ridiculous amount of disproportional remuneration.)
Assuming you have absolutely no interest in "putting time into genuine, honest introspection," Herrera suggests that a simpler way to approach the decision is to ask yourself, "What are the situations that make me feel terrible, and what do they have in common?"
If you feel terrible when given an assignment that requires effort and carries with it an expectation that you will actually produce results, you will know that the right job for you requires only that you show up, look pretty and breathe regularly.
In other words, get ready for your new career as an HR professional.
If it turns out that one of your core values is making money, instantly banish this thought from your mind. Studies have shown "that money starts to offer diminishing happiness returns once a salary reaches about $75,000."
It's not that simple. For example, you may be quite content with earning $75,000 until you learn that your co-worker earns $75,001. But Herrera is sticking with his story, insisting that "you can't spend your way out of doing something that makes you genuinely miserable."
I suggest you test this theory. Go ahead! Make 2020 the year you get yourself a new job. It doesn't matter what you do as long as it pays $150,000, or maybe $500,000, or maybe a cool mill after taxes, with 26 weeks of vacation and a Gulfstream III thrown in for good measure.
Keep at this job for 10 years, and then see how you feel. If you're still miserable in 2030, you can start thinking about a change.

Texto completo: Aunque los estados que ofrecen licencias de conducir a indocumentados afirman que no comparten los datos con la agencia de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas ( ICE ), sus esfuerzos no siempre podrían ser exitosos, ya que la orden de un juez podría obligarlos a abrir esa información a los oficiales.
Este debate toma un nuevo sentido tras el anuncio del secretario de Seguridad Nacional, Chad Wolf , de buscar la forma en que las agencias migratorias puedan acceder a datos que permitan ubicar a indocumentados .
Las disposiciones en Nueva York y Nueva Jersey, por ejemplo, prohíben que los funcionarios estatales del Departamento de Vehículos Motorizados ( DMV ) proporcionen datos a las agencias que hacen cumplir la ley de inmigración, pero son claras en obedecer una orden judicial. Lo que no queda claro es si ICE podría revisar toda la base de datos o solamente por casos específicos.
No son recientes los esfuerzos de ‘La Migra’ por acceder a información sobre indocumentados, ya que en julio pasado The New York Times reveló que, sin el conocimiento los automovilistas, los funcionarios migratorios utilizaban las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales para aplicar tecnología de reconocimiento facial.
Al menos en Utah , Vermont y Washington –que ofrecen licencias de conducir a inmigrantes indocumentados– los oficiales de ICE habían solicitado revisar la información de los automovilistas. En las primeras dos entidades se logró el acceso.
Los documentos que exponen estos tipos de búsqueda fueron obtenidos a través de solicitudes de registros públicos por el Centro de Privacidad y Tecnología de Georgetown Law y reportados por primera vez por The Washington Post.
Esa fue la primera vez que se confirma que ICE utiliza tecnología de reconocimiento facial para escanear las bases de datos de licencias de conducir estatales , incluidas fotos de residentes legales y ciudadanos, considerado como un escándalo por activistas que lucha por la protección de la privacidad.

Leonhardt: Reality-TV primary process is absurd

Texto completo: Andrew Yang began his closing statement at the most recent Democratic debate with a charming bit of self-deprecation: “I know what you’re thinking, America. How am I still on this stage with them?”
Yang has never been elected to any office. He is a businessman who has never run a major company. Even so, he is one of the Democratic Party’s seven leading candidates for an election that everybody agrees is desperately important. The other six on the debate stage included another businessman who has never held office and a mayor who has never won an election with more than 10,991 votes.
As funny as Yang’s line may have been, he was highlighting a real problem: Our process for selecting presidential nominees is badly flawed.
It is, as Jonathan Rauch and Ray La Raja recently wrote in the Atlantic, “a spectacle that would have struck earlier generations as ludicrous.” It has come to resemble a reality television show, in which a pseudo-scientific process (polls plus donor numbers) winnows the field. The winner is then chosen by a distorted series of primaries and caucuses: The same few states always get outsize influence, and a crude, unranked voting system can produce a nominee whom most people don’t want.
No wonder the current president is a reality-television star, not to mention the most unfit occupant of the office in our country’s history. “The victory of Donald Trump in 2016 is best understood as a failure of the process,” political scientist Jonathan Bernstein has written, “and a failure of the Republican Party to prevent an outsider from taking its presidential nomination — the most important thing that U.S. political parties have.”
The current system may seem as if it’s simply an expression of democracy, but it’s not. It’s one version of democracy. And it’s one that virtually no other country uses. In other democracies, political parties have more sway in selecting the nominee, and voters then choose among the major nominees. Until recently, the United States also gave party leaders a larger role in selecting nominees.
Today’s leaders have abdicated this job, afraid to do anything that might appear elitist because it substitutes the judgment of experts for that of ordinary citizens. The irony is that the new process may actually do a poorer job of picking nominees whom ordinary citizens like, as research by Dennis Spies and André Kaiser, looking across countries, suggests.
How could this be? When voters are given the dominant role in choosing a nominee — as with primaries here — only an unrepresentative subset tends to participate, which skews the process. Party leaders, on the other hand, have a big incentive to choose a broadly liked candidate. Just think about American history: Nominees chosen by party leaders have included Abraham Lincoln, both Roosevelts and Dwight Eisenhower.
I’m not suggesting we return to the smoke-filled rooms of the past. But the current process puts a higher priority on the appearance of democracy than the reality of it. We’re left with candidates fighting to do well enough in early polls to get into the debates and then to win 30% of the vote in Iowa and New Hampshire, which can launch them toward the nomination.
A better approach would balance snapshots of popular opinion with rules more likely to produce strong, qualified nominees.
The first change should be to the debates. The candidates’ electoral history and qualifications currently count for nothing. The 2020 Democratic field, for example, has included four two-term governors, all of whom have been excluded from debates despite a track record of winning votes and governing successfully. In their place have been candidates, like Yang, who managed to crack 4% in a few polls.
It makes more sense for only the true polling leaders to be guaranteed debate slots. Beyond them, the party could set aside at least one spot for a governor and perhaps one for a senator from a large state or swing state.
A second set of changes would involve the primaries themselves. More states should adopt ranked-choice voting, allowing voters to list their second and third choices. Memphis, Minneapolis, New York City, San Francisco and the state of Maine, among other places, have adopted this system for some elections.
Ranked choice can prevent the Trump phenomenon during the 2016 Republican primaries. Trump may have solid Republican support today, but he didn’t back then. Even though most Republican voters opposed him, his dedicated base let him emerge from a large field.
It’s also past time to end the special treatment that Iowa and New Hampshire receive, by always voting first. They are two overwhelmingly white, disproportionately baby boomer states (and the fact that Iowa voted for Barack Obama in 2008 doesn’t give it a permanent pass). The primary calendar should instead rotate every four years, with the first states always including a mix of states: big and small, young and old, urban and rural, coastal and heartland.
The seven candidates who made the last Democratic debate stage all have their strengths, but as a group, they offer an indictment of the nomination process. There are three candidates in their 70s — and no African American or Latino. There are two people who have never won an election — and zero who have ever run a state.
Of course, the biggest sign that the process is broken isn’t any of those seven. It is the man in the Oval Office.

Accuracy matters in 2020 census push

Texto completo: Stand up and be counted. In Minnesota, that looks like a daunting challenge for the 2020 census. In many other states, a fair tally seems more like a dare than a promise.
The Census Bureau requires some 8,000 temporary workers to pull off the decennial head count across Minnesota. To get there, officials had expected to sift through 38,000 applications by the end of January.
So far, only about a third of that number have applied, despite pay of up to $27.50 an hour in Hennepin County. The culprit: The strongest job market in years for people looking elsewhere for permanent full-time jobs.
"At some point the census can't … progress if we don't have people to do this work. So to me it's really serious," state demographer Susan Brower told the Star Tribune. "Any barriers that are brought about because of a lack of people to do this work is going to have a serious impact on the census overall."
Even before the hiring problem emerged, the Urban Institute warned that Minnesota -- a state with a projected population of more than 5.7 million -- could miss as many as 29,500 people in the decennial count.
If so, an undercount here would be happenstance. In other parts of the country, overlooking residents appears to be more by design.
In states largely led by Democrats, governments are spending extra money to give the census a better chance of counting every last soul living within their borders. California and 25 other states have earmarked an unprecedented sum -- almost a third of a billion -- to supplement census count efforts with everything from door-to-door pamphleteering to sophisticated advertising and market campaigns.
Thanks to Democratic prodding, some $1.4 billion in census funds cut by the Trump White House were restored to the federal budget in a December agreement.
Encouraging an accurate count means big money. The federal government apportions about $675 billion for schools, roads, hospitals and other public works with the aid of census numbers. How many seats a state can claim in the U.S. House, as well as Electoral College votes, relies on the same figures, and Brower said this week that she's "less confident" Minnesota can hang on to its eight seats based on new projections, although it's not "impossible."
"Red states," nevertheless, are largely shunning any effort to encourage a complete census head count, the New York Times reported. "The political divide is stark: Seventeen of those 24 are led by Republican governors and legislatures, including population heavyweights like Texas, Florida and Ohio. But of the 26 states that are spending money, only four are Republican-controlled."
Republicans appear fearful which hard-to-reach residents might be found by the census -- immigrants, legal or illegal, minorities and millions of poor people who live on the fringes of society.
It may sound unfair to charge Republicans with discouraging a census count that would give states with big cities a greater voice in Congress -- and in state legislatures. But consider other hurdles Trump and his allies have placed before the 2020 census. White House attempts to pare the census budget. The census director's job unfilled for more than a year in the run-up to the count. A failed attempt to add a "citizenship question" to the census, which likely would have discouraged cooperation from Latinos and other immigrants.
Boosting the census count in Minnesota should be a duty, even if politicians in other states ignore that call.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON—A senior Pentagon official clashed with the White House over its decision to freeze security aid to Ukraine, repeatedly warning that the hold could complicate the administration's ability to distribute the money before a congressionally mandated deadline, according to unredacted emails obtained by an outside group.
Beginning in July, Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, sent officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget emails in which she raised concerns about the legality of the hold on nearly $400 million in aid. Though Pentagon officials' frustrations were previously known, the emails, earlier versions of which had been redacted by the Justice Department, offer a new level of detail about Ms. McCusker's concerns.
Ms. McCusker's most dire predictions didn't come true—at one point she warned that $120 million or more of the aid was at risk of not being spent. But after the White House lifted its hold on Sept. 11, more than $35 million in aid didn't make it to Ukraine by the time the fiscal year ended at the end of that month.
The decision to freeze the aid to Ukraine was at the center of the House's investigation of President Trump, which resulted in his impeachment last month . The Senate is now expected to hold a trial, and Democrats are pushing for testimony from administration officials in an effort to determine whether the decision to pause the aid was directly connected to Mr. Trump's desire for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations that could benefit the president. Mr. Trump has said he didn't make the aid contingent on the investigations.

A heavily redacted version of some documents related to the aid was obtained and released last month by the Center for Public Integrity through a public information request. Just Security, a group that publishes national security research and journalism, reviewed and published portions of the unredacted emails on Thursday. An administration official confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that the emails are authentic.
The Defense Department didn't respond to requests for comment.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) called the emails "a devastating blow to Senator McConnell's push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we've requested."
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) referred to comments the lawmaker made on the Senate floor last month. He said at the time that he wanted to put off any contentious resolutions—such as those calling witnesses—until a later phase of the trial.
The new emails reflect deep tension between Ms. McCusker and OMB. The relationship between Ms. McCusker and OMB slowly deteriorated, as senior officials at the office grew skeptical of her estimates of how much money was at risk of not being spent, according to people familiar with their interactions.
In response to the emails, OMB countered that Ms. McCusker's frustrations didn't reflect what they were hearing from other Pentagon officials.
"There was agreement every step of the way between DOD and OMB lawyers, who were responsible for working out the details of the hold, in line with the President's priorities," OMB spokeswoman Rachel Semmel said in a statement.
In her emails to OMB, Ms. McCusker raised concerns that the White House was violating the Impoundment Control Act, which requires that the executive branch spend money that has been appropriated by Congress.
After the administration imposed its hold on the aid in July and later extended it, Ms. McCusker objected to language included in a budget document by OMB that said the pause wouldn't prevent the Defense Department from spending the money.
"We hope it won't and will do all we can to execute once the policy decision is made, but can no longer make that declarative statement," she wrote in an Aug. 6 email to OMB officials.
Ms. McCusker also disagreed with talking points distributed by OMB after Politico first reported in late August that the aid had been put on hold. "No action has been taken by OMB that would preclude the obligation of these funds before the end of the fiscal year," the talking points said. The talking points asserted that the hold didn't preclude the money from being spent before the end of the fiscal year
In response, Ms. McCusker wrote that the talking point about the aid was "not accurate from a financial execution standpoint, something we have been consistently conveying for a few weeks." A senior administration official said lawyers in the Pentagon's Office of the General Counsel reviewed, edited and signed off on the talking points, an assertion supported by a document reviewed by the Journal.
Ms. McCusker's frustrations escalated in early September. After she warned OMB that $120 million might not be able to be spent by the end of the fiscal year because of the hold, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at OMB, responded with a letter that put the blame on the Defense Department for not doing enough to prepare to spend the funds if they were released.
Ms. McCusker replied, in an exchange first reported by the New York Times, "You can't be serious. I am speechless."

Texto completo: Some of us need a new year to resolve to become a better, more enlightened person.
Dan Harris needed a panic attack on live television.
Harris, an ABC news anchor, was doing an update on “Good Morning America" in 2004 when he, as he puts it, freaked out in front of 5 million people.
His heart was beating as if it would burst through his chest. He had trouble breathing.
“It felt like the world was ending," he said.
Harris grew up in Newton. His mother was a pathologist at Mass. General. His father was the chief of radiation oncology at the Brigham. Harris's first stop was a doctor, who concluded the panic attack was the result of his using cocaine and ecstasy, sporadic self-medication that began after spending several years covering war in the Middle East.
He had a disturbing realization. He liked the adrenaline rush he got from war reporting. He was using drugs to re-create it.
“I knew I had to change things," he said.
By coincidence, Peter Jennings, his boss and mentor at ABC, put him on the faith and spirituality beat. Just by doing his job, he got interested in meditation.
A lifelong agnostic, he brought along a healthy sense of skepticism, wary of the gurus in flowing robes and New Age sloganeering.
One of his ABC colleagues, Felicia Biberica, recommended a book by Eckhart Tolle, a German-born spiritual author. At first, Harris dismissed it as hippy codswallop. But Tolle triggered something, if only the realization that we all have a voice in our head, a voice that often tells us to do the things we regret.
Harris interviewed Tolle, finding him “correct, but not useful. He tells us how our minds work, but not what we can do about it."
Harris's wife, a physician, responded to that complaint by giving him a book by Mark Epstein, a psychiatrist who writes about the overlap of psychology and Buddhism.
“The Buddha had something you can do: meditation," Harris said. “I had two thoughts: I should start doing this, and it's a good story."
Harris read a lot. The books helped, but they also left him thinking he could make all the flowery language and emerging science more accessible, less intimidating to a much wider audience.
“I spent five years writing a book," he said.
He got the title for it when another colleague, Chris Sebastian, expressed astonishment that he went on a meditation retreat in Barre, in central Massachusetts.
“It makes me 10 percent happier," Harris told her.
Harris's 2014 book, “10% Happier," was a New York Times bestseller. He resisted a publisher's suggestion to up the percentage in the title.
“There are no silver bullets," he said, meaning you have to do the work, which for him was meditating up to two hours a day. Joseph Goldstein, the teacher who had the biggest impact on Harris, still lives at the Buddhist center in Barre.
Harris acknowledges that as a natural skeptic, he is the most unlikely meditation evangelist. But the science, and even his wife, tells him meditation can make him happier and, as he likes to put it, less of a jerk. He's wary of calling himself a Buddhist.
“I don't view Buddhism as a religion," he said. “There's an expression I like: It's not something to believe in, it's something to do."
He created a free “Ten Percent Happier" podcast with ABC, which produced its 220th episode this week, and a paid subscription app that he runs himself with a staff that works out of a nondescript office in downtown Boston.
“I wonder, would I keep going on retreats and practice and read if it wasn't my job?" he says. “My sense is I would. It's something I'm deeply drawn to. It's useful that I get paid to do this. But at the end of the day, I'm a storyteller and this is constantly fueling the content."

Diluting science is bad for Florida

Texto completo: A Times editorial

Clean water and air, reliable weather forecasts and an environment healthy enough to promote business dont come together by accident. They all depend on science playing a key part in public policymaking. But as the New York Times chronicled this week, the Trump administration has diminished the role of science in federal decision-making. Its a loss to the nation across the board  in public health, safety and economic growth  and especially risky to a populated, coastal state like Florida where science should serve as a robust first line of defense.

Trumps disdain for science may have been best epitomized by his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, a global accord aimed at reducing the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. But the administration has taken a range of other actions to limit the role science plays in the policymaking process, to marginalize the influence of researchers and to reduce the governments technical capacity by chasing away an experienced workforce.

As the Times reported, the administration pared back environmental oversight in response to complaints from energy producers, manufacturers and other industry giants who said the regulations hurt their businesses. The White House ordered federal agencies to cut the number of advisory boards that provide scientific input to the government. The goal was to give the administration greater discretion in easing regulations under the guise of eliminating wasteful government spending. While political appointees in previous administrations have overruled career employees, experts said the Trump administration has expanded that practice, with many top government positions occupied by former lobbyists who represented the very industries they now oversee. And the message hasnt been lost on career personnel; hundreds of federal scientists are departing, and at the Environmental Protection Agency, staffing has fallen to its lowest levels in at least a decade, the Times reports. That loss of expertise and institutional history combined with hiring freezes can set back research for years, if not decades.

The reductions in programs and personnel have led to the loss, delay or disruption of a broad range of scientific studies, covering topics from dairy farming and pesticide use to habitat loss, wildfire management and the economic impacts of natural disasters. This year, the EPA ended its funding for a joint project that sponsored 13 childrens health centers nationwide, which have explored how the complex interplay of genetics, environmental pollution and other factors have affected childrens health from preconception to young adulthood.

This downgrading of science is especially threatening to Florida, given its size, its large elderly population, the fragile coastal environment, its agricultural and tourist economies and the vulnerability of millions to major storms and hurricanes. The state learned the hard way the value of science after the 2010 BP oil spill, and again this past decade with the toxic algae blooms that erupted along both coasts. Short-changing science has costs, and Floridas political leaders should be unwavering in making that case in Washington, D.C.

Texto completo: Simon Gottwalt opts for salad and lasagna. It’s the strategic choice of a seasoned host who likes to focus on his guest once they cross the door, and of a parent keen to keep it simple.
“We always have a lot of people around,” says Mr. Gottwalt, a German living in Switzerland, before popping his signature dish into the oven. “It is rare that it is just us.”
What to cook can be a stressful decision when hosting, more so if the guest comes from a country with different culinary traditions. This is the second time that Mr. Gottwalt and his partner, Julia Buhmann, are welcoming a refugee into their Zurich flat, which they share with another couple who just had a baby. They all found the first time relatively positive, although it was a struggle to keep the conversation going and connect with the military experiences of their Afghan guest.
This September evening, the conversation flows. It transitions smoothly from somber moments – such as discussing the 17 months Filmon Heileab spent detained for illegal entry and separated from his own young family – to lighter ones. “It is because of prison that I got strong,” shares Mr. Heileab, an Eritrean who tried to cross from Italy to Switzerland three times before gaining refugee status.
Alternating between basic English and German, Mr. Heileab shows off family pictures and a video of the gravity-defying, laughter-inducing climbing skills of his toddler. He has two daughters, and their antics set the stage for common ground. His dinner hosts are parents to a toddler who was in bed by dinner and an alert baby who relished a new set of arms and smiles.
“Children make things easier,” reflects Mr. Gottwalt after the dinner. “They help create a connection.”
Mr. Heileab also left feeling positive. “The energy was good,” he says. “I like the opportunity to learn about what is happening in Switzerland.”
Such encounters are the fruit of the thoughtful matchmaking efforts of Gemeinsam Znacht – Dinner Together – a Zurich-based nonprofit founded in 2014. Its work was inspired by a similar initiative led by Ebba Akerman in Sweden. 
“I thought we have to do something in Switzerland, in the middle of Europe,” says Martina Schmitz, who recalls reading a New York Times feature about Ms. Akerman. Ms. Schmitz felt it crucial to take action in the face of the highest levels of displacement since World War II and launched Gemeinsam Znacht with the help of volunteers. 
An unprecedented 70 million people have been forced from their homes globally. In the face of this challenge, communities all over the world are turning to dinner projects, convinced that one of the best ways of breaking down barriers is the tried and true tradition of breaking bread. The range of hosts includes individuals, groups of friends, and even businesses. 
Trust at the table In Zurich, one of the more multicultural cities of Switzerland, the number of applications from wannabe hosts boomed in 2015 when media focused on the thousands of refugees trudging along the Balkan route and those drowning at sea – including the Syrian Kurdish child, Alan Kurdi, who struck a nerve far and wide.
“We had this spike of applications but we did not have enough refugees,” recalls Anna Stünzi, a member of Gemeinsam Znacht’s board. The women and children who dominated media images rarely ended up in Switzerland. And those who did typically arrived via neighboring Italy from Libya rather than through the Balkan route.
Now, she says, the host-to-guest ratio is more or less even, although host interest can dip after events such as the 2016 Germany attacks, some of which were carried out by refugees. Sometimes hosts want to be reassured and ask if the organization does background checks. They don’t. Others question whether checks should be done for hosts. It took considerable effort and multiple visits to asylum centers to establish trust with potential guests.
“We had to convince them that this project is neither governed by the government, nor is it the police, nor is it any lawyer or something that would trick them,” adds Ms. Stünzi. “But also that it is not something where they would simply be looked at. ... That it was really about getting to know each other.”
One challenge is the language barrier. This made it difficult to coordinate dinners and ensure that guest reached their destination – although as time passed refugees acquired the local language, German. Hosts are instructed to follow up their invitation phone call with a message clearly stating the time and place of the dinner. Ms. Schmitz, who has overseen the coordination of more than 1,000 dinner events in the span of five years, is adamant that the first contact should be done over the phone.
“You can’t just send a WhatsApp message and say ‘Come to my place,’” she says. “It is a question of decency.”
‘Life changing’ The website features an FAQ section. The most common question from potential hosts is what to cook. Meals that are heavy on cheese – a major staple of the Swiss diet – are discouraged as guests might be lactose-intolerant. While a no-pork diet is safe to assume for a Muslim guest, hosts are also reminded of the multiple fasts followed by Christian Eritreans of the Orthodox Church.
Some hosts worry about wealth disparity and ask whether they should hide some of their belongings. Others have reservations over hosting single men. While the nonprofit screens both hosts and guests to ensure a match, it is not an à la carte process. About 80% of the potential guests are young men between 16 and 25, mainly from Afghanistan and Eritrea, reflecting refugee and asylum-seeker figures in Switzerland.
“I’ll always tell the mother of a family to take a young man as a guest because they come from big families. They have no distance to children. They’re not afraid of children. They accept them,” she says. “And 99.9% that is true.”
In a country where the nuclear family is small and the extended family rarely part of the picture, many Swiss hosts report being pleasantly surprised by guests who were delighted to play with their children and hold their babies while cooking was underway.
“If they do it, they open up to a completely different level of acceptance,” she adds. “All these young men you see in train stations, in trams, and suddenly you know one of them and you know he’s a nice guy. It’s a life-changing experience.”

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- A barometer, said a wit, is an ingenious instrument that reveals the weather we are experiencing. Presidential campaigns often are political barometers. They can, however, change the social climate. The Democratic presidential aspirants, plucking at the electorate's sleeve, are perhaps inadvertently getting the country interested in moderation.
Many of them spent 2019 detailing how they would wield government as a scalpel to surgically remove America's blemishes. Inconveniently, but without inhibiting these aspirants, the year ended with a cascade of discouraging headlines about the scalpel: "At war with the truth: How officials put their spin on 18 years of [Afghanistan] setbacks" (Washington Post), "Inspector Accuses FBI Of 'Gross Incompetence' in Handling Wiretap" (New York Times), "FAA Knew Boeing's 737 Max Was Risky But Allowed Flights" (Wall Street Journal). Etc.
As 2020 begins, voters who say that their overriding objective is to remove the current president should wonder: Is it wise to hitch their wagons to any candidate whose agenda radiates, and requires, extravagant confidence in government's ability to radically rearrange America's most complex processes, from the allocation of economic resources to the provision of health care?
There is discouraging news for Donald Trump, which means encouraging news for the republic: Sen. Bernie Sanders is showing remarkable resilience, coronary and political, after his October "myocardial infarction." This is encouraging not because the nation should swap one form of economic illiteracy for another, replacing a florid, angry protectionist with a florid, angry socialist. Rather, it is encouraging because Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren continue to divide, more or less evenly, the "let's give government lots more to do" constituency. The longer this balance persists, the more time normal -- meaning not very agitated or attentive -- voters have to rally 'round candidates who do not make prudent people wince.
Mayor Pete Buttigieg, whose rise has been this political season's most interesting development, might have the political magic of allowing different voters to see different things in him. This recalls Hamlet having fun with Polonius:
Hamlet: Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
Polonius: ... 'tis like a camel, indeed.
Hamlet: Methinks it is like a weasel.
Polonius: It is backed like a weasel.
Hamlet: Or like a whale?
Polonius: Very like a whale.
The Democrats' nominee might be apparent late in the evening of March 3, "Super Tuesday," when 14 states allocate about 34% of the delegates to the nominating convention. By that evening, Michael Bloomberg will have learned, to his delight or sorrow, whether political spending is as potent as campaign reform scolds believe, or whether there is a steeply declining utility of the last millions of political spending.
If the nominee will be known that evening, we are already in at least the seventh inning of the nomination game. But the top of the first inning can matter a lot.
In early December 2011, polls indicated that former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, then seeking the Republican presidential nomination, was at 3% in polls anticipating the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses. Granted, the vagaries of Iowa's caucuses -- typically long evening gatherings during a Midwest winter -- make predictive polling difficult. Still, Santorum's support was negligible four weeks before he won with 24.6%. His wafer-thin victory was not confirmed until Jan. 20. If he rather than Mitt Romney had been announced the winner on caucus night, the subsequent competition might have developed differently.
So, it is still possible that someone -- Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, someone -- might yet surge. Remember, as a song in "The Music Man," which is set in Iowa, says, Iowans can be "contrary." They might want to play "cheat the prophet," as G.K. Chesterton described this game in "The Napoleon of Notting Hill": People listen respectfully as experts explain the inevitable, then mischievously cause something else to happen.
Fortunately for those who seek entertaining surprises from politics, political science is a science of single instances, which means it is not much of a science. And fortunately for those who think today's political fare is too highly seasoned, perhaps there is a market for something milder.
In Peter De Vries' novel "I Hear America Swinging," about the sexual revolution arriving in Iowa, the protagonist is invited to an orgy where he is nicknamed "Vanilla" because of his adherence to the sexually mundane. Perhaps in this year's politics, as in ice cream year after year, the most popular flavor will be vanilla.

2020 Impeachment 101

Texto completo: As 2020 dawns, the wisdom of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's strategic withholding articles of impeachment from the Senate becomes clearer. The subsequent delay has accomplished three things, making it harder for Senate Republicans to meekly agree to a sham trial.
First, it's allowed more incriminating information to come to light. A devastating and detailed New York Times report chronicles President Trump's three-month obsession with blocking Ukraine military aid to extort an announcement of an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-national security adviser John Bolton together approached Trump in an effort to get the aid released. Trump refused. He subsequently blocked the latter two from testifying in the impeachment inquiry - as well as chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and OMB staff Michael Duffy, key aides in pushing the plot.
Second, the delay has forced at least two Republican senators, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and Maine's Susan Collins, to share their public discomfort with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's forcing and prejudging a witness-free trial. Other Republicans may have similar spasms of conscience; has anyone seen Mitt Romney or Ben Sasse?
Third, it's revealed how much being impeached has rattled Trump: Trump's Twitter rants have soared, spewing insults at Pelosi and even outing the alleged whistleblower - another arguably impeachable offense.
Simultaneously, public support for Trump's impeachment and removal have hit new highs.
No, there aren't enough Republican votes to convict and remove Trump. But a true trial can nonetheless produce something vital: shining the light of truth in the president's eyes.

Texto completo: The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. , announced Thursday that it raised $34. 5 million in the final quarter of 2019 in Sanders' bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The total is the largest raised so far in a single quarter by a Democratic presidential candidate.
In a press release, Sanders' campaign emphasized the large number of donations – 1. 8 million donations – as representative of the campaign's grassroots support.
According to a video the Sanders campaign posted Wednesday on Twitter, more than 1. 2 million people donated to the campaign.
"Bernie Sanders is closing the year with the most donations of any candidate in history at this point in a presidential campaign," Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said.
According to the Sanders campaign, "teacher" was the most common occupation of donors, and the most common employers of donors were Amazon, Starbucks, Walmart, the U. S. Postal Service and Target.
The average donation was $18. 53, the campaign said.

Former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign announced Wednesday that it raised $24. 7 million in the past quarter, bringing its yearly total to more than $76 million.
Other Democratic presidential candidates also released their fundraising totals as the new year began.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang's campaign raised $16. 5 million, a $6. 5 million increase from the previous quarter.

Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign said later Thursday it raised $22. 7 million in the last three months of 2019, which the campaign called its best fundraising quarter yet. The campaign said the average online contribution was $23 and the average overall contribution was $41,
Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign has yet to release its fundraising totals but told supporters in an email last week it raised $17 million so far in the quarter.
President Donald Trump's reelection campaign announced Thursday that it raised $46 million over the past quarter, with $102. 7 million cash on hand as the president prepares to enter the general election.
Voting in the Iowa caucuses begins on Feb. 3.

Let's look upon 2020 with thoughtful consideration

Texto completo: Around this time each year, I typically reiterate that I've never been real big on New Year's resolutions. And then I set about making some — or at least some sort of non-binding, loose facsimile of a resolution to which I most surely will attempt to adhere for at least three or four weeks.
In other words, a New Year's resolution. But, like every other year, this year is different.
I'm not typically so pessimistic, but I have a sneaking suspicion that 2020 will be, by nearly all metrics, exponentially worse than 2019. The politics will ramp up, impeachment will unfold, and divisiveness will reach a fever pitch. There will be caucuses and straw polls and Super Tuesday and party conventions and debate after debate after debate. If recent history is any indicator, 2020 will likely bring dozens of mass shootings, along with the unavoidable natural disasters and manmade crises.
So, on that cheerful note, I'm preparing myself to step into what I fear will be a very tumultuous year with the understanding that much will be beyond my control. One year ago, I decided to get better-organized — and I feel like I succeeded. In 2020, I feel like I need to turn that focus inward and work on myself.
Which is to say that I need to spend more time bringing order to the things within my control.
I recently discovered a Fast Company article about seven podcasts to help you achieve your 2020 goals. And, after giving a few of them a cursory listen, I've decided I need to try to work them into my listening habits. While I'm typically a little resistant to anything self-helpy or woo-woo, I also realize that I need to get back to the mindfulness and meditation that I gave up five years ago.
Fast Company recommended, among others, "How to Be a Better Person with Kate Hanley," NPR's "Hidden Brain" podcast, "The Accidental Creative" with Todd Henry, and ABC's "Ten Percent Happier with Dan Harris." I found the latter to be particularly poignant.
Fifteen years ago, Harris was an anchor on Good Morning America when he had an on-air panic attack, a full-blown meltdown. He later called it his "on-air Waterloo." Harris then turned his attention to the causes for his anxiety and wrote a #1 New York Times Bestseller, "10% Happier: How I Tamed the Voice in My Head, Reduced Stress Without Losing My Edge, and Found Self-Help That Actually Works — A True Story."
While I've seldom admitted it, I too am susceptible to the same kind of anxiety and panic attacks that Harris suffered on live TV that morning. As a reporter, I've stood in crowds, paralyzed with fear (or something similar) of approaching a stranger — even for a benign comment about why they enjoy coming to the annual Renaissance Faire in Young Park or the Las Cruces Arts Fair at the Convention Center.
I know that this can be overcome, and 2020 is the year to quiet the voices in my head and tackle my fears. But this will involve examining them and getting to the root of those fears. As a self-admitted introvert, I know that the solution is — to some degree — performative. You have to "fake it 'til you make it." I've done it before.
But I'm hoping that, with some careful thought and attention, 2020 will be the year that I am able to take control of that which has held me back — and I can become ten percent happier.
Jeez. That sounds like a resolution, if ever there was one.

Word for 2020: Resilience

Texto completo: Our View

After all, we have so much waterfront at stake.

If Jacksonville were to build seawalls everywhere, it would cost billions. That won't be practical. But all of the options need to be addressed.

So kudos to City Council President Scott Wilson for establishing a special committee on resilience and for Councilman Matt Carlucci for proposing it.

Carlucci lives in San Marco, which is used to flooding. But it has become worse in recent years.

The committee needs to look at past, present and future challenges.

For the past, we need to understand the baseline? Is flooding getting more frequent and more extensive? In many cases, it is.

For the present, what can be done immediately that can have an impact?

For the future, what should be done about development along the waterways? When is it more economical to spend money on infrastructure like protecting sewage treatment plants in flood zones? Or when it is more economical to retreat?

Downtown developments along the St. Johns River need to be protected from the impact of rising seas and storm surge.

The storm surge from Hurricane Irma literally shut down buildings for months.

Warmer seas have meant that hurricanes have become more intense and have dumped record amounts of rainfall as well.

The Northeast Florida Regional Council has been quietly studying these issues for years, taking a businesslike, risk-management approach that fits the culture here.

City planners have also been studying the issue, for instance evaluating whether current flood area maps have become outdated,

These are issues that will remain for generations. It's about time that City Hall began addressing them.

Businesses see risks

It was only a time before the financial industry began to seriously take note of the dangers of flooding in a warmer world.

According to a story from Bloomberg News, "During the preparations for Jacksonville's sale of $197 million in bonds in August, a disclosure counsel asked if the city had long-term plans to implement projects that increased resilience against storm-related risks.

"Questions like that are new, said Randall Barnes, the city's treasurer."

According to the Reuters News Sservice, "Investors, analysts, research firms and companies are putting more emphasis on how climate issues ranging from rising sea levels to record heat waves will affect profits and revenues in the United States and what companies are doing to address those risks."

In 2019 alone, there have been 10 weather and climate disaster events that caused more than $1 billion in damages.

Wildfires and hail, once considered secondary risks, have accounted for $13 billion of $15 billion in natural disaster claims through August.

And 30-year mortgages may become unattainable due to climate risks, reported the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Financial markets hate uncertainty, and the huge losses taken recently are likely to make funders cautious.

In California, for instance, 50,000 homeowners can't obtain property or casualty insurance because of risks to their homes.

Banks are shifting risky mortgages along the coasts to the federal government, meaning taxpayers support people building on floodplains, reported The New York Times.

Losses from flooding could be worse than the subprime crisis because many of these home values won't come back.

"It is less likely that borrowers will continue to make mortgage payments if their homes literally are under water," said the chief economist at the federal agency Freddie Mac.

But this is not just a coastal issue. Extreme climate events like heat waves, heavy rain, drought and wildfires can happen anywhere.

Florida, however, is especially vulnerable to the impacts, which is why our elected leaders need to be aggressively preparing now.

A dollar spent on resilience will go a long way to prevent many more dollars on restoration.

Just look at what Hurricane Michael did to the Panhandle of Florida.

It came strong and fast, and the devastation is still apparent.

Texto completo: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway's inbox makes abundantly clear how personally venomous local politics has become.
" 'Fat,' 'sick,' 'worthless,' 'gutless,' 'loser,' " she said, reciting some of the insults that have been leveled at her since becoming mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, in April.
She got a taste of the animosity during her campaign, when she was criticized on blogs and social media not for her plans for housing, stormwater management or transportation, but for not wearing makeup.
"People are angry, or afraid, and express themselves in mean ways," she said.
Rhodes-Conway is not alone in facing this type of abuse. As many as 79% of mayors in the United States report being the victim of harassment, threats or other psychological abuse, according to a recent study. Thirteen percent also reported instances of physical violence.
And one factor -- gender -- stood out above all others as a predictor of whether a mayor would be targeted. Using a statistical analysis that took into account factors like time in office, the researchers concluded that female mayors were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to experience psychological abuse and almost three times as likely to experience physical violence.
The study, published in the academic journal State and Local Government Review, and interviews with current and former mayors, lay bare today's harsh political climate, in which threats of violence over social media are constant and speaking out can be perceived as a political weakness.
"We're seeing more women get elected into political office everywhere at the same time that there are increasing threats against all public officials," said Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. "Men also face violence, but women face more and more types of violence."
And the ease of making threats on social media is driving the abuse, said Sue Thomas of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, lead author of the paper.
"Social media is absolutely toxic to women politicians. It's much more virulent to me as a woman than as an out lesbian," said Annise Parker, who was mayor of Houston for three two-year terms. "Remarks about the way I look, what I weigh or how I dress -- aspects of femininity -- escalate into threats of physical violence."
And when Karen Weaver made history in Flint, Michigan, by becoming its first female mayor -- amid a burgeoning water crisis in 2015 -- she believed that she would have more support to discuss the issues facing the city, she said.
On social media, she said, "They went after me like I wasn't a person and had no feelings or family."
In all, 16% of the 238 mayors who responded to the survey said their experiences of abuse had them thinking about leaving their office, suggesting that the toxic environment also threatens to scare off mayors who are interested in long careers and higher political office.
"Folks who have everything it takes to succeed, win an election and be a terrific public servant, that's why they say no," said Christopher Cabaldon, mayor of West Sacramento, California, since 1998. He added that on social media it's "open season on politicians and their families. It definitely warps what our local democracy looks like."
He said that he had been able to remain in office for more than two decades, in part, because he is single and has not faced the discomfort of having a spouse or relative attacked.
"People don't know it until they experience it," said Parker, who is now the chief executive of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which helps train candidates for office. "It doesn't keep people out, but it burns people out once they're in it."
For Heather McTeer Toney, the first woman and the youngest person, at 28, to serve as mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, the menace arrived in her mailbox, not her inbox.
The words were written on a yellow sheet of paper, torn off from a legal pad, in black, blue and red ink, and the ones that explicitly threatened rape were written in red. It was more disturbing in a way, she said, that someone took the time to write a letter and mail it.
"It's 15 years later, and I can still remember that," said McTeer Toney, who was also the first black person in the post. "Trust me, this is something that I want to forget."
Mark Barbee, 29, a restaurant server who leads Bridgeport, Pennsylvania, a city of 5,000 about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, said he received death threats after winning election in 2017. City Council meetings have been especially contentious. His proposal for an anti-discrimination policy only increased the ire directed at him.
Barbee, a gay African American, said that the difficult times -- during which some supporters told him his advocacy was "not worth your life" -- forced him to contemplate leaving office.
The survey also found that mayors who are younger, in strong chief executive systems and in larger cities were more likely to be affected by violence and abuse.
And then there is the political calculation that comes with speaking out about the abuse: Will the public be sympathetic to a mayor who is complaining?
"Politicians have an image to keep up," Krook said. "That's particularly hard for women. If you potentially show some weakness, people can really jump on that."
Many mayors seemed to have reluctantly accepted the abuse as part of serving in office but have come up with their own methods of coping.
Rhodes-Conway does not engage with the attacks that come over social media, but her office reads everything, she said. "If I were reading this every day, it would be just awful," she said. "I feel for mayors who have less of a staff or less of a filter. This is really painful."
Instead, she combats the barrage of nastiness by visiting coffee shops around the city, where she and her staff buy drinks for residents, many of whom arrive upset and talk for an hour. "Even when people disagree with me face to face, they are polite," she said.
Mayor Lovely Warren of Rochester, New York, said she went so far as to shut down her personal Facebook account for nearly three years.
"When you get into a fight with the pig, you get dirty, and the pig likes it," she said, paraphrasing advice given by her family.

Texto completo: In an internal memo, Pentagon leadership has urged military personnel not to take mail-in DNA tests, warning that they create security risks, are unreliable and could negatively affect service members' careers.
The letter, which was reported by Yahoo News, was sent last week. It does not name any particular DNA testing companies, but counsels broadly against buying ancestry and health tests promoted with military discounts and other military incentives.
Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the memo had been sent.
"We want to ensure all service members are aware of the risks of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing," he told The New York Times over email.
Over the past decade, millions of Americans have purchased DNA tests through companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry with the hopes of connecting with relatives, finding out more about their family origins and learning about how their DNA could affect their chances of developing certain health conditions.
Robertson said that the tests might provide inaccurate results and have negative professional consequences. "The unintentional discovery of markers that may affect readiness could affect a service member's career," he said.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act -- known as GINA -- prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes. It does not apply to members of the military, however.
The memo was written by Joseph Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and James Stewart, the assistant secretary of defense for manpower. They warn that the tests "could expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences."
In a statement, a spokeswoman from 23andMe said that the company took great care to protect customers' privacy. An Ancestry spokeswoman said that the company had not targeted military personnel with discounts.

Iraqis storm our embassy, another sign of US failure

Texto completo: It's a matter of official record that Afghanistan has been the longest war in American history, still going on after more than 18 years. But you could make a case that the longest war is really Iraq. We initiated hostilities there in January 1991, and they've never really stopped.
You know something has gone wrong when a mob of the people you thought you were helping storms your embassy chanting "Death to America." It brings back memories from 2003, when Dick Cheney informed Americans that our invading troops would be "greeted as liberators." Yet the objects those Iraqis were hurling at the diplomatic compound were not flowers.
The protest came in response to U.S. airstrikes against sites in Iraq and Syria, which were directed at an Iranian-supported militia that killed an American contractor in a rocket barrage. Iran's proxy forces have made several attacks on U.S. military facilities in recent weeks, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. "will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy."
Why Americans are still in Iraq to be put in jeopardy is a long story. Why Iranian-backed insurgents want to kill them is another complicated tale. But the latest events are a reminder that when it comes to Iraq, we still don't have a clue.
Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg have raised the issue because Joe Biden makes much of his foreign policy expertise. But as a senator, he voted for the invasion. Sanders voted against it, and Buttigieg thinks it relevant that Biden "supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime."
Mayor Pete is too kind. The Iraq War was the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in anyone's lifetime. Over time, our leaders have made it even worse. And its effects have billowed like a toxic cloud over the national landscape, where they will foul our politics for years to come.
The 2003 war followed 12 years in which we enforced no-fly areas in Iraq, sometimes bombing targets and killing Iraqi civilians. That approach failed at one of its objectives: toppling dictator Saddam Hussein. Our leaders' frustration at his survival served as motivation for the invasion, which was sold on deception and misinformation.
The invasion was a case of "catastrophic success." We accomplished one mission only to be surprised and overwhelmed by the forces it uncorked. George W. Bush's administration claimed the victory would be easy, cheap and quick. It turned out to be insurmountable, astronomically expensive, long-lasting and not exactly a victory.
By smashing Saddam's regime, we eliminated one enemy but helped another. It's been said that the U.S. and Iraq fought a war, and Iran won. The mullahs became a dominant factor in the aftermath, thanks to their close relations with numerous groups that had opposed Saddam.
As The New York Times reported in 2017, "Iran never lost sight of its mission: to dominate its neighbor so thoroughly that Iraq could never again endanger it militarily, and to use the country to effectively control a corridor from Tehran to the Mediterranean."
The U.S. occupation pushed the two regimes into a close alliance. In the country we set out to liberate, our forces now face attacks from militias that Iran supports.
We left in 2011, because the Iranian-allied Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki refused to sign an agreement protecting American troops from prosecution in Iraqi courts. The space we vacated was filled by militants known as the Islamic State. In 2014, we returned to fight this new enemy in tacit cooperation with ... Iran.
The bewilderment and regret the war fostered back home served to discredit leaders in both parties, as well as the premises of U.S. foreign policy. They fostered a widespread cynicism that sunk Hillary Clinton -- who had supported the invasion -- and boosted someone whose chief foreign policy credential was having nothing to do with such failures.
When respected experts were so wrong about something so important, the public might well wonder if maybe Donald Trump's stupendous ignorance could really be worse.
But it's not clear he learned the lesson that military might does not solve all problems. It would surprise no one if he lurched into a war with Iran or North Korea -- or expanded the one in Iraq.
This much is true: The Iraq War was the worst U.S. foreign policy decision of Mayor Pete's lifetime. At least so far.

Texto completo: TALIWANG, Indonesia - The wildcat miner had something to prove: processing gold ore with liquid mercury was perfectly safe. So he drank some of the toxic chemical, choosing the promises of gold fever over the pain of mercury poisoning.
"I have no worry about mercury," bragged the fast-talking Syarafuddin Iskandar, 58. "I drank it. We gave it to the cows and the buffaloes. They drank it. Nothing happened. There's no problem."
His stunt has made him famous in the gold fields of Sumbawa, an Indonesian island 100 miles east of Bali where makeshift mining camps dot the jungle hills. But it also illustrated the stark choice the illegal miners here face. To earn a living they effectively poison themselves, their communities and the environment by using mercury, an outlawed but popular way to extract gold from ore.
For decades, Syarafuddin and thousands of small-scale miners like him have worked illegally in West Sumbawa on land the government leases to large mining companies. The outlaw miners pay nothing for rights to the land but reap as much as $6 million a month in gold.
About 1 million small-scale gold miners operate across Indonesia, the world's largest island nation, and the outlaw industry presents a vexing paradox.
The use of mercury in the wildcat camps results in devastating effects on health and the environment. The heavy metal is well known as a slow-acting poison that seeps into the food chain, causing birth defects, neurological disorders and death. But because the mines are a short-term boon to the economy - employing people who might otherwise live in crushing poverty - the government is reluctant to shut them down.
The competing interests of the local people, the government, environmentalists and large mining companies that control land where wildcat miners operate are now coming to a head in West Sumbawa. This time a large mining company is taking steps, which it says are meant to protect the environment.
Last year, officers from a feared Police Mobile Brigade Corps, armed with assault rifles, climbed through dense jungle to shut down the mountaintop camps of dozens of outlaw miners.
The miners had squatted there for years, using mercury that poisoned the soil and a nearby stream. The site was previously controlled by Newmont Goldcorp, an American company and one of the largest mining businesses in the world.
The police ordered the miners to dismantle their camps, cut up their equipment with a chain saw and block the mine entrances with debris. The wildcatters seethed as the miners were forced to destroy their operations.
"We are crushed that they are closing this mine because we have no other way to make a living," said one outlaw mine operator, Zaenal Abidin, who had employed two dozen men to work his claim.
The environmental group Nexus3 Foundation estimates that 850 gold mining sites have become mercury contaminated hot spots and that half a million people suffer from mercury poisoning nationwide.
The rare police crackdown was prompted by the mining company, PT Amman Mineral Nusa Tenggara.
Amman Mineral acquired the vast land concession and huge Batu Hijau open-pit copper mine from Newmont in 2016 during a push by the government to assert national control over mineral resources.
With a pipeline that dumped massive amounts of mine waste into the sea, Newmont gained a reputation for damaging the environment.
Closing the unauthorized mines is part of a campaign by Amman Mineral to stop illegal mining and uncontrolled mercury use on the former Newmont concession and another, known as Indotan, that it oversees 20 miles north.
"Initially, we thought of it as just illegal pillaging of resources," said Amman Mineral's director, Alexander Ramlie. "But when we looked deeper at it, we realized it is a more serious social problem. They are creating an environmental disaster."
The vast majority of West Sumbawa's 7,000 wildcat miners are on the Indotan site, which Amman Mineral's partners recently took over in a separate deal.
Much of the mining takes place in the hills above Lake Taliwang, a shallow lake northeast of Taliwang town.
A 2016 study found that so much of the miners' mercury reached the lake that eating just one lake fish could exceed a person's mercury allowance for a week. A second study that surveyed miners found that many had high mercury levels and some were experiencing early symptoms of mercury poisoning, such as finger tremors and sleep disturbances.
But in the absence of government warnings or enforcement of the ban on mercury use, it is easy for miners to dismiss the idea that it is hazardous.
Wildcat miners have been operating for decades on the Indotan concession, where they have established permanent communities and an industrial-scale village for processing ore. The miners operate openly without fear that the police will interfere. On one road, they have set up a checkpoint to control access to their diggings.
Some government, police and military officials also are said to profit from the illicit gold trade, which is estimated at $5 billion a year.
The miners will fight any attempt to drive them off the land without providing other jobs, said Anton, a Sumbawa native who owns mines and mills. Like many Indonesians, he uses one name.
Wearing flashy 22-carat necklaces made from gold his mine produced, he questions why big companies like Newmont and Amman Mineral get lucrative mining concessions while he and his fellow miners are branded as illegal.
"Why do you allow the outsiders to operate while we, the locals, are forbidden from doing the work?" he asked.
The mine bosses and their workers have good reason not to give ground. Miners in the Taliwang region reported making an average of 15 times more from gold mining than from other occupations, according to the survey of 55 miners.
Officials said the illegal operations are the second-largest contributor to the economy of West Sumbawa Regency, after Amman Mineral's legal operation.

2010S were a decade of disillusionment NATIONAL VIEWPOINT

Texto completo: Nothing much happened in America in the 2010s. The unemployment rate declined slowly but steadily; the stock market rose; people's economic situation gradually improved. There were no terrorist attacks on the scale of 9/11, no new land wars to rival Iraq and Vietnam. The country was relatively calm: Violent crime and illegal immigration trended downward, teenage delinquency diminished, teen birthrates fell and the out-of-wedlock birthrate stabilized.
In Washington, only two major pieces of legislation passed Congress, both of them predictable - a health insurance expansion under a Democratic president and a deficit-financed tax cut under a Republican. No enduring majorities were forged; control of government was divided for seven of the 10 years. There were few bipartisan deals, even as the policy fads that came and went - education reform, deficit hawkishness - left underlying realities more or less the same. Inertia and inaction were the order of the day.
If this doesn't sound like a complete description of the decade - well, it isn't. It's a provocation that leaves out a lot of important indicators (the opioid epidemic and the collapsing birthrate above all) that deliberately doesn't mention populism, the Great Awokening or Donald Trump, and that ignores the feeling of crisis, the paranoia and mistrust and hysteria that have pervaded our public life throughout the later 2010s.
But the provocation represents a truth that's important for interpreting all that paranoia and polarization and mistrust - because even if you believe that the mood of crisis, the feeling that the liberal order might be cracking up, is the defining feature of the departing decade, you still have to reckon with why that feeling has crested so powerfully in a period surprisingly short on world-altering events.
Consider, by way of contrast, the decade before this one. Between 2000 and 2009, the United States experienced the Florida recount and the dot-com bust, suffered the worst attack on our shores since Pearl Harbor, launched two major foreign invasions, attempted the transformation of the Middle East and failed, and entered the worst economic meltdown since the Great Depression. Meanwhile, disruption was everywhere: Newspapers perished, partisan cable networks ascended, the smartphone took over the world, and the Amazon-Google-Facebook internet consolidated into something like its current shape.
Compared to this litany, the 2010s look a little uneventful, don't they? Even if you declare Obamacare a big deal and grant Trump's election world-historical significance... even then, the last decade's disruptions don't quite measure up.
So why does the psychology of the 2010s, relative to the country's mental situation in the Bush or Clinton era, feel so disappointed, distrustful and deranged?
Let me suggest, as one possible answer, that we consider U.S. history since the end of the Cold War as a three-act play. The first act, the 1990s, was a period of hubris, when we half-believed that we were entering a new age of domestic dynamism and global power - that our leaders deserved trust again, that the emerging digital age would be a blessing and our military was ready to spread liberty's blessings round the world.
The 2000s, in turn, were an era of nemesis - when the most overstretched expressions of that '90s hubris, from the Pets.com version of the new economy to the Bush doctrine to the exurban housing boom, all met their grimly predestined fate.
But as the 2000s ended, the revenges of reality had not yet been properly interpreted. The failed administration of George W. Bush was there as a scapegoat, Barack Obama was there to play the savior, and first liberals and then some ideological conservatives insisted that in fact everything would have been fine if only Bush had taken their preferred policy course instead.
Bush was, indeed, an unsuccessful president, but this conceit was false, and the gradually unfolding revelation of its falseness made the 2010s an era of disillusionment, in which the knowledge we gained mattered more than the new events we experienced. The sense of crisis, alienation and betrayal emerged more from backward glances than new disasters, reflecting newly awakened - or awokened, if you prefer - readings of our recent history, our entire post-Cold War arc.
The election of Trump probably wasn't the moment of authoritarianism descending - but it was an important moment of exposure, which revealed things about race relations and class resentments and the rot in the Republican Party.
Meanwhile, in case after case the 2010s were a decade when cranks were proven right and the establishment wrong about developments from prior decades - about the wisdom of establishing Europe's common currency, about the scale and scope of sexual abuse in elite institutions.
In this sense the Jeffrey Epstein scandal was an appropriate capstone for the decade. Epstein's worst crimes belonged to the 1990s and the 2000s rather than the 2010s, but the full revelations only arrived now, in the age of disillusionment, adding to the retrospective shadow cast across the entire political and journalistic class.
The 2010s were filled with angst and paranoia, they pushed people toward radicalism and reaction, but they didn't generate much effective social and political activity beyond the populist middle finger and the progressive Twitter mob.
It is this peculiar cultural predicament - the combination of disillusionment with stability, radicalization with stalemate, discontent and derangement with sterility and apathy - that I keep calling decadence. Whether it will last another 10 years is an open question; a catastrophe or a renaissance might be just around the corner. But as we usher out the 2010s, this decade of distrustful stability and prosperous despair, it has no rival as the presiding spirit of our age.

Texto completo: Victoria Pedretti doesn't scare quite so easily anymore. At least, not since she's become TV's favorite new horror queen, a sort of "Jamie Lee Curtis, millennial edition."
Fans of the Netflix series "The Haunting of Hill House" know Pedretti from her breakout performance as the warm and sympathetic twin Nell Crain. She nabbed that role just seconds after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University in 2017, and her success has led to two more roles: She returns to that series for its second season (called "The Haunting of Bly Manor," an all-new spookfest out next year in which she plays a completely different character), and she stars in the second season of "You," another Netflix hit, playing the object of Penn Badgley's affection.
Pedretti, 24, who grew up near Philadelphia, also recently appeared as a murderous Manson hippie in Quentin Tarantino's "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood." She recently spoke by phone from Vancouver, on a break from shooting "Bly Manor."

Q: In the first season of "You," Penn Badgley plays Joe Goldberg, who falls for a young writer. In Season 2, he's drawn to your character, Love Quinn, an aspiring chef. He seems to really go for creative types.
A: He's definitely drawn to women who seem to have their own goals and ambitions - which is a good quality, I guess.

Q: Sure, aside from the pesky psychopath thing.
A: Right.

Q: How are your own skills in the kitchen? Are you much of a chef?
A: Definitely. I love to cook. I spent a lot of time in high school cooking instead of doing my homework.

Q: What's your go-to dish?
A: I think pasta tends to warm people's hearts, you know? I put a lot of love into making pasta. But I like to try new things, too.

Q: You're getting to be an old pro when it comes to horror stories and thrillers. Do you like to watch those kinds of tales?
A: Not really. Most of my life I've avoided that. I find life scary enough. I'm an actor. (She laughs.) I'm already really sensitive, I've gotta admit.

Q: I'm partial to classics, like "The Shining" and "Poltergeist." And I have a special place in my heart for "The Amityville Horror" because my grandparents actually lived in Amityville.
A: That's so cool. So much of my experience with horror growing up was with kids trying to get everybody to go to the basement to watch a movie to see who could handle it the most.

Q: Like a slasher pic?
A: Yeah. Those movies are all jump-scares. It's never been my cup of tea. But I'm figuring it out. I've begun to see how horror isn't so different from a lot of the things you experience in a regular drama. And I'm appreciating the fact that these horror stories we tell relate to the folklore with which we've explained the world for so long. Monsters and ghosts and ghouls - societies have always been wrestling with the idea of death and what it means to die. So I've been watching a lot of horror, actually, to see how it's constructed.

Q: What was it like working with "Gossip Girl" heartthrob Penn Badgley?
A: OH MY GOD! I miss him. He's the most lovely, creative, exuberant, intelligent man. He's really a great person to work with. A great collaborator and friend. I'm so excited for everybody to see the amazing work he's done this season.

Q: Did he sort of welcome you to "You?"
A: Honestly, he was kind of on his lonesome, being one of the only people left from the first season. We shot in an entirely different place with an entirely different crew. And almost the entire cast was different. I feel a lot like him now on this second season of "Haunting," being one of the only people from the first season. It's interesting to go into another season of a show with such a different vibe. There's a lot of readjusting to do.

Texto completo: In an internal memo, Pentagon leadership has urged military personnel not to take mail-in DNA tests, warning that they create security risks, are unreliable and could negatively affect service members' careers.
The letter, which was reported by Yahoo News, was sent last week. It does not name any particular DNA testing companies, but counsels broadly against buying ancestry and health tests promoted with military discounts and other military incentives.
Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the memo had been sent.
"We want to ensure all service members are aware of the risks of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing," he told The New York Times over email.
Over the past decade, millions of Americans have purchased DNA tests through companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry with the hopes of connecting with relatives, finding out more about their family origins and learning about how their DNA could affect their chances of developing certain health conditions.
Robertson said that the tests might provide inaccurate results and have negative professional consequences. "The unintentional discovery of markers that may affect readiness could affect a service member's career," he said.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act - known as GINA - prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes. It does not apply to members of the military, however.
The memo was written by Joseph Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and James Stewart, the assistant secretary of defense for manpower. They warn that the tests "could expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences."
In a statement, a spokeswoman from 23andMe said that the company took great care to protect customers' privacy. An Ancestry spokeswoman said that the company had not targeted military personnel with discounts.

Texto completo: Back in 2000, the American Bach Society and the Bach Choir of Bethlehem jointly launched the Young American Singer Competition. Every other year since then, up to 10 finalists chosen from around the country in a blind audition compete in front of a live audience at the annual Bethlehem Bach Festival. The 113th festival in May will again host the finals of the Young American Singer's Competition.
At the finals, each singer presents one recitative and two arias by J.S. Bach. The first prize winner chosen by a panel of distinguished judges receives a career development grant of $3,000 and a solo performing opportunity with the Bach Choir of Bethlehem in a future season. In addition to the first prize, up to three additional cash awards of $500 may be awarded to other finalists, at the judges' discretion.
Obviously, the stakes are high. But even more important than the monetary awards is the career boost the winners often receive. Past winners who have gone on to worldwide careers, including performances with the Bach Choir, include Sasha Cooke (2006), Dashon Burton (2012), Janna Critz (2014), Nola Richardson and Christopher Edwards (2016) and Gabriela Estephanie Solis (2018).
Certainly these singers all have a special interest in the music of J.S. Bach. But more often than not, their versatility goes far beyond the venerable repertoire of Bach, Handel, Brahms, and the like. For instance, consider mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, a two-time Grammy Award winner described by The New York Times as "a luminous standout" and by Opera News as "equal parts poise, radiance and elegant directness."
Cooke's frequent appearances with San Francisco Opera and worldwide orchestras, along with the multiple world premieres in which she has sung, are proof that you can defy the traditional canon. While her fellow students at Julliard wanted to sing Verdi and Rossini, Cooke gained a reputation as a quick study willing to learn new pieces written by her composer colleagues.
Her Met Opera debut came the year after she won the Young American Singer Competition, and in 2008, she was selected to sing Kitty in the Met's production of John Adams' "Doctor Atomic." Other roles she has created include Jan Arnold in Joby Talbot's 2015 "Everest" at Dallas Opera; Laurene in the 2017 Santa Fe premiere of "The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs," and, most recently, the heroine in the English National Opera's production of "Marnie."
Bass-baritone Dashon Burton, who won the Young American Singer Competition in 2012, has become one of the Bach Choir's most beloved guest soloists. Burton has established a vibrant career in opera, recital, and with the orchestra. Unlike Cooke, Burton's repertoire leans more toward the classics, with Bach's Passions and the B minor Mass, Mendelssohn's Elijah, Beethoven's 9th, the Brahms Requiem, Handel's Messiah, and Mozart's Requiem all key elements.
Yet Burton crosses musical borders too. An original member of the groundbreaking vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth, he won a Grammy for their recording of Caroline Shaw's Pulitzer-Prizewinning "Partita for 8 Voices." This season, he sang Michael Tilson Thomas' "Rilke Songs" with the Cleveland Orchestra, and the world premiere of Caroline Shaw's "The Listeners" (a part written by Shaw specifically for Burton), first with the Philharmonia Baroque and then with the North Carolina Symphony.
Interested in participating in the competition? The finals take place on May 17 at Peter Hall on the Moravian College campus in Bethlehem during the 113th Bethlehem Bach Festival. Judges will include Greg Funfgeld, artistic director and conductor of the Bach Choir, and other judges to be announced. The competition is open to citizens of the United States who were born after May 17, 1989. The application deadline is Friday, March 20.
For information on how to apply, visit www.bach.org or call 610-866-4382 x111.
Concordia Chamber Players
The Bucks County-based Concordia Chamber Players will present its 2020 annual Winter Gala concert Friday, Jan. 10 at Cradle Valley Farm in New Hope. Featured will be works performed by two masters of rhythm: percussionists Andy Akiho and Ian Rosenbaum. Akiho's profoundly invigorating compositions accompany an evening of signature drinks, wine and exquisite food.
Akiho, described by The New York Times as "mold-breaking," and "vital," is a New York City-based composer and percussionist with a special interest in works for the marimba and steel pans, which he began playing while a student at the University of South Carolina. Recent engagements include commissioned premieres by the New York Philharmonic, National Symphony Orchestra, Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, China Philharmonic Orchestra, and numerous others.
Brooklyn-based percussionist Rosenbaum has similarly been praised by the Times for his "excellent" and "precisely attuned" performances. He made his Kennedy Center debut in 2009 and later that year garnered a special prize created for him at the Salzburg International Marimba Competition. In 2012, he joined the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center's CMS Two program as only the second percussionist selected in its history.
Concordia Chamber Players, 7 p.m. Friday, January 10, Cradle Valley Farm, 6454 Meetinghouse Road, New Hope. Tickets: $150 must be reserved in advance. 215-816-0227, www.concordiaplayers.org

Pentagon warns against at-home DNA tests

Texto completo: In an internal memo, Pentagon leadership has urged military personnel not to take mail-in DNA tests, warning that they create security risks, are unreliable and could negatively affect service members' careers.
The letter, which was reported by Yahoo News, was sent last week. It does not name any particular DNA testing companies, but counsels broadly against buying ancestry and health tests promoted with military discounts and other military incentives.
Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the memo had been sent.
"We want to ensure all service members are aware of the risks of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing," he told The New York Times over email.
Over the past decade, millions of Americans have purchased DNA tests through companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry with the hopes of connecting with relatives, finding out more about their family origins and learning about how their DNA could affect their chances of developing certain health conditions.
Robertson said that the tests might provide inaccurate results and have negative professional consequences. "The unintentional discovery of markers that may affect readiness could affect a service member's career," he said.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act - known as GINA - prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes. It does not apply to members of the military, however.
The memo was written by Joseph Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and James Stewart, the assistant secretary of defense for manpower. They warn that the tests "could expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences."
In a statement, a spokeswoman from 23andMe said that the company took great care to protect customers' privacy. An Ancestry spokeswoman said that the company had not targeted military personnel with discounts.

How to work retail amid the retail apocalypse

Texto completo: NEW YORK - It's Dec. 17 and a customer at the Old Navy on 18th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan has a problem: She's looking to get matching Jingle Jammies for her family but can't find a size 3T for her son.
Daisy Tecotl has a solution. She checks the In Stock On Shelf app on her store-issued mobile device to see if there's a 3T in the stockroom. There isn't, so she opens the Order In Store app and arranges to ship it to the woman before Christmas.
The sale is reflected in yet another app, the Sell app, that pings Tecotl, a 24-year-old merchandising manager, with hourly figures on sales and credit card sign-ups and several other metrics, which she uses to broadcast guidance to "refocus" her sales associates, who, like her, are outfitted with earpieces and walkie-talkies.
This is the job of a retail clothing worker at the end of 2019: dashing back and forth between stockroom and fitting room and sales floor, online and in-store, juggling the hats of cashier and cheerleader and personal shopper and visual merchandiser and database manager.
As brick-and-mortar stores scramble to justify their continued existence, they're trying to be all things to all customers, to blend instant gratification and infinite selection. And it falls upon the workers on the front lines to make it all happen.
Entry-level associates at Old Navy have store-issued mobile devices, too, that do things like ping them when a customer buys the last item in a particular size so they can replenish it from a stockroom that holds more than 250,000 items, or ring up customers anywhere in the store's 30,000-square-foot, three-story expanse, or notify them of a BOPIS - that's Buy Online Pickup In Store, which sends an associate to find the items on the sales floor.
In New York City, retail clothing jobs declined by 9% from 2013 to 2018, even as overall employment in the city jumped about 14%. A report last week by the Center for an Urban Future found that the number of national retail chain stores in the city shrank 4% this year, the biggest drop since at least 2008.
Old Navy hopes to buck the trend. It has performed so much better than its sister chains in the Gap empire that Gap Inc. decided in February to spin off Old Navy into its own company - one that plans to open 800 new stores, despite a dip in sales this year.
But to compete in a world where Amazon moves mountains of merchandise without a retail sales force takes a particular focus, said Saravanan Kesavan, associate professor of operations at the University of North Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School.
"Retail for the most part is not a place where they're looking for salespeople," he said. "They're looking for retail transaction enablers."
At every shift, each Old Navy store employee on the sales floor is issued a "Ticket To Win," which the company describes as "a contest-driven tool" to help managers and associates "focus on how best to serve the customer and drive business results."

Texto completo: New construction and efforts to raise building and development standards in Pataskala; an inspiring Hallmark Movie-like love story and a tragic December shooting: these were just some of the incidents and initiatives that shaped the news year of 2019.
January
Licking Heights Local Schools announced it would seek voter approval in May for a "substitution levy" that would not raise taxes for current taxpayers within the school district, but would allow the district to grow its tax base as new construction occurs within district boundaries.
The Standard featured LuLu Mack's a new sit-down pasta, pizza, sandwiches and more restaurant located at 12998 E. Main Street at the corner of Mink Street.
In downtown Pataskala, Mama Linda's Pizzeria marked its 20th anniversary at 355 S. Main Street.
The Western Y Branch broke ground on its new $23.8 million improvement project.
February
A proposed Refugee Road development pitched for a site also bounded by Mink Street prompted Licking Heights School officials to raise a red flag regarding potential enrollment impacts in the already fast-growing school district that was in the process of constructing a new high school to meet demands.
March
Southwest Licking Local Schools officially broke ground for its new Watkins Memorial High School and new Watkins Intermediate School.
Amazon officially launched its offering of public tours at its Etna facility.
The Pataskala Public Library debuted its new self-checkout station.
Pataskala City Council rejected a rezoning request for the Refugee Road residential development that Licking Heights Schools had also opposed. "Hunter's Crossing" was a mixed-residential development of single-family and "empty-nester" or life-style homes.
April
The Pataskala Police Department officially took occupancy of its newly constructed headquarters at 623 W. Broad Street, behind the city office building. The new building cost an estimated $4.6 million and spans nearly 17,000 square feet.
A student using a vape pen caused a scare on a Licking Heights school bus.
A video of a Pataskala associate pastor at Impact City Church inviting physical abuse upon himself by youths as part of an after-school Easter message resulted in international media attention.
May
Pataskala resident and former marine Captain Christopher T. Orr was inducted into the Ohio Military Hall of Fame for actions undertaken in Iraq.
Licking Heights Schools narrowly passed its no-new-tax substitute levy. The measure actually failed with Licking County voters, but was carried over the victory line by margins within Franklin County.
A sinkhole just south of Mill Street closed Ohio 310 for emergency repairs.
June
A community event was held to raise funds to support the Pataskala Police K-9 unit. Overall, $3,000 was raised at the event held at Pataskala Grace Church.
July
Pataskala City Council began talking about seeking a potential formula to assess impact fees upon commercial and residential developers to ease infrastructure impacts.
Pumpkin growers were growing concerned about the Halloween crop owing to unusually wet weather.
A fire at Pataskala Oaks Care Center resulted in residents being evacuated on school buses and relocated first to a church, then to other facilities until repairs could be made. There were no injuries.
August
Lynd Fruit Farm celebrated its 100th anniversary at its Morse Road site.
The Licking County Sheriff's Office signed a contract with Etna Township for two deputies to police Etna. Under the contract, Etna pays $100,000 per deputy, per year. The township also pays approximately $50,000 over a three-year period for two new, fully equipped cruisers.
In the face of its last tenants moving on to other locations, the owners of the mostly vacant, deteriorating Pataskala Square Shopping Center announced they were interested in razing the existing structure and redeveloping the site.
Etna broke ground for ones of the largest spec structures in the U.S., located off Mink Street between Main Street and Refugee Road, totaling more than 1.2 million square feet.
September
Pataskala officials began a study toward the eventual end of tightening development standards to improve the durability and aesthetics of future residential developments within the city.
Southwest Licking Schools announced it would be installing several vape detectors in the district's middle and high school restrooms.
One of the first new buildings in downtown Pataskala opened its doors as the Ivory Barn home décor store opened to a large crowd of shoppers on Sept. 26.
October
Readers across the world were delighted by the love story of Annette Callahan and Bob Harvey, high school sweethearts who broke up 63 years ago, lived separate lives and raised families, but both widowed, reunited at Pataskala's Nutcracker 1950s-theme diner to rekindle their love.
The story of the coincidences, twists and turns that first appeared in The Pataskala Standard, became a viral sensation, prompting stories from syndicated news programs, The New York Times and several talk shows. The Standard covered the wedding on Oct. 19.
Pataskala City Council voted to place a six-month moratorium on new residential development proposals while it worked to tighten building standards and weigh impact fees.
November
Southwest Licking Local Schools attempt at a substitute levy that wouldn't raise taxes – similar to the measure narrowly passed by Licking Heights Schools earlier in the year, went down to failure by a close margin.
The Old Town Hall held an official ribbon cutting, showcasing the restored Sterling Theater atop, and new offices for the Pataskala Area Chamber of Commerce, and the city's utility department downstairs.
December
The city rang in the holiday season with a successful Christmas Cookie Walk and parade on Dec. 7.
A new study examining key intersections in Pataskala identified Ohio 16 and Summit Road as a primary and likely first intersection for which to seek grant funds for improvements and widening.

Texto completo: Here at the Just Roll With It Bakery & Tavern in Hudson, the soup of the day is broccoli and cheese and the waitress has an innocence and sweetness about her that is a hallmark of small towns in the South. The space is bright and clean, with the bakery counter to the right and tavern taps at left. Eric Clapton's soft rock is playing overhead, just loud enough to set an easy atmosphere.
Under a Mitford blue sky, Main and Elm streets are ablaze with large signs in print and neon, announcing that Jan Karon is coming to town. It's better than Santa shooting down the chimney for the people of Hudson, for its most famous native has come home for a weekend of parties, author talks, parades and meet-and-greets.
At first glance, Hudson's not a place one would imagine could sprout a No. 1 on the New York Times best-selling author who turned out 21 novels and has 40,000,000 official fans worldwide. The books, primarily set in the fictional mountain village of Mitford, centered around a pudgy, prayerful Episcopal priest and those who were magnetized to him.
On a mild fall day, the Dooby Brothers are rockin' it out from speakers mounted on light poles along Hudson's Main Street. The music, from many decades ago, is somehow jarring against the quiet nature of a downtown that appears to be two blocks long.
Hudson, like Black Mountain, includes among its residents the kind of Southerner who, upon first introduction, comes at you with arms flung open and is going to hug you whether you want it or not.
I like the Just Roll With It Bakery and Tavern, and feel sure that on tap at the bar is plenty of Southern empathy running adjacent to the beer. Mitford may not have had a bar or a liquor store, but congenial types of Southern comfort ran like rivers through the town.
Black Mountain has had many advantages that Hudson does not, such as being a nub on Western North Carolina's transport veins. The Swannanoa River flows through town, as well as its tributaries like the Flat Creek, which you see on part of the greenway and is most visible behind Ole's Guacamole. Because the river was here, the geography lent itself to the building of the train tracks, the state road, then, in my lifetime, Interstate 40 blasting through the mountainside.
We will continue to see development here, and all citizens will need to care how we develop. A good term to blaze into your memory is "view corridor." In the town's codes are specific regulations on the height of buildings in town, for instance, and how tall those buildings are affects what you can see as you look around: the view corridor.
On Highway 70, for instance, on the east and west sides of Swannanoa, two metal monstrosities have gone up, which obscure the gentle beauty of the mountains behind them as you drive by. These two big metal boxes have changed the view corridor in a horrible manner. Highway 70 is well on its way to become a filthy industrial strip.
If the view corridor is an aspect of the town that you find important to you, perhaps take notice. Black Mountain codes only regulate what is in the town limits, but that doesn't mean you can't find the right people to talk to as a tax-paying citizen of Buncombe County.
The controversial renovations of the historic brick building next to Take A Hike, for instance, are within the town code. That building, thankfully, is relatively blended into the terrain and the existing structures around it. But had the town code allowed for an extra floor or two, we would not be able to see those gorgeous mountains behind it.
The view corridor winds up being thousands of moments to tens of thousands of people who both live and visit here. If, for instance, the plot of land across from Ingles gets sold and developed, a four-story building or big box store on that gentle knoll will irrevocably change the peaceful mountain view from the Ingles parking lot and the vicinity, which is one of the reasons many of us love living here.
And so you see, this is not a time to "just roll with it." It is a time to step forward with intention.
Rather than wait for the future we don't want to live in, complaining all the way, let's take just one step each week toward being more proactive citizens. One phone call to ask a question. The next week, another phone call. Text somebody. Call somebody. Meet with somebody. It's not a matter of resisting change. It's the challenge of shaping the changes that are creating our shared future.

Texto completo: Wow, Louisville bookworms, y'all were busy this past year.
Nearly four million items, including books and other multimedia items, were checked out of Louisville Free Public Library in 2019, a seven percent increase from last year.
So what were people reading?
The Louisville Free Public Library released its list of the 10 most circulated titles in the last 365 days, including print and e-books. Many of the selections mirror national trends and bestseller lists, according to Library Director Lee Burchfield. The eclectic round-up includes high-profile memoirs, a murder mystery, coming-of-age stories and a self-help book – and seven of them were written by women.
"It's fantastic," Burchfield said. "There are so many women producing really great writing right now."
The library hosted several of those authors for book signings in 2019, including Ann Patchett, Dorothea Benton Frank, J.R. Ward, Susan Orlean and Celeste Ng, whose book "Little Fires Everywhere" is one of the most checked out books of 2019.
Burchfield said to stay tuned for other authors coming to the Louisville libraries in 2020. And for those waiting for popular books, like the titles below, the library is working hard to minimize waitlists in the next year.
Check out what people were reading in 2019, from fiction to children's books and nonfiction, too.
Most checked out books of 2019: 'Where the Crawdads Sing' by Delia Owens This story follows two timelines that slowly intertwine, one describing the life and adventures of a young girl named Kya as she grows up isolated in the marsh of North Carolina from 1952–1969, the other follows a murder investigation of Chase Andrews, a local celebrity of Barkley Cove, a fictional coastal town of North Carolina. Delia Owens' debut novel topped the New York Times Fiction Bestseller list for several weeks in 2019.
'Becoming' by Michelle Obama Described by the former first lady as a deeply personal experience, the memoir talks about Michelle Obama's roots and how she found her voice, as well as her time in the White House, her public health campaign and her role as a mother.
'Educated: A Memoir' by Tara Westover This memoir is described as "a stunning story about family, loss and the struggle for a better future." In it, Tara Westover recounts her struggle to reconcile her desire for education and autonomy with her family's rigid ideology and isolated life as religious doomsday preppers in Idaho.
'The Reckoning' by John Grisham This book by award-winning author John Grisham has been categorized by readers as "a murder mystery, a courtroom drama, a family saga, a coming-of-age story," "a period piece" and a war novel.
'Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng Following her first novel, "Everything I Never Told You," Celeste Ng's novel "Little Fires Everywhere Her" takes place in Shaker Heights, Ohio where Ng grew up. She described writing about her hometown as "a little bit like writing about a relative. According to reviews, "Little Fires Everywhere" explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity and the ferocious pull of motherhood — and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.
'Nine Perfect Strangers' by Liane Moriarty If you don't immediately recognize Liane Moriarty's name, you may remember her novel-turned-HBO-series "Big Little Lies," about the intersecting lives of three women whose children attend the same kindergarten. According to a New York Times review: "If three characters were good in 'Big Little Lies,' nine are even better in 'Nine Perfect Strangers,'" which is about a group of Australians who converge on a "boutique health and wellness resort" called Tranquillum House, all looking to change their lives in some way.
'The Great Alone' by Kristin Hannah In this portrait of human frailty and resilience, Kristin Hannah reveals the indomitable character of the modern American pioneer and the spirit of a vanishing Alaska — a place of incomparable beauty and danger. "The Great Alone" has been called a daring, beautiful, stay-up-all-night story about love and loss, the fight for survival and the wildness that lives in both man and nature.
'Look Alive Twenty-Five'by Janet Evanovich For the 25th book in her best-selling series, Janet Evanovich tells another story of Stephanie Plum, a female bounty hunter.
'Girl, Wash Your Face' by Rachel Hollis "Girl, Wash Your Face" is described by The Washington Post as mixing "memoir, motivational tips, Bible quotations and common-sense girl talk." The prevailing message of her tome is one largely of female self-reliance, best summed up by Hollis in the book as "You, and only you, are ultimately responsible for how happy you are." Girl, Wash Your Face is listed as a New York Times best-seller under the Advice, How-To, & Miscellaneous category.
'Long Road to Mercy' by David Baldacci "Long Road to Mercy" is the heart-pounding first novel in the FBI Special Agent Atlee Pine series by bestselling author David Baldacci.

PLOWING THROUGH SNOW REMOVAL NOW AS EASY AS ORDERING TAKEOUT ON YOUR PHONE

Texto completo: Neighborhood kids looking to make some extra money shoveling snow could face more competition than usual this year.
A handful of companies want to make it easier to connect customers with local vendors offering snow removal services. In fact, they want to make it just as easy as ordering a ride from Uber or takeout from Postmates - and they are bringing their services to Pittsburgh this winter.
GreenPal, based in Nashville, Tenn., and Lawn Love, based in San Diego, already have set up shop in Pittsburgh through online platforms to help local lawn care service providers find more customers and streamline their business operations. For customers, they want to help them find the right vendors for their specific jobs, whether that's a weekly lawn mowing appointment or a radical landscape design.
Both companies announced they are adding snow removal to their list of available services in Pittsburgh this week after requests from both vendors and customers.
"It's kind of like, if you don't do it, you're missing out," said GreenPal co-founder Gene Caballero.
GreenPal, which launched seven years ago, put Pittsburgh on a short list of cities to roll out the addition of snow removal services. That lists also includes Baltimore, Chicago, Minneapolis and Indianapolis.
To request a service, customers upload information about their request and a desired service date to GreenPal's website. From there, local vendors can bid on the job, and the customer can select a company based on things like pricing, past reviews and the vendor's ranking.
Vendors typically charge $30 to $40 for lawn mowing and $35 to $45 for snow removal. GreenPal takes 5% of the profits made through each transaction, according to Mr. Caballero.
Mr. Caballero said he and his co-founders are not "tech guys," but landscape guys who recognized a disconnect in the way contractors were creating and growing their businesses. The traditional methods of advertising - knocking on doors, purchasing radio ads, hanging flyers - weren't sustainable, he said.
After working in technology sales, Mr. Caballero predicted that if people were willing to have a stranger pick up their dinner, they'd soon do the same for their home and lawn services.
Mr. Caballero said GreenPal generated $15 million in gross revenue in 2019 and expects to double that to $30 million in 2020.
Lawn Love also is one of many tech startups working to adapt the on-demand service model for lawn care and home needs. How the platform works differs from company to company, as does the level of control the vendors and the customers have. The overarching goals are the same, though: Save the customers time by putting all their available resources in one place, and save the vendors time by handling the logistics and payment side of things.
Lawn Love doesn't offer customers multiple bids as GreenPal does, but instead takes over the logistics so the customer doesn't have to. Not doing it that way would be like asking a customer to select an Uber driver based on the car's make and model, rather than letting the app find the best ride, Lawn Love CEO and co-founder Jeremy Yamaguchi said.
When a customer makes a request, Lawn Love uses satellite imagery from Google Maps and its own algorithms to provide the contractor with a view of the property before they leave for the job.
Both companies like to compare their platform to an "Uber for lawn care," but it could be tricky to replicate the snow removal service in the same instantaneous, on-demand fashion.
Contractors pointed to problems with getting from one side of the city to the other in a timely enough fashion to meet the customer's requests or the added liability of damaging shrubbery or scraping up concrete when they have never seen the property not covered in a blanket of snow.
Traditionally, customers sign up for a seasonal snow removal plan, meaning they have an agreement with a contractor to come out whenever the forecast starts to predict snow fall. Some contractors offer a flat rate no matter how many or how few times its services are actually needed and others offer a pay-as-you-go type plan. Customers, from businesses and corporations to individual homes, usually have already formed a connection with the contractor.
"Snow removal is very, very tricky. Ninety five percent of my customers are already lined up," said Rob Mitlo, owner of Local Properties Lawn Care Service, which is based in Bethel Park and works with GreenPal and LawnStarter, another lawn service digital platform. "They know if there's a snow event or even an icing event, they don't have to pick up the phone to call me. They already know that we'll be there."
Both Lawn Love and GreenPal can be used to set up seasonal plans. But the on-demand requests might not be that quick because there is still a "pecking order" that must be followed, Mr. Mitlo said.
Brandon Delaney, office manager for Highland Park-based landscaping company Gardenalia, said he hadn't heard of these types of platforms yet but could see how they would be useful for connecting people to the right services. The downside, he said, is that large corporate clients that make snow removal companies the most money during this season probably won't be searching through an app for a new contractor.
Though signing up for a service on an online platform or mobile application isn't that different from making a phone call, Mr. Delaney said he thinks people are still more "old-school" than that, particularly when it comes to snow.
"People are kind of worried about it," he said, referring to the increase in call volume when snow is even predicted. "I think people feel more secure to sit there and actually talk to someone, especially when some people are putting their security in your hands."
The industry is still new - Martin Tirado, of the Milwaukee-based Snow and Ice Management Association, said he just started noticing these types of platforms about five years ago - so its "true applicability" remains to be seen, he said.
"I think they're still in the exploratory phase," Mr. Tirado said. "They haven't taken over like, I guess, on-demand Uber driving has."

DOUBLE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE

Texto completo: An editorial from The New York Times
Opponents of minimum-wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and, if required to pay higher wages, they will employ fewer workers.
Now there is evidence that such concerns, never entirely sincere, are greatly overstated.
Over the past five years, a wave of increases in state and local minimum-wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the United States to the highest level on record. The average worker must be paid at least $11.80 an hour - more after inflation than the last peak, in the 1960s, according to an analysis by economist Ernie Tedeschi.
And even as wages have marched upward, job growth remains strong. The unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year.
The interventions by some state and local governments, however, do not obviate the need for federal action. To the contrary. Millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states still use the federal standard, $7.25 an hour, which has not risen since 2009 - the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s.
Across much of America, the minimum wage is set to rise again in the next few days. In Maine and Colorado it will reach $12; in Washington, $13.50; in New York City, $15. Workers in the rest of the country also deserve a raise. The time has come to increase the federal minimum.
House Democrats passed legislation in July that would gradually increase the federal standard, to $15 an hour in 2025 - likely raising the real value above the peak value in the late 1960s - and most of the Democrats running for president have endorsed the legislation. Last year, only about 430,000 people - or 0.5% of hourly workers - were paid the federal minimum. The share has fallen in recent years as state and local governments, and some employers, have stepped in. But a much larger group of workers stand to benefit, because they now earn less than the proposed minimum. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $15 minimum hourly wage would raise the pay of at least 17 million workers.
Among the beneficiaries: people who work for tips. Federal law lets businesses pay $2.13 an hour to waiters, bartenders and others who get tips, so long as the total of tips and wages meets the federal minimum. The legislation would end that rule; the same minimum would apply to all hourly employees. Opponents of the change argue customers will curtail tipping and workers will end up with less money. But eight states, including Minnesota, Montana and Oregon, already have a universal minimum, including for tipped workers, and restaurant workers in those states make more money.
Crucially, the legislation also would require automatic adjustments in the minimum wage to keep pace with wage growth in the broader economy. The current minimum rises only when Congress is in the mood. As a result, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has eroded by nearly 40% over the past half-century. A full-time worker making the minimum wage cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment in almost any U.S. city.
The simplistic view that minimum-wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987, calling it "an idea whose time has passed," and citing as evidence "a virtual consensus among economists." The old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low-wage workers.
But evidence that any such effects are relatively small has been piling up for several decades. A groundbreaking study published in 1993 by economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum-wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania. It found no effect on employment.
This prompted other economists to test the standard theory. This year, the British government asked economist Arindrajit Dube to review the results accumulated over the last quarter-century. Mr. Dube reported the sum total of the research showed minimum-wage increases raised compensation while producing a "very muted effect" on employment.
The patchwork nature of recent minimum-wage increases - the rate rising in some jurisdictions while staying the same in adjacent areas - is offering new opportunities for research.
Consider, for instance, the situation along the New York-Pennsylvania border. New York state has been raising its minimum wage since 2016. On Tuesday, the legal minimum will reach $11.80 outside New York City. Pennsylvania, meanwhile, is among the 21 states where the $7.25 minimum remains in force. In September, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that wages have climbed significantly in counties along the New York side of the state line, again without a discernible difference in the pace of employment growth.
For most companies, the bill is relatively small, and it can be defrayed by giving less money to shareholders, or by raising prices. Opponents often argue minimum-wage increases will encourage automation, but the point is easily overstated. Companies constantly invest in technology: McDonald's is installing self-order kiosks across the United States, not just at places with higher minimum wages. And instead of replacing workers with robots, companies may choose to invest in technology that enhances the productivity of their workforce.
More than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change, and it is not without risk. It is possible that a national $15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted; the Congressional Budget Office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3.7 million people, essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable.
Workers may be most vulnerable in areas where prevailing wages are relatively low. In California, for example, the minimum wage for large employers (more than 25 workers) rose to $13 an hour Wednesday. That is unlikely to cause problems in San Francisco - but the new minimum is quite close to the median hourly wage of $15.23 in the Visalia metropolitan area in the Central Valley. The federal minimum would apply to metropolitan areas like Daphne, Alabama, and Sumter, South Carolina, where the median worker earned less than $15 an hour in 2018.
One simple corrective, proposed by Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, would be to include exemptions from the $15 standard for low-wage metropolitan areas and rural areas.
But the successful increases in minimum-wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking. The U.S. economy is generating plenty of jobs; the problem is in the paychecks. The solution is a $15 federal minimum wage.

Texto completo: Casting news to get you ready for a new year of Pittsburgh theater:
'Downstairs,' City Theatre
City Theatre has announced a veteran Pittsburgh cast for "Downstairs" by Theresa Rebeck, Broadway's most produced female playwright. Martin Giles, Helena Ruoti and John Shepard star in the play about "family secrets, regrets and the threat of madness in the search for the good life."
The play was written for siblings Tyne and Tim Daly, and when it debuted off-Broadway in November 2018, Lauren Collins-Hughes wrote in The New York Times that the "chilling new domestic thriller ... is about the realization that horrific actions that might have seemed solely the province of scary movies, or paranoid delusions, can be perpetrated by people in your life."
City Theatre artistic director Marc Masterson has previously directed or produced five plays by Rebeck, the creator of NBC's "Smash" and the play "Seminar," which had a 2013 production at City.
"She is smart and prolific and fierce and an acknowledged leader in our field," said Masterson, who will direct his first Main Stage show since his return to City Theatre last season.
City Theatre, South Side; Jan. 11-Feb. 2; www.citytheatrecompany.org or 412-431-CITY.
'Little Shop of Horrors,' Pittsburgh Public Theater
Pittsburgh Public Theater kicks off 2020 with the musical "Little Shop of Horrors," which is experiencing a coast-to-coast revival of late: off-Broadway, with Jonathan Groff and Christian Borle, and an all-star concert version in L.A.
Marya Sea Kaminski directs her first musical at the Public, with Grammy-winner John McDaniel as music director.
The cast includes Carnegie Mellon University grad Philippe Arroyo as Seymour, Marc Moritz as Mr. Mushnik, Lauren Marcus of Broadway's "Be More Chill" as Audrey and Patrick Cannon as sadistic dentist Orin. Monteze Freeland provides the voice, and J. Alex Noble is the puppeteer of the mean green so-and-so from outer space.
As the Urchins, Melessie Clark, Tavia Riveé and Abigail Stephenson are the chorus when "Little Shop" arrives at the O'Reilly Theater, Downtown; Jan. 23-Feb. 23; ppt.org or 412-316-1600.
'Hair,' Pittsburgh Musical Theater
Ken Gargaro returns to Pittsburgh Musical Theater to direct "Hair" at the theater that bears his name.
The large cast of the '60s counterculture musical includes many familiar faces, including Elizabeth Boyke, Ashton Guthrie, Jason Shavers, Brady D. Patsy, Joe York and Anthony Marino Jr.
At PMT's Gargaro Theater, West End; Jan. 23-Feb. 2; pittsburghmusicals.com.
'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' PICT Classic Theatre
Shammen McCune is continuing a run of Shakespearean roles, joining Allan Snyder to lead the cast of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." After Pittsburgh Public Theater's "The Tempest" as Brutus and Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks' "Julius Caesar" as Brutus, she gets to have a little fun in the comic fantasy, "a new midwinter" adaptation by director Alan Stanford.
The cast includes busy Martin Giles and James FitzGerald as Bottom and Peter Quince, respectively; Lamar K. Cheston (City Theatre's "One Night in Miami ...") as Lysander and David Toole making his PICT debut as Demetrius. Rounding out the principal cast are Zoe Abuyuan as Helena, Saige Smith as Hermia and Jacob Epstein as Puck.
"A Midsummer Night's Dream" is at WQED's Fred Rogers Studio, Oakland; Feb. 13-29; www.picttheatre.org or 412-561-6000.

Texto completo: Call him Ishmael.
WGBH executive arts editor Jared Bowen will serve as the honorary Ishmael on Saturday, Jan. 4, kicking off the New Bedford Whaling Museum's annual “Moby-Dick" marathon reading, starting at noon.
“The New Bedford Whaling Museum reached out to me and asked — I was delighted to do it," Bowen said. “I'm really enthusiastic about what the museum is doing and how they're bringing people together. It's pretty striking."
Hundreds are expected to gather in New Bedford — from school kids to Melville scholars — to read Herman Melville 's 1851 epic in its entirety. All told, it takes about 25 hours.
Some 200 volunteers take turns reading, while others gather by the world's largest whaleship model to listen. The museum is free and open to the public during the marathon. Still others can watch via live­stream on YouTube, or follow #mobydickmarathon on Twitter.
Since 1997, the museum has celebrated the anniversary of Melville's storied January 1841 departure from the Port of New Bedford aboard the whaleship Acushnet with the literary celebration.
Everything kicks off Friday, Jan. 3, with a ticketed dinner and presentation by Melville scholar Mary K. Bercaw Edwards. Aside from the massive reading of the whale tale, attendees can find theatrical performances, art exhibitions, lectures and discussions, a kids read-a-thon, and a trivia session. Fuel up on coffee, chowder, beer. A local acting troupe is set to perform one of the chapters.
Not everyone stays the whole time — but those who do earn a prize when the book reaches its end, at around 1 p.m. Sunday.
A Portuguese-language reading of Tiago Patricio 's abridged “Moby-Dick" starts at 3 p.m. Saturday, with readers from New Bedford, Portugal, the Azores, and Cape Verde taking turns in a virtual marathon via Skype.
“New Bedford has strong and rich ties to the Portuguese diaspora, and we celebrate each culture that has made this region so unique," explains Tina Malott , director of marketing and public relations for the New Bedford Whaling Museum. “Given how our current region's cultural makeup is largely a result of the whaling era, 'Moby-Dick' holds a dear place in our hearts as a narrative from the era."
“I think that more than ever we need convenings like this," said Bowen. “Where we can make a deep dive into literature, consider history, consider ourselves, and gain some perspective in very troubled times."
There have been other notable Ishmaels over the years, according to the museum, including Nathaniel Philbrick , the New York Times best-selling author of “In the Heart of the Sea" and “Why Read Moby-Dick" in 2016; Melville's great-great-grandson Peter Gansevoort Whittemore took the role in 2017; and Jim Braude and Margery Eagen , cohosts of WGBH's “Boston Public Radio," who shared the role in 2019.
“I love hearing the book read aloud, and each time find that I'm hearing words I never heard before, or in that way before," Wyn Kelly , a senior lecturer at MIT and founding member of the Melville Society Cultural Project, said in an e-mail.
The MSCP is a research-oriented group of scholars within the Melville Society dedicated to fostering a critical understanding of Melville's writings, life, and times. Six Melville scholars from six states comprise the Melville Society Cultural Project, according to the museum.
“Having just taught the book this fall, I was struck by students' excitement. They were especially thrilled that the book addresses issues important to them — climate change and species decline, racial and social justice, fluid sexuality and gender roles, art, language, and history, and, let's not forget, heaps of salty humor," Kelly said.
“The New Bedford marathon is a huge community festival that celebrates the city's labor, history, and culture during momentous times," said Kelly. “I love that New Bedford is still a working port, that Melville might still feel very much at home here. I sense his spirit here and think maybe I've gotten a whiff of his pipe tobacco smoke when I turn a corner and catch a puff of salty air."

SJC rules in favor of UMass journalist

Texto completo: In a closely watched defamation case, the state's highest court has ruled in favor of a one-time editor at a University of Massachusetts student newspaper.
The Supreme Judicial Court said Cady Vishniac can't be held liable for publishing a synopsis of a police blotter item alongside photos police released to help them find an allegedly suspicious man who was reported to be taking photos of women — but who later denied the allegations, was never charged, and whose phone wasn't found to have any such images.
The court affirmed that journalists are protected from defamation claims when they fairly and accurately report about official public actions and proceedings, a legal idea known as the fair report privilege.
“Once police undertake an official response to a complaint, both that response and the allegations that gave rise to it fall within the fair report privilege," Justice Barbara A. Lenk wrote.
But the court declined to extend that privilege to all reports in public records such as police logs because they may include anonymous complaints making accusations of criminal activity.
“Such anonymous accusations, without a subsequent response by police, are neither official statements nor official actions cloaked by the fair report privilege," the ruling said.
Frank D. LoMonte, a professor of media law at the University of Florida who has followed the case, said the ruling “is a fairly narrow reaffirmation of basic, accepted principles of privilege."
LoMonte, also director of the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information, said the ruling gave no indication that the court sees student journalists any differently than professional journalists.
“There's nothing to indicate that a student media outlet will get less benefit in the eyes of the law," he said.
The case — which could have gone to trial if the SJC had ruled the other way — revolves around an incident on March 13, 2013, that court records describe in detail. University of Massachusetts Boston police received a report that an unknown man was engaging in suspicious activity near campus, with a witness telling police that he was taking photos of women on a bus. Police couldn't find him.
A police blotter report about the incident was published by the school newspaper, Mass Media.
Later, UMass police received photographs from the bus company. At the request of police, Mass Media published the photos. They ran under the title “Have you Seen This Man?" and included a synopsis of the incident that described the man as allegedly snapping pictures of women “without their permission," and a request for people to call campus security if they saw him.
Jon Butcher, then a security engineer at UMass Boston's information technology department, was subsequently identified as the person in the photos. Attempts to reach him Wednesday by phone and e-mail were not successful.
UMass police took his phone and searched image files on it. None of the ones dated March 13, 2013, were of women; several showed buses and a bus driver.
In court documents, Butcher said he took photos to document what he believed to be serious safety concerns about the bus company and its drivers. The documents note that a year after the incident, the bus company was shut down due to safety issues. Butcher also said he was accosted by a driver who saw what he was doing.
After the publication of the stories, Butcher said he felt negative repercussions at work and feared for his safety, according to court documents. Bus drivers kept copies of the newspaper articles about him open on their dashboards, he was given a higher volume of low-level work, and he was left out of key meetings, he said. Months later, he left his UMass job.
In 2014, Butcher filed suit in superior court against UMass, university officials, and Vishniac, who had been a student and the newspaper's news editor when the items and photos were published. His claims included defamation and emotional distress. The court ruled in favor of the defendants.
But the state appeals court said the lower court erred and the newspaper's publication of the item accompanied by the photos wasn't protected by the fair report privilege.
The office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey subsequently stepped in to defend the former student editor, deeming the case to be in the public's interest.
And Vishniac, who hasn't practiced any sort of journalism since her time at UMass, appealed to the state's highest court, which ruled in her favor on the last day of 2019.
“I am so completely relieved," Vishniac, now 34, said Wednesday — relieved for herself, she said, and also for any newspaper editor who puts a simple police blotter item in a newspaper.
Jeffrey J. Pyle, an attorney with Prince Lobel Tye, who has represented The New York Times and The Boston Globe, said he sees the ruling “as a win for crime journalism in Massachusetts."
“This was a case where a student newspaper largely reprinted what was in a campus police blotter and the court recognized that's protected," he said.

'Hate Crime' Is Only a Step Away From Thoughtcrime

Texto completo: Does it make sense that a person can burn an American flag with impunity but not a gay-pride flag? Earlier this month, a judge in Story County, Iowa, sentenced Adolfo Martinez to a preposterous 16 years in prison for swiping the rainbow flag from a nearby church and burning it in front of a strip club.
Mr. Martinez, 30, has a long criminal history, which partly explains the long sentence. He had two felony convictions, and Iowa law deems any three-time felon an "habitual offender," subject to enhanced sentencing. But a jury convicted Mr. Martinez of three misdemeanors -- third-degree arson, for which the maximum penalty is two years in prison, along with third-degree harassment and the reckless use of fire, each subject to a maximum one-year term.
Mr. Martinez complicated his own defense by telling a local TV station that he had torched the flag because he didn't like gay people and had "burned down their pride, plain and simple." In response, the judge increased the misdemeanor arson charge to a hate-crime charge -- a felony, normally carrying a maximum of five years in prison. So what seemed on its face to be a minor infraction suddenly became Mr. Martinez's strike three, inflating his five-year maximum to 15, plus an extra year for the reckless use of fire.
The absurdity of the sentence points up the larger absurdity of hate crimes as a class of criminal offense. Burning an American flag, the Supreme Court says, is free speech. The First Amendment allows you to register disapproval of the government in whatever expressive way you choose, though watch out for the arson laws. Calling the cops "pigs" or singing "F-- da Police"? Also no problem, legally speaking. Unlike Canada, Europe and American colleges, the U.S. doesn't have "hate speech" laws.
The idea that free speech means free speech is a jewel of American exceptionalism. It's odious and moronic to deny the Holocaust, but it isn't -- and shouldn't be -- a crime. The New York Times didn't clutch its pearls when Hillary Clinton dismissed Donald Trump's supporters as a "deplorables" who are "irredeemable" and "not America." Nor did the guardians of correct opinion blanch when Barack Obama disparaged a large number of Americans as troglodytes clinging to their guns and religion. Rep. Ilhan Omar is entirely at liberty to explain away support for Israel as being "all about the Benjamins, baby." Robert De Niro is similarly free to give the finger to Mr. Trump and his supporters. All this is as American as apple pie, if less appetizing.
Designating an offense as a hate crime criminalizes not the action but the idea that supposedly impelled it. Here we are but a step away from the "thoughtcrime" George Orwell described in "1984."
Properly, the law should ask only two questions about your state of mind. First, do you have the faculty of reason that allows you to distinguish right from wrong? Second, did you intend to do the crime you committed? Beyond that, as James Madison repeatedly insisted, you have freedom of conscience. You can believe whatever you want, however politically incorrect -- especially since today's political correctness may be deemed tyranny in retrospect. In a far-flung republic composed of various subgroups, multiple viewpoints and interests are bound to proliferate. Under such circumstances, toleration is required.
The New York area has experienced a rash of what Gov. Andrew Cuomo denounces as "hate crimes." Swastikas have been scrawled in largely Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. Adolescent thugs have assaulted Hasidim on the streets. In mid-December three customers and a cop were murdered in an attack on a Jersey City, N.J., kosher market. On Saturday, a madman stabbed five people at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, N.Y., north of the city.
I abhor these offenses, but I don't see what is gained by Mr. Cuomo's apoplectic imprecations. These outrages don't presage pogroms, and it seems a fair bet that the perpetrators don't know what the Holocaust was. Did it matter to the victims whether their assailants attacked them to steal their money, express their hostility, or take advantage of their vulnerability? Surely the solution isn't relabeling but rather energetic and activist policing of the kind that discouraged violent acts by ill-socialized adolescents and street-dwelling crazies in New York for 20 golden years. Proactive policing also largely rid the streets of graffiti, offensive symbols included.
Let cops vigorously enforce existing laws against assault, harassment, vandalism, arson and the like. If the harassment amounts to an organized campaign of repression rather than random acts of delinquents or lunatics, then it's time to dust off the Reconstruction Era's antiterrorism laws. No group, whether Klansmen or members of an antifa mob, should be allowed to threaten or brutalize people.
It's a sad reflection on the failure of New York's current political culture, with its recent soft-on-crime legislation and abhorrence of common-sense policing, that ordinary people must think hard about the less appealing alternative of pressing for more teeth in the Supreme Court's Heller decision, upholding citizens' Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.

Texto completo: A drama based on a miraculous Missouri incident airs on HBO. And Lifetime airs a follow-up to its much-viewed R. Kelly documentary series.
What's on TV
BREAKTHROUGH (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO. A tragedy happens on ice -- and an apparent miracle happens off it -- in this faith-based drama from the TV veteran Roxann Dawson. The screenplay is based on an actual 2015 incident in which John Smith, a Missouri teenager, fell through the frozen surface of a lake and remained submerged long enough for his heart to stop. It started pumping blood again after he was brought to a hospital -- but reportedly only when his mother audibly prayed for him. That event and the community's subsequent push to aid in John's recovery are at the center of this movie, which follows John (Marcel Ruiz), his mother (Chrissy Metz) and father (Josh Lucas) and a young pastor (Topher Grace). The film "tells the story of John's miraculous ordeal with an unassuming simplicity, focusing on the harrowing details of the case without an overreliance on proselytization," Bilge Ebiri wrote in his review for The New York Times. Though faith is ever-present, he added, "the film also wisely dedicates plenty of screen time to the emergency workers and doctors struggling to bring the boy back to life. Here, religion is not in contention with medicine, but seems to work in tandem with it."
DEPUTY 9 p.m. on Fox. The director David Ayer and the screenwriter Will Beall created this new series, which mixes police procedural and western genres. Its premiere introduces a Los Angeles officer (Stephen Dorff) who reluctantly assumes the mantle of sheriff after the sudden death of his superior. (He's the kind of live wire who says things like "policy and procedure be damned.")
SURVIVING R. KELLY PART II: THE RECKONING 9 p.m. on Lifetime. A year ago, Lifetime aired "Surviving R. Kelly," a documentary series that dove into allegations of sexual abuse against the R&B singer R. Kelly. (Kelly has since been criminally charged in multiple jurisdictions on allegations that he sexually abused minors.) This five-part follow-up continues that dive, looking at Kelly's legal troubles and how his accusers' lives have been affected since they spoke out.
What's Streaming
RAISE HELL: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF MOLLY IVINS (2019) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. There's a clip in this documentary, about the Texas-based columnist Molly Ivins famous for wittily skewering politicians, in which she tells a story about writing for this newspaper. She had described a man as having "a beer gut that belongs in the Smithsonian"; that was changed, she laments, to "protuberant abdomen." Thankfully, Ivins's idiosyncratic tone is intact in "Raise Hell," which uses interviews and archival footage to revisit her life and work. (She died in 2007.) "Whether you chuckle or snort will likely depend on your political persuasion, though it's clear that the filmmakers aren't aiming to seduce conservatives," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "This is a loving, at times fawning portrait aimed at the Ivins faithful -- her 'beloveds,' as she addressed her readers -- who read her syndicated columns and best-selling books or showed up for her speeches."

Texto completo: Also this week, holiday fireworks in Iceland and beyond
Welcome to the Climate Fwd: newsletter. The New York Times climate team emails readers once a week with stories and insights about climate change. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. (And find the website version of this week's letter here .)
New Year's resolutions suggest an abstract faith in the future. If we do this thing, we tell ourselves, our 2020 selves will look or act or feel better than our 2019 selves did. There's an implicit acknowledgment that change is possible and that we are capable of making it happen (though just under half of us won't hold on to our resolutions through February).
Talking about fighting climate change is a lot like that: Here's what things look like if nothing changes. But if we reduce greenhouse gas emissions by a little -- through the end of February, maybe -- what happens? If we reduce them by a lot, what will the world look like and what will it take to make that happen?
At once we're thinking about the present, modeling the future and thinking about how those models might differ depending on what we decide to do.
Climate change tends to scramble time, defying our sense of an orderly progression. As Robert Macfarlane, the chronicler of nature, climate, and the environment, has said, "We burn Carboniferous-era fossil fuels to melt Pleistocene-era ice to determine Anthropocene future climates."
In so doing, we accelerate all kinds of phenomena: the melting of polar ice sheets and glaciers; mass die-offs of coral reefs. Of the billions of tons of greenhouse gases we've added to the atmosphere, more than half have come in my lifetime, since 1990. We hurl ourselves into the future with increasingly precise models, only to be outpaced by our distortions of nature.
In light of all that, it is easy to feel defeated and powerless. But in the same way that you can imagine a better you, your New Year's resolution can imagine a better planet, because it's always possible to do something.
We know what happens if we give up and do nothing: Things only get worse. Currently we are on track for 3 degrees Celsius of warming by the end of the century. One million species of plants and animals are at risk of extinction over the next few decades. Natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires are already becoming more frequent and stronger. Incremental changes today, like sea-level rise, will be catastrophic by 2100.
Climate change is not a problem that can be solved or mitigated enough by individual behavior, though it is good, important and a place to start. It's easy to feel defeated after reading a set of facts like the one above and knowing that changes in our own personal habits aren't enough.
I recognize that this might seem to fly in the face of the very concept of a New Year's Resolution. But it doesn't, actually.
We can't fix this alone. We can't all do everything. But, we can all do one thing. So just pick one thing -- whether it's eating less red meat, or composting, or riding your bike to work, or cleaning up plastic litter in your community, or buying secondhand clothing -- and actually do it.
Maybe it will make you think change is possible, or you'll think, "That wasn't so hard," and that maybe you could do another thing. Maybe it will reduce your carbon footprint or cause less pollution.
Maybe it will remind you that the most important change we can make as individuals is to stay focused on all the work that still needs to be done. The work that all of us -- particularly companies and countries -- need to do together to sidestep catastrophe. The work that we all need to make sure gets done.
I can't prove any of that, but I can say that it is entirely possible to do one thing, even after February.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- Fireworks are a spectacular way to celebrate the new year, but they can also give you an environmental hangover: a cloud of nasty pollution that can stick around for hours.
That's a problem here in Reykjavik, Iceland's capital city.
It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that New Year's fireworks have become something of a national sport for Icelanders. Starting Dec. 28, families drive to pop-up stores to stock up on rockets, flares and cake fireworks for the big night.
The cakes -- which can fire many shots in sequence -- are big sellers, and many bear the names of heroes and heroines from the Icelandic sagas. There is an explosive cake named for Gisli Sursson, an outlaw who was killed in battle after years on the lam, as well as for his wife, Audur Vesteinsdottir, who fought by his side in his final battle. (And one heroine with a cake named in her honor, Aud the Deep-Minded, was supposedly my 30th great-grandmother.)
You can see how all of this might appeal to a country that prizes its Viking heritage.
As midnight nears in Reykjavik, people all over the city bring out bags filled with fireworks, lay them out in the streets and light the fuses. What follows is something like a pyrotechnical bender.
Fireworks explode all around, and you might have a hard time deciding in which direction to look. The colors transform the skyline, and the sounds echo across every street and neighborhood.
Then the smoke starts thickening, sometimes obscuring the show.
How much smoke is there? Remember that volcano, Eyjafjallajokull, whose name you probably can't pronounce? The one that disrupted European air travel in 2010?
Well, it's not as big as the ash plume that came from that. But it's more than enough to be harmful for people with respiratory illnesses and other sensitive groups. In the past, some people have ended up hospitalized.
Last month, my friends at The New York Times wrote an article about air pollution that allowed readers to compare their own cities to others around the world that have some of the dirtiest air. The project noted that, once a year, Reykjavik's air is very, very bad.
Some Icelanders were not happy with the characterization. "It is very misleading to show Reykjavik as one of the most polluted cities in the world," one reader wrote.
Well, The Times wasn't trying to single out Reykjavik as a bad actor. Lots of other places have fireworks pollution, like Germany, where some areas have imposed restrictions on private fireworks displays over concerns about fine dust particles. And in India this fall, the government allowed only eco-friendly fireworks for Diwali.
Fireworks can also affect air quality in the United States on the Fourth of July and in China during Chinese New Year celebrations.
But the fireworks in Iceland are increasingly a topic of discussion. When Saevar Helgi Bragason, a science communicator and author, called for a fireworks ban two years ago, his post on Twitter started a national conversation.
Last month, the Environment Agency of Iceland, which monitors air quality, urged people to use fireworks in moderation. Even so, many Icelanders remain fervent supporters of the fireworks. And perhaps it's not just because they like looking at them.
Much of the proceeds from fireworks sales go to support volunteer search-and-rescue teams, a cause that is close to many Icelandic hearts. Iceland has no military, just a small Coast Guard, so these volunteer teams carry out many missions. Many Icelanders view them as good Samaritans who deserve the public's support, a fact that has made restricting fireworks a sensitive issue.
The rescue teams have recently started offering an alternative to the fireworks: People can now support them by paying for the planting of trees.
Happy New Year!

Texto completo: Readers offer different views of those who earn money by rummaging through trash bags to collect recyclables.
To the Editor:
Re "In New York, Making Ends Meet on the 5-Cent Recycling Deposit" (front page, Dec. 26):
I have worked for the waste and recycling services industry for nearly 30 years all over the Northeast, including New York City.
Your article portrays canners in a noble way, but to my way of thinking it is misleading. Canner (scavenging) activity is really not helpful to the system of managing bottles and containers after their useful life. Many cities and communities have anti-scavenging laws to prevent those among us who look for valuable materials placed at the curb in trash bins, recycling containers or commercial dumpsters.
These laws help keep scavengers safe, and help prevent litter, vectors, and other public health and safety-related problems. Anti-scavenging laws also help protect the fiscal health of communities, since scavenging activity diverts revenue from being credited to the community's balance sheet.
Life on the street is difficult, and we should be working to get those who scavenge into programs that are available through city, faith and nonprofit communities. We can and should do much better for them!
New York should, going forward, establish a bottle deposit law only for wine and liquor bottles. Glass does not do well in curbside recycling programs because it breaks. Aluminum and plastic bottles and cans, on the other hand, are perfect for curbside recycling and for our sustainability goals.
Steve Changaris

To the Editor:
When I worked to pass New York's bottle bill in 1982, I made the point that children would pick up empty beverage containers to supplement their allowances. Little did I know that the growing problem of income inequality would result in thousands of people relying on nickel deposits as a source of income.
New York's bottle bill is a litter prevention and recycling success. Canners, whom I prefer to call redeemers, provide a public service.
It makes sense to update the 1982 law by increasing the nickel deposit to a dime and by adding noncarbonated beverage containers such as iced teas and wine and liquor. The Department of Sanitation is opposed because it does not want to lose money from recyclables from its curbside recycling program.
This can be remedied by the city providing funding to nonprofit organizations to establish new redemption centers, which would make life easier for the redeemers. The redemption center could be required to send material to recycling companies that the city has contracts with.
We're facing a plastic pollution crisis with nine million tons of plastic worldwide entering the ocean each year. The state bottle bill is effective in preventing plastic containers from being littered and entering water bodies. That alone should inspire New York City government to help ensure the success of this program and making life a little easier for the many redeemers who are keeping city parks and streets cleaner.

Vegan Too Strict for You? Try a 'Plant Based' Diet

Texto completo: There's a difference between disavowing all animal byproducts and simply trying to eat less meat.
The terms "vegan" and "plant-based" are often used interchangeably, but there's a growing effort to define just what it means to follow a plant-based lifestyle.
According to Brian Wendel, the founder of the "plant-based living" website Forks Over Knives, going plant-based is often "for people who are very enthusiastic about the health angle" of eating mainly whole plant foods.
Reynolde Jordan, who runs a food blog called Plant-Based Vibe in Memphis, said it's also a way to distance oneself from the rigid ideology of veganism, which calls for abstaining from animal products of all kinds.
"When you classify yourself as vegan, you're now being watched," said Mr. Jordan, who posts vegan recipes for dishes such as Cajun seaweed gumbo and raw beet balls along with photos of the vegetarian meals he orders on trips. "In my DMs, I'd get all these messages from activists for protests. I'm just not that guy -- I did this for the purpose of eating better."
Mr. Jordan is one of a growing number of health-conscious consumers embracing a plant-based lifestyle. Unlike many vegans who adhere to a philosophy of animal rights, those going plant-based tend to be inspired by research showing the health benefits of a diet made up of largely fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, grains and nuts. Free from specific ethical constraints, plant-based eaters often have no qualms buying or wearing items made with or tested on animals.
Awareness of the term is growing. And though just 6 percent of Americans eat vegetarian, according to Nielsen, almost 40 percent now make an effort to eat more plant-based foods.
Plant-Based Eating Enters the Mainstream
In 2015, Beyoncé wrote in an email to The New York Times: "First it's important that you know I am not a vegan." However she and Jay-Z co-own a food company with Marco Borges, their personal trainer, called 22 Days Nutrition, which promotes what is essentially a vegan diet.
But as Mr. Borges later explained to The Times, Beyoncé eats a "plant-based breakfast daily" and consumes no meat on Mondays. Jay-Z, meanwhile, eats "2 plant-based meals a day," he wrote in an email.
The number of food and drink products made in the United States that use "plant-based" in their labeling spiked 287 percent between 2012 and 2018, according to the consumer research firm Mintel.
Plant-based items such as jerky, ice cream and protein bars are becoming increasingly common on supermarket shelves. Fast-food chains including Dunkin' Donuts and Burger King have even started offering plant-based menu options such as the Impossible Whopper.
Some restaurants, such as Café Gratitude, a small chain in Southern California, have even rebranded themselves as entirely plant-based after originally characterizing their menus as vegan. In 2016, after a website dug up a year-old blog post by the restaurant's owners revealing they had begun raising and slaughtering animals on their family farm, many vegans boycotted and picketed the chain while its founders reportedly received death threats.
In the wake of the controversy, the restaurant made a "conscious choice" to rebrand as entirely plant-based, according to its head chef, Dreux Ellis.
But with the abundance of plant-based choices now available, customers are increasingly looking for options they know reflect vegan values, Mr. Ellis said. In response, Café Gratitude employees have again begun describing the restaurant as vegan, and there have been discussions about restoring the term in its branding.
"We feel like there's nothing to be lost by trying to regain that confidence in the vegan community," Mr. Ellis said. "It's us reclaiming what is rightfully ours."
The implications of a plant-based diet
Thomas Colin Campbell, the Cornell University biochemist who claims responsibility for coining the term plant-based, said he came up with the phrase to help present his research on diet to skeptical colleagues at the National Institutes of Health in 1980.
"I wanted to emphasize that my work and ideas were coming totally from science and not any sort of ethical or philosophical consideration," he said.
Mr. Campbell now advocates a "whole food plant-based diet," which he termed to draw a distinction between more nutritious whole plants and processed food products such as veggie burgers. He said he's noticed the term catch on since the release of the 2016 edition of his book "The China Study," which summarized his findings from a survey of 6,500 Chinese people on their eating and other lifestyle habits. The study's results suggested that following a plant-based diet may help reduce the risk of certain cancers and diseases.
But not everyone thinks eating only plants is always healthy. "Anytime you're restricting a whole food group or number of food groups, it's a red flag for a possible disordered eating mentality," said Vandana Sheth, a registered dietitian and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. "That's not always the case, but it's important to figure out how to get all the nutrients you need to prevent chronic conditions within your diet choice."
"The Game Changers," a documentary released on Netflix in 2019 about plant-based diets and athletic performance, has both broadened the appeal of plant-based diets and drawn criticism for some of its health claims.
According to Joseph Pace, a producer and writer on the film, the vegan and vegetarian movements carry connotations of New Agey-types or PETA activists, which don't always resonate with male viewers.
"Using 'plant-based' allows people to feel they're not joining a specific group for eating a specific way," he said.
Mr. Campbell sees the plant-based concept as a way to educate people on the environmental consequences of eating meat. A recent report from the World Resources Institute pointed to raising livestock as a significant source of carbon emissions and recommended reducing meat consumption as a way to combat climate change and stem deforestation.
"The environmental issue is a big one, and this plant-based phraseology works well when you think about it in a broader context," he said.
The trouble with labels
Yovana Mendoza Ayres, the vlogger formerly known as Rawvana, was a star of the expansive world of vegan YouTube -- until she was caught eating fish in another YouTuber's video earlier this year.
The backlash was swift. "Fishgate," as the ensuing controversy was dubbed, triggered a deluge of outraged comments and videos chastising the 30-year-old influencer for misleading her followers.
Some disgruntled fans flooded her social media pages with taunting fish emojis and GIFs. Others made death threats, which Ms. Ayres said she continues to receive.
"Just like how the vegan community welcomed me, when this came out, I became their enemy," she said.
In an apology video titled "THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING," Ms. Ayres said she began eating meat after experiencing a variety of health problems including a gastrointestinal disorder and the loss of her period, which occurred after completing a 25-day water cleanse during which she consumed nothing but water. In an interview, she added that she had planned to tell her followers about giving up her raw vegan diet but "didn't want other people's opinions to affect my transition."
In the months since her public apology, a half-dozen popular influencers have roiled the vegan internet by renouncing veganism after claiming to have experienced health complications caused by their diet. Ms. Ayres, who now goes by her first name online, said that as she and other vloggers have left veganism behind, she's noticed more discussion about what it means to be vegan as opposed to eating a plant-based diet.
"A lot of us used the word 'vegan' because that was a way of communicating that we ate only plants," she said. "Maybe after seeing us, people are learning not to put labels on themselves or on their diet," she added.

Texto completo: Readers offer their suggestions for how to revamp the primary process, in response to a column by David Leonhardt.
To the Editor:
Re "The Primary Process Makes No Sense" (column, Dec. 30):
David Leonhardt has excellent recommendations for improving the nomination process. Ranked-choice voting is essential. In any multiple-candidate primary or caucus anyone edging up to 30 percent can be declared the "winner." This revised method would ensure a more broadly accepted candidate would succeed. The winner-take-all primaries should be revised to allocate delegates based on popular vote totals.
Debates with a stage-spanning assembly of contenders should be replaced by "town hall" settings where each candidate is individually interviewed by a panel of journalists.
A series of five regional primaries, spread from February to June with rotation of order every four years, should replace the mishmash of the current system.
The nominee should be the people's choice, not the survivor of a jumbled process.
Dan Donovan

To the Editor:
David Leonhardt's column points out certain aspects of the primary system that make no sense and resulted in Donald Trump's nomination. But the solutions he suggests are complex and impractical. The core of the problem with the primary system is the low level of turnout. This results in a small minority, usually the most extreme of each party, having disproportionate influence.
Perhaps ranked-choice voting would help. Absent that, I suggest that primaries should be governed by the quorum requirement common in many government bodies in order for the results to be recognized. Even a quorum requirement of 30 percent or 40 percent of eligible voters participating would be a vast improvement.
Facilitating early voting, absentee voting and keeping the polls open for longer periods, including weekends, would make the achievement of a quorum more easily attainable and would make the results more representative.
Martin Nussbaum
New York
To the Editor:
David Leonhardt is right to criticize the current primary system for selection of candidates, but partisanship itself is the problem.
I envision an open primary system, in which all voters can vote for candidates of any party. This would orient the candidates to the broad center of the electorate, rather than to the activist fringes of each party. The field would be winnowed in a series of nationwide primaries, so that no states are favored or ignored. In each round, candidates would need to receive a higher percentage of the vote to proceed to the next round, ending with two candidates for the general election.
Such a system would invert the hyperpartisan system and would engage the whole nation, not just the battleground states.
Ron Meyers
New York
To the Editor:
It is critical that the Democratic debates address process issues like this. While it is useful to know the candidates' positions on health care, etc., it is just as important to figure out how Donald Trump has been able to run amok with the presidency.
What in our political system allowed him to get elected, and what has allowed him to misuse the presidency to such an extent? What changes should be made to prevent this? As Donald Trump has said, "I have an Article II where I have the right to do whatever I want as president." He has gone further in that direction than anyone before him.

Texto completo: Promoting women in these roles does not mean that we should denigrate the men in them, a reader says.
To the Editor:
As a former Stanford student athlete and now a faculty athletic representative at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I read "A Women's Sport, Ruled by Male Coaches" (news article, Dec. 20) with great interest.
It is not surprising that a male coach "fumbled to answer the question" of why there are not more women in top coaching jobs. Anyone would, as the answer requires an explanation of longstanding gender inequality in this country that transcends athletics and defies justification, a complexity my colleagues and I explored in our recent JAMA Internal Medicine commentary.
As a former Division 1 student athlete coached by a man I consider one of my greatest role models and mentors, I think it is really important not to assume that the way to promote women in these roles is to diminish the accomplishments or legitimacy of male coaches.
An N.C.A.A. president once predicted that Title IX "could seriously damage if not destroy the major men's intercollegiate athletic programs." Instead, more than 40 years later, collegiate men and women both achieve at the highest levels.
Likewise, promoting gender equity and diversity in coaching through mentorship, role modeling, sponsorship and opportunity should raise the bar for everyone.

Term Over, Mayor Pete Is No Longer A Mayor

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg rose to prominence, and viability as a presidential candidate, as the mayor of South Bend, Ind. Now that tenure has ended.
"Mayor Pete" is, technically, no longer Mayor Pete.
Pete Buttigieg's eight years in office in South Bend, Ind., ended on New Year's Day, when a new mayor was sworn in. Mr. Buttigieg, known colloquially as Mayor Pete almost since the start of his campaign last January, joined the ranks of former office holders seeking the presidency, who sometimes seem to hope that voters don't quite notice they have slipped from power.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to cite one example, is not a former anything to his staff. In a heads-up to reporters last week, the Biden campaign advised that "Vice President Biden will attend a community event in Derry, New Hampshire."
Stylebooks may advise newsrooms to use "former" before titles of politicians out of office, but said former office holders can be touchy about giving up the aura of power and prestige -- and it has become common political courtesy, regardless, to refer to them by the titles they once held.
In an "exit interview" on Tuesday with a South Bend TV station, WNDU, Mr. Buttigieg professed to be "reluctant to hand over the keys" to his office, "just because I love the job so much." His mayoral chief of staff, Laura O'Sullivan, posted a picture of him at his desk in the County-City Building at 10:42 p.m. on New Year's Eve, dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and blue tie, captioned "final quiet moments."
Mr. Buttigieg, who turns 38 on Jan. 19, has the rare distinction of being a presidential candidate whose day job ended in the heat of his national candidacy. He leaves the stewardship of the city, where he grew up, as a household name -- though a name even locals sometimes stumble over. Is it "Buddha-judge," as most in South Bend seem to say, or, as the presidential campaign mnemonic has it, "Boot Edge Edge"?
One thing for sure: The candidate will no longer be able to say, "Mayor Pete is fine."
Elected mayor when he was 29, Mr. Buttigieg announced in December 2018 that he would not seek a third term. He jumped into the presidential race one month later. Year-end fund-raising figures his campaign announced on Wednesday reported a door-busting $ 24.7 million haul in the final quarter, and more than $ 76 million for the year.
"We started out as an exploratory committee with four people in a little office," Mr. Buttigieg reminisced about his presidential start in the exit interview on Tuesday. "We had no money, not much of a mailing list even."
Mr. Buttigieg may have left office, but his mayoral tenure will hardly recede. As he heads into Iowa and New Hampshire voting next month as a leading candidate, his record is drawing strafing fire from opponents who question his experience and results.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in November that a woman who was mayor of a city as small as South Bend would not have been taken seriously enough to make the debate stage. A Black Lives Matter group in South Bend has called a news conference for Saturday to highlight what it calls Mr. Buttigieg's "tolerance for racism by police," intending to keep alive an issue that has apparently dampened Mr. Buttigieg's appeal to black voters nationally.
Mr. Buttigieg's last official act was to attend the swearing-in of his successor, James Mueller, at the Century Center convention hall on the Saint Joseph River downtown. The former mayor entered with his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, and his mother, Jennifer Anne Montgomery, a former professor at the University of Notre Dame.
Mr. Mueller, a childhood friend who returned home from Washington to work as Mr. Buttigieg's chief of staff, was his handpicked successor. Little known before he ran, he bested a Democratic primary field featuring nine candidates, then cruised into office in November. As the new mayor was introduced, Mr. Buttigieg's husband placed a hand on the former mayor's shoulder, who shot Mr. Mueller a broad smile.
"When I was growing up, success was synonymous with getting out," Mr. Mueller said. "On behalf of our city, I thank my predecessor, Mayor Pete, for leading us through our comeback decade."
Mr. Buttigieg did not speak formally. He planned to return to campaigning on Thursday with seven stops in New Hampshire through the week. In the exit interview he said his house on the river in South Bend was not for sale.

Pentagon warns against at-home DNA tests

Texto completo: In an internal memo, Pentagon leadership has urged military personnel not to take mail-in DNA tests, warning that they create security risks, are unreliable and could negatively affect service members' careers.
The letter, which was reported by Yahoo News, was sent last week. It does not name any particular DNA testing companies, but counsels broadly against buying ancestry and health tests promoted with military discounts and other military incentives.
Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the memo had been sent.
"We want to ensure all service members are aware of the risks of Direct to Consumer (DTC) genetic testing," he told The New York Times over email.
Over the past decade, millions of Americans have purchased DNA tests through companies such as 23andMe and Ancestry with the hopes of connecting with relatives, finding out more about their family origins and learning about how their DNA could affect their chances of developing certain health conditions.
Robertson said that the tests might provide inaccurate results and have negative professional consequences. "The unintentional discovery of markers that may affect readiness could affect a service member's career," he said.
The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act - known as GINA - prohibits discrimination by health insurers and employers based on the information that people carry in their genes. It does not apply to members of the military, however.
The memo was written by Joseph Kernan, the undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and James Stewart, the assistant secretary of defense for manpower. They warn that the tests "could expose personal and genetic information, and potentially create unintended security consequences."
In a statement, a spokeswoman from 23andMe said that the company took great care to protect customers' privacy. An Ancestry spokeswoman said that the company had not targeted military personnel with discounts.

Mitch McConnell (Ky.), will agree to a full and fair trial of the House's charges against President Trump. Whatever else may be said about the speaker's move, and however long her holdout lasts, it has certainly taken advantage of some inevitable holiday-season downtime to focus attention on the Senate's role in the process. So far, that has meant much-needed discussion of Mr. McConnell's obvious " and obviously political " intention to go through the motions of a trial on the way to an acquittal.
Now fresh reporting from the New York Times has emerged to strengthen the Democrats' minimum condition of a real trial: The Senate must seek witness testimony from key players in Mr. Trump's attempt to strong-arm Ukraine into announcing an investigation of his political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, using congressionally appropriated military aid and promises of a White House visit as leverage. The Times reports, based in part on previously undisclosed emails, that acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney tried to freeze the military aid on Mr. Trump's behalf as early as June, prompting puzzlement and backlash within the administration " to the extent that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and then-national security adviser John Bolton convened a White House meeting with Mr. Trump to urge release of the aid. Mr. Trump, apparently fixated on the idea that Ukraine had tried to defeat him in 2016, balked, asserting, contrary to Defense Department certifications, that Ukraine was hopelessly corrupt.
More than ever, therefore, the Senate and the public need to hear from Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton, the latter of whom made an unsuccessful individual plea to release the Ukraine aid on Aug. 16, according to the Times. Their testimony, and that of Mr. Mulvaney's top aide, Robert B. Blair, and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey, has always been crucial, which is why House impeachment investigators initially sought it and " undoubtedly " why the White House refused to allow it.
Certainly, the House's demand that the Senate call these witnesses is undercut to some extent by its own failure to persist in trying to compel their testimony, hoping to avoid getting bogged down in an extended court fight with the administration. Yet the question of whether the Senate should exercise its subpoena power to obtain relevant testimony is a separate issue, politically, legally and morally. A Senate leader sincerely interested in operating as head of an independent branch of government would have left no doubt that he intended to do so. Mr. McConnell has done the opposite, giving rise to Ms. Pelosi's very legitimate concerns.

Texto completo: Mike Bloomberg was presiding over his inaugural Bloomberg New Economy Forum in Singapore in 2018 when, to the surprise of some in the audience, he gushed about one of China's top government officials.
Vice President Wang Qishan was 'the most influential political figure in China and in the world,' Bloomberg said, breaking from a prepared text that had said the keynote speaker was 'one of' the most influential. Bloomberg noted that he and Wang had first met at Bloomberg's home 15 years earlier, when he was mayor of New York and Wang was mayor of Beijing, and he praised the vice president for helping lead China 'through a period of extraordinary growth.'
Then in September, amid mass pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and human rights activists decrying China's imprisonment of Muslim minorities, Bloomberg seemed to go out of his way to defend Beijing, saying in a television interview that President Xi Jinping 'is not a dictator.' Bloomberg said Xi 'has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.' Pressed by the interviewer, Bloomberg said Xi 'has a constituency to respond to . . . they really are responsive.'
If President Trump's unprecedented decision to retain ownership of his global real estate business has tested the limits of America's ethics laws and traditions, sparking lawsuits and allegations of influence by foreign interests, a Bloomberg presidency could present a whole new level of overseas entanglements " with China as a prime example.
Tensions have grown between Washington and Beijing in recent years amid trade disputes, clashes over democracy and human rights, and disagreements over China's efforts to expand its influence around the world. Yet Bloomberg, who is spending tens of millions of dollars of his own money to compete for the Democratic presidential nomination, has deepened his entanglements with that key U.S. adversary " forging close financial ties there while showering praise on the Communist Party leaders whose goodwill is required to play a role in that fast-growing market.
The billionaire, whose core business sells financial information to investors, has led efforts since 2015 to make it easier for U.S. companies to trade in Chinese currency, a move embraced by China's largest banks. He expanded one of his company's financial indexes, which could steer $150 billion into China while earning his firm an undisclosed amount in fees.
All told, mainland China accounts for 1 percent of Bloomberg LP's revenue and Hong Kong for another 4 percent. Overall, Bloomberg LP's $10 billion in annual revenue far surpasses that of the Trump Organization, which was at least $435 million in 2018, according to Trump's financial disclosure.
Trump's ownership of hotels, including one near the White House, has been challenged as a violation of a constitutional provision that forbids a president from taking payments from foreign governments. Bloomberg's business is far broader, interwoven into the financial fabric throughout the world.
While Bloomberg has stepped aside from running his privately held company as he runs for president, he has maintained his 88 percent ownership stake. If elected, a spokesman said, Bloomberg would either put the company in a blind trust or sell it. It is not clear whether putting his business in a blind trust would negate questions about a conflict of interest because Bloomberg would know the main asset of the trust is his company.

If Bloomberg were elected president, he would immediately have to deal with the same Chinese officials he worked with closely as the chief executive of his business " but in his new role, he would be embroiled in the trade war and face questions about how to deal with China's human rights violations and its handling of pro-democracy protesters.
Kyle Bass, a hedge fund manager whose past investments once included a bet that Chinese currency would fall in value, said voters inevitably will ask whether Bloomberg feels beholden to China.
The Chinese government, Bass said, 'has enormous financial leverage over anyone who does business with them, and so when Mike Bloomberg does interviews and says Xi is not a dictator, I believe Mike Bloomberg is blinded by his wallet.'
Bass stressed that he believes Bloomberg is the 'most capable' of all the presidential candidates but said 'his biggest weakness and biggest vulnerability is on China.'
'It is a problem for a president, a public official, to continue to own business interests in countries that have been designated by the U.S. government as a strategic competitor,' said Andrew J. Nathan, a China specialist and professor of political science at Columbia University.
Bloomberg declined an interview request. His spokesman, Jason Schechter, said in a written response to questions that, 'As President, Mike will speak up about areas where we have profound differences with China, including on human rights, democratic freedoms and trade.' Schechter said Bloomberg supports sanctions against China in response to 'gross violations of human rights against the Uighurs.'
In addition, Schechter said Bloomberg believes that 'the Chinese have taken advantage of the global trading system' in ways that hurt U.S. workers and that, as president, he would 'address those problems.' The spokesman said Bloomberg would work cooperatively with China on issues of mutual concern such as climate change, adding that Bloomberg 'will always say and do what he thinks is right for America, regardless of the impact on his business.'
A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry declined to discuss Bloomberg, saying, 'China will not comment on specific individuals, enterprises or relevant business activities,' while adding that the country welcomed 'all endeavors that contribute to China-U.S. friendship and cooperation.'

Ninth-richest person Bloomberg is one of the world's richest people, although that would not be known by examining the 500-person Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The company's policy is not to cover itself, so Bloomberg himself 'isn't considered for this ranking,' the company says in a note about its methodology. Forbes magazine says Bloomberg is the world's ninth-richest person, with a net worth of $55.5 billion.
Bloomberg's wealth is partly derived from his company's expansion far beyond its New York City roots. Bloomberg's company opened offices in Beijing 25 years ago, selling its computer terminal and financial information subscriptions. Bloomberg has long held the view that a 'growing Chinese economy is good for America,' as he wrote in a 2008 article in Newsweek. Bloomberg said that 'we have a stake in working together to solve common problems, rather than trying to browbeat or intimidate the other into action.'
As Bloomberg has urged cooperation with China, questions have been raised about whether his news service has held back from publishing information that would offend the Chinese leadership, because of concern that the government would expel his employees.
At first, the company was praised for its willingness to produce tough reporting about the Chinese leadership. It won a prestigious Polk Award for its 2012 article about the family finances of Xi, who was then vice president. The company's terminal sales in China declined, and the government imposed restrictions on Bloomberg News employees. Bloomberg's website was blocked from being viewed in mainland China.
But the following year, after Xi was elevated to the presidency, a follow-up investigation was not published. The New York Times reported at the time that Bloomberg's editors had refused to release the story as written because it would offend the Chinese leadership.
A Bloomberg manager was quoted as telling members of the Hong Kong bureau, 'If we run the story, we'll be kicked out of China.' A Bloomberg reporter suspected of leaking the information was suspended and left the company, joining the New York Times.
Bloomberg, who was then mayor of New York City, stressed at the time that he was not running Bloomberg LP and that his assets were in a blind trust. Still, he said Bloomberg's editors had assured him they had not censored the information.
After returning to run the company in 2014, Bloomberg was asked by CNBC whether his news service had 'muzzled' reporters. He responded: 'In China, they have rules about what you can publish. We follow those rules. If you don't follow the rules, you're not in the country.'

Since then, Bloomberg has spent many hours with China's leaders and the relationship has blossomed. While the company's website is still blocked in China, as are other American media sites including The Washington Post's, it is allowed to sell its terminals and subscription service and has expanded its operations in the country. About 200 of Bloomberg LP's 20,000 employees work in mainland China and another 800 work in Hong Kong, the company says.
But the company's presence in China is invaluable in ways that don't show up in a balance sheet, enabling Bloomberg to provide economic data that is crucial for many subscribers around the world.
Parag Khanna, founder of the strategic advisory firm FutureMap and author of the book 'The Future is Asian,' has written that Bloomberg's company is 'effectively the world's largest private intelligence service,' which is particularly notable in the relatively opaque Chinese marketplace.
Subscribers around the world rely on Bloomberg-generated information to help them decide where and how to invest capital " a trove that is vital to China's efforts to entice investment in the government's bonds.
To meet that need, Bloomberg's company in March 2018 announced that it would add 333 Chinese government bonds to its Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index. That opened the way for tens of billions of dollars to flow from investment funds in the United States and elsewhere to four Chinese institutions that issue bonds, including the Chinese government and the China Development Bank.
It was a breakthrough achievement for Bloomberg LP " and China. Bloomberg's company earns a licensing fee when investment firms use the index as the basis for their financial products. A Bloomberg spokesman declined to say how much revenue the company expects to collect in such fees.
By some estimates, investors are expected to pour some $150-billion into the Chinese bonds in the next couple of years. As a result, while Trump's tariffs are taking effect, Bloomberg's company is helping the Chinese economy, analysts said.
'Companies that control financial capital " pension funds and other asset managers " are the investors who have Bloomberg terminals and represent trillions of dollars of savings looking for high returns,' Khanna said. 'Those are the investors that China is courting as it further opens its capital account to foreigners.'
David Tabaka, who analyzes global indexes for Burton-Taylor International Consulting, said the money flowing into China as a result of the index 'is very important' to the country's leaders. 'It's a net positive for them,' he said.
But the inclusion of Chinese bonds in the index has been criticized by those who object to the use of funds that may originate in the United States to support the communist country.
Bloomberg personally trumpeted the inclusion of Chinese bonds in the index, saying in a 2018 news release that it would 'enhance access to the world's third-largest bond market' and is 'a testament to China's firm commitment to financial reforms.'
Similarly, Bloomberg has devoted himself to making it easier for U.S. companies to do business in Chinese currency, chairing the Working Group on U.S. RMB Trading and Clearing, which includes many of the largest banks in the United States and China. He has cited the group's work as evidence that China is opening its markets.

Opposes tariffs Bloomberg's effort to influence U.S.-China policy has been particularly evident on trade issues, making him one of the most vocal U.S. business leaders opposing tariffs on China's exports. Bloomberg came to Washington in 2018 to announce that he would lead an effort against trade policies that he said would hurt the U.S. economy as well as 'strain ties with nations around the world, including China, and we can't let that happen.'
That put him sharply at odds with the efforts of Trump, who in September 2019 boasted that he had approved tariffs on more than $500 billion worth of Chinese goods in an effort to get the country to negotiate. (Trump recently announced the terms of a partial trade deal with China in which he canceled tariffs on $160-billion of those goods, halved tariffs on another $120-billion and left in place a 25 percent tariff on another $250 billion.)
Bloomberg also strengthened his ties to China in 2018 when he launched the inaugural meeting of the Bloomberg New Economy Forum. He envisioned it as similar to the World Economic Forum held annually in Davos, Switzerland. Bloomberg's forum, he said at the time, would focus on 'China as an emerging power and how we all work together.'
The first forum was slated to be held in Beijing, but the U.S.-China trade war, as well as an overlap with a separate economic meeting, necessitated that it be moved to Singapore. Some 400 business and political leaders were invited, with the keynote delivered by Wang, China's vice president.
The event was considered a success by China, and in 2019, it was held in Beijing. Bloomberg was slated to oversee it once again, but he did not attend because it conflicted with his announcement that he was running for president.
Now that Bloomberg is a candidate, his decades of work in China and relationship with the Chinese leadership are drawing unprecedented scrutiny at a time of continuing tensions between the countries with the world's two largest economies.
Among those awaiting an explanation for his statement that Xi is not a dictator are advocates for Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities who have been forced into internment camps and other facilities in the Xinjiang region.
'Mr. Bloomberg is completely wrong in saying that Mr. Xi is not a dictator and completely wrong in saying he is responsive,' said Louisa Greve, director of global advocacy for the Uyghur Human Rights Project, which estimates that 2 million to 3 million members of the ethnic group have been 'detained or disappeared.'
Greve said that a series of Chinese moves, such as a measure adopted that enables Xi to be president for life, are classic signs of a dictatorship.
Some China experts said Bloomberg's declaration that Xi is not a dictator stems from his understanding that the Chinese government works through various layers of committees and not by one person's edict.
'When he is talking about how China works and not a dictatorship, I think he is just observing what he has seen over the years and throwing it out there without sucking up to the Chinese leadership,' said Peter Walker, author of 'Powerful, Different, Equal: Overcoming the Misconceptions and Differences Between China and the U.S.'
'It is pretty gutsy of him, saying something positive or even neutral about China,' Walker said. 'There are a lot of people who don't want to hear that story. It is one that is so counter to the belief that the American model is the best model there is.'

The uproar surrounding a Star Wars casualty

Texto completo: Since 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker' opened last month, many fans have been riled by the film's diminution of the character Rose Tico, played by Kelly Marie Tran. Rose was a prominent mechanic-turned-hero in the previous movie, 'The Last Jedi,' but gets barely more than a minute of screen time in 'Rise.'
Her near-erasure sparked the hashtag #RoseTicoDeservedBetter , which led 'Crazy Rich Asians' director Jon M. Chu to tweet an offer to guide a would-be Disney Plus series featuring Tran's character, who was the first lead woman of color in a Star Wars movie.
Now, a series of statements by Chris Terrio, who co-wrote 'Rise' with director J.J. Abrams, is illuminating the behind-the-scenes thinking to a degree " yet also further rousing some fans of Rose, who was embraced as a major step forward for representation.
Tran left Instagram last year after she was subject to an online bullying campaign, with some of the abusive remarks commenting on her looks and ethnicity. 'Their words reinforced a narrative I had heard my whole life: that I was 'other,' that I didn't belong, that I wasn't good enough, simply because I wasn't like them,' Tran wrote last year in a personal essay in the New York Times.
Terrio told Awards Daily last week that there was nothing deliberate or nefarious in pushing Rose aside. He said the character was originally set to share several scenes with Leia Organa, in a posthumous 'performance' by Carrie Fisher, cobbled together from footage shot before her death.
'One of the reasons that Rose has a few less scenes than we would like her to have has to do with the difficulty of using Carrie's footage in the way we wanted to,' said Terrio, emphasizing that he and Abrams 'adore' Tran. 'We wanted Rose to be the anchor at the rebel base who was with Leia.'
'A few scenes we'd written with Rose and Leia turned out to not meet the standard of photorealism that we'd hoped for,' Terrio added. 'Those scenes unfortunately fell out of the film. The last thing we were doing was deliberately trying to sideline Rose.'
On Monday, Terrio walked back that explanation, saying that the real issue with Rose had nothing to do with visual effects.
In a statement, he told Vulture: 'I badly misspoke if in an earlier statement I implied that any cut scenes between Rose and Leia were the fault of our VFX team and the wizards at ILM. In that earlier interview, I was referring to a specific scene in which Leia's emotional state in 'Episode VII' ['The Force Awakens'] did not seem to match the scene we wrote for use in 'Episode IX' ['Rise'] and so it was cut at the script stage before the VFX work was done.'
Terrio underscored to the Hollywood Reporter on Monday that the issue did not involve 'photorealism,' as he earlier stated. 'I would sometimes come and sit at the VFX reviews and my jaw would drop at seeing Leia live again."
(Representatives from the film have not yet responded to a request from The Post to speak with Terrio.)
Terrio's comments have renewed criticism of how Rose was sidelined. Critic and podcaster Amy Nicholson tweeted Monday: 'Carrie Fisher passed away 9 months before Chris Terrio and JJ were hired to write STAR WARS. Do they . . . not think we can fact check nonsense about being forced to scrap scenes they wrote for Leia and Rose?'
Even before this controversy, some fans viewed 'Rise' as Abrams's attempt at course correction after Rian Johnson's 'The Last Jedi,' which divided fans over many of its story choices, such as the heroic Rey seemingly being of humble lineage, and the ultimate fate of Luke Skywalker. Some Star Wars fans also interpreted Abrams's comments in a recent New York Times article as criticism of 'Last Jedi.' Abrams said in part that the trilogy 'needed a pendulum swing in one direction in order to swing in the other.'
Despite the sidelining of Rose, Terrio tried to spin her presence as a positive, telling the Hollywood Reporter, 'Rose begins her journey in TLJ ['The Last Jedi'] as just about the lowest person on the Resistance totem pole. In TROS ['The Rise of Skywalker'], Rose is at the right hand of the general, working on military plans and helping to call the shots.'

Texto completo: BAGHDAD — Protesters broke into the heavily guarded compound of the US Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday and set fires inside in anger over US airstrikes that killed 24 members of an Iranian-backed militia over the weekend.
The men did not enter the main embassy buildings and later withdrew from the compound, joining thousands of protesters and militia fighters outside chanting “Death to America," throwing rocks, covering the walls with graffiti, and demanding that the United States withdraw its forces from Iraq.
The situation remained combustible, with the crowd vowing to camp indefinitely outside the sprawling compound, the world's largest embassy. Their ability to storm the most heavily guarded zone in Baghdad suggested that they had received at least tacit permission from Iraqi security officials sympathetic to their demands.
President Trump, faced with scenes of unfolding chaos at a US embassy, lashed out against Iran, which he blamed for the protests.
“Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities," he said in a tweet. “They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!"
He spoke with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi about the need to protect Americans and US facilities, a White House statement said.
Roughly 750 additional US troops will deploy to the region immediately, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said late Tuesday. “This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against US personnel and facilities," he said. The troops are likely to deploy to Kuwait.
Those soldiers are in addition to 14,000 US troops who have deployed to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression, including its alleged sabotage of commercial shipping in the Persian Gulf.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also spoke by telephone with Abdul-Mahdi and President Barham Salih in separate calls, and “made clear the United States will protect and defend its people," according to a summary of the call from the State Department. It said that the Iraqi leaders “assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility" to safeguard American officials and property.
The State Department said that US personnel were safe and that there were no plans to evacuate the embassy. The ambassador, Matt Tueller, had been traveling and was not at the embassy when it was breached Tuesday.
The US airstrikes Sunday have resulted in the most serious political crisis in years for the United States in Iraq, stoking anti-Americanism and handing an advantage to Iran in its competition for influence in the country.
The airstrikes targeted an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, Kataib Hezbollah, which the United States accused of carrying out a missile attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor and wounded US and Iraqi service members. A spokesman for the militia denied involvement in the attack.
But the size of the US response — five strikes in Iraq and Syria that killed two dozen fighters and wounded dozens of others — prompted condemnation from across the political spectrum in Iraq and accusations that the United States had violated Iraqi sovereignty. It also drew sharp criticism and serious threats of reprisals from Iraq's Iranian-backed militias.
The fact that the Iraqi government permitted militia members to enter the fortified Green Zone on Tuesday, allowing the protest to happen, demonstrated Iran's powerful influence as well as the government's difficulty in controlling the militias.
But the Iraqi leadership's success in averting a deeper incursion into the embassy compound and preventing any confrontation with US personnel suggested that the government may have intended to allow the militias to vent their anger with minimal damage.
The US military made a show of force in response to the turmoil, with helicopter gunships circling overhead. From inside the compound, loudspeakers warned the crowd outside to keep away.
The Pentagon sent 120 Marine reinforcements to Baghdad from Kuwait, roughly the same number sent to the embassy in 2014, when the Islamic State was threatening Baghdad.
The protest began Tuesday morning when thousands of militia members gathered outside the Green Zone after prayer services for the fighters killed in the US strikes.
While few of them were armed, many were members of Kataib Hezbollah and other fighting groups that are technically overseen by the Iraqi military. Kataib Hezbollah is separate from the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon, although both groups are backed by Iran and oppose the United States.
When the protesters pushed toward the entrance to the Green Zone, a heavily guarded district of government offices and embassies in central Baghdad, the Iraqi security forces did not stop them.
Their accession to the protesters was a marked contrast to their treatment of the antigovernment protesters who have been demonstrating outside the Green Zone for months. Those protesters were met with tear gas and bullets and have not been able to enter the Green Zone.
Once at the US Embassy, the protesters on Tuesday used long poles to shatter security cameras. They covered the compound walls with anti-American graffiti and set a guardhouse on fire.
After breaking open a compound entrance, dozens of men entered and lit more fires while embassy security guards watched them from the embassy roof and fired tear gas.
One group of protesters ended up separated from US troops by only a pane of glass, according to a video shared on social media. It was not immediately clear how many Americans were inside the compound.
The embassy complex, which opened in 2009 and cost an estimated $736 million to build, covers 104 acres, nearly as big as Vatican City, the world's smallest country.
The embassy and an American consulate in Irbil, in northern Iraq, now have a combined staff of 486 people, with the majority in Baghdad.
The scenes there Tuesday stirred memories of the seizure of two searing, politically consequential events in recent US history: the seizure of the embassy and 52 hostages in Tehran during the Islamic Revolution in 1979, and the assault on a US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.
As a congressman, Pompeo became a political star among Republicans for blistering criticism of Hillary Clinton, then the secretary of state, over the Benghazi attack.
Trump also had Benghazi in mind, calling the Baghdad attack “the anti-Benghazi."
The protesters eventually left the Baghdad compound, but some climbed on top of adjacent buildings, where they planted militia flags. Iraqi police and military personnel eventually arrived at the scene, but they did not disperse the protesters.
While the protesters carried the flags of Iraq and a range of militia groups, the most prominent was that of Kataib Hezbollah, the group targeted by the United States.
A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, Mohammed Muhi, said his group intended to erect tents in the street in front of the US Embassy for an opened-ended sit-in to pressure the Americans to leave Iraq.
About 1,000 militia members remained camped out in front of the embassy overnight.

May 5,2018 was the bicentennial of the birth of Karl Marx. There were commemorative events held worldwide. Throughout 2018 there was a renewed interest in Marx's theory of scientific socialism and his critique of capitalism.
Now, suppose the University of California-Berkley released a study to coincide with Marx's bicentennial celebration, and the study detailed the long-term effects of capitalist exploitation on marginalized workforces across America. Suppose, the study compared the material, mental, and physical well-being of the marginalized to the majority population and concluded that capitalist exploitation contributed to disparities in wealth, depression, and substance abuse, which correlated to disparities in infant mortality rates and shortened the life expectancy of the marginalized. Then, based on the data, 20 American city councils, whose economies have historically suffered from deindustrialization, decided to declare capitalism a health crisis in an effort to start a national conversation about America's fractured market economy.
A lot of people would be sympathetic to the sentiment, but they wouldn't take it as a serious course of action.
Now, 2019 had its own historical significance. It was the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Africans to the Jamestown colony in 1619. The New York Times Magazine published, the 1619 Project, a collection of essays examining the lingering effects of slavery in modern America.
In June, Milwaukee County officials declared racism a public health crisis. Inequality.org reported, "Milwaukee is one of the most racially unequal cities in the county, coming in at No. 2 last year on a list of 'The worst cities for Black Americans' by 24/7 Wall Street, a financial news site. The report blamed Milwaukee's discriminatory housing policies throughout the 20th century for the city's current inequity ...By declaring racism, a public health crisis, Milwaukee County officials are committing to put racial equity at the core of all city procedures, to advocate for policies that improve health in communities of color, and to train their employees on how racism impacts residents...Finally, they hope to encourage other local, state, and national officials to recognize racism as a public health issue."
Milwaukee County officials were encouraging. In August, Ronnie Dunn, associate professor of urban affairs at Cleveland State University, created Project 400. Throughout the year Project 400 held a conference, a Call to Action Summit titled 400 Years of Inequality, and an arts festival. The Call to Action Summit examined the notion of racism as a public health crisis. Dunn said, "Structural racism is not going to be eradicated in our lifetime, but this is the appropriate time to make a concerted effort to have the important conversations."
In the same month, Kansas City Councilwoman Melissa Robinson drafted a resolution to declare racism a public health crisis due to the disparities in life expectancy between Black men and White women. The resolution had two objectives. 1). To start a conversation about the impact of racism on public health. 2). Establish a comprehensive plan to address inequalities that leave Black men vulnerable to early deaths.
In October, Madison's city council signed on to Wisconsin Public Health Association's resolution declaring racism a public health crisis. According to WPHA there has been growing recognition that racism independently impacts health outcomes.
In December, Pittsburgh's city council declared racism a public health crisis. Their decision was based on a study done by the University of Pittsburgh called Pittsburgh's Inequality Across Gender and Race. The study pointed out for every dollar White men earn, White women earn 78 cents, while Black women earn 54 cents, and Black women are five times more likely to live in poverty than are White men. White life expectancy is eight years longer than Blacks, and death rates from cardiovascular disease and cancer are much higher among Blacks.
Once again, a lot of people will be sympathetic to the sentiment, but...

Texto completo: I just finished reading an article in The New York Times on the alarming number of small and mid-size town newspapers across the country that are folding these days, including testimonies from local residents lamenting their absence: "Our Community Does Not Know Itself'" (Dec. 21.)
And I'm thinkin' that rather than dwelling on the Press Herald's shortcomings (few and far between as they might be), Portlanders (myself included) should be thankful that it's here at all, hangin' in. Better short comings, I say, than long gone.

While I agree Maine is uniquely challenged with an aging, geographically sparse population, I also have a hard time giving up on the community driven themes within my childhood. For example, just three days after Phillips' letter was published, I had my own issue. Doing some chainsaw work around the house, an ash tree snapped and knocked me out. If it weren't for Will Tierney and those of the Long Island Volunteer Fire and Rescue team, who found me at my property and transported me safely on the town boat to Maine Med, I wouldn't be here.
Yes, Colin Woodard's "People on the Front Lines" series on Maine's EMS is concerning. I harken back to what Eric Wellman said, "They [first responders] evaluate themselves and don't really want to work in a hospital or behind a desk, they want to be mobile and in an environment that's changing, same as people who are in the military and fire and police services."
Though hard for this Morse High School "Shipbuilder" to admit, even Brunswick High School sees the need and wants to fill the void and is training it's students to fill important jobs as certified nursing assistants and emergency medical technicians.
From Newfield to New Gloucester, Maine might see within itself the community it always was and could be again.

When I served as a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy, I learned that the Uniform Code of Military Justice includes an article that prohibits behavior unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and calls for the dismissal from the service of those convicted.
Is there any doubt that, as commander in chief, Donald Trump has engaged in behavior that is unbecoming an officer and a gentleman?

Back in the day, I remember the Nixon impeachment scenario, when people proclaimed his innocence and touted what a great guy he was. It was an argument against Nixon that I, at 23 years old, lost many times. People were too enamored of his perceived accomplishments to recognize any frailty.
In almost a dÃ©jÃ  vu moment, we are again facing an impeachment of a president considered by some to be above the law, not to be held accountable for infractions that he deems "minor." I remember Richard Nixon's demeanor and behavior. He did not earn the nickname "Tricky Dick" for being a party host and jokester. He was more Machiavelli and less humorist.
Trump's conduct and behavior make Nixon look saintly. His allegiance to Russia and Vladimir Putin is something far beyond Nixon's transgressions. It is as if Putin and company have powerful leverage over the most powerful leader in the world. Something is seriously rotten in the Trumpian "state" of Moscow.
Having witnessed the population's dismay at Nixon's impeachment and the aftermath, one wonders what will happen to the senators who stand ready to acquit Trump. Is their acquittal an acquiescence to Trump's behavior and a willingness to have five more years of Trump leading us down a dark rabbit hole?
Nixon, while similarly guilty of malfeasance, resigned. A Trump acquittal may mean it is time to buckle our seat belts and prepare to bow to King Donald. Personally, I am not a fan of bowing.

President Tump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18. To remove a president, two thirds of members of the Senate must vote for removal - highly unlikely in a Senate with 53 Republicans.
But before the trial can proceed, Senate members must vote on the rules which will govern the trial.
Based on impeachment history - President Clinton in the 20th century and President Johnson in the 19th century - the Senate majority leader negotiates the rules with leaders of Senate Republicans and Democrats. A majority of Senate members (51) must then approve these rules. Senate leader Mitch McConnell already stated he is not impartial - regardless of the impartiality oath he must take - and he does not intend to allow additional documents or witnesses to be introduced.
The evidence from the House impeachment hearings is one-sided because President Trump ordered members of his administration to disobey congressional subpoenas for witnesses and documents. Senate Democrats want to introduce administrative documents and witnesses not yet seen or heard. Even President Trump said he wants witnesses. How Senate members vote on these rules will determine whether or not there will be a full and fair trial. How will Sen. Collings vote on these rules?

Ruling in ACA case should be election issue

Texto completo: In ducking its opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of the entire Affordable Care Act, a federal appeals court has done a large favor for President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But it leaves millions of people in uncertainty and anxiety. It was unnecessary and unethical.
By sending the case back to the district judge in Texas who had ruled against Obamacare, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals virtually guaranteed that it won’t reach the Supreme Court in time for a final decision before the November election.
That lets Trump and his party off the hook, inviting them to duck the issue during the campaign, rather than level with the voters on how — or whether — they would replace what the courts might eventually throw out.
Make no mistake: Trump and the Republicans want the court to trash Obamacare, but not in time for the voters to hold it against them in November. And no matter the potentially drastic, even deadly, consequences for everyone who depends on its coverage.
That’s virtually everyone in America, not just the 11.4 million who obtained health insurance through the Obamacare marketplaces or the 13.6 million who were added to the Medicaid rolls in the 36 states and District of Columbia where, unlike Florida, human lives outweigh right-wing ideology.
The Affordable Care Act also guarantees private insurance coverage despite preexisting medical conditions such as diabetes, allows children to remain on parental health plans until they are 26, makes insurance companies return excess profits, forbids them from cancelling policies except for fraud, bars lifetime limits on benefits and requires large employers to offer insurance to their workers.
Trump put the federal government on the side of Florida and 16 other states, all controlled by Republicans, that joined with three individuals suing to have the entire law discarded.
Former Attorney General Pam Bondi, who now works for Trump, put Florida on the wrong side of that litigation. Her successor, Ashley Moody, keeps us there.
Moody owes it to the people to say how much or how little of Obamacare she would have her party replace if the courts eventually overturn it. Everyone running for office next year, from the president to the Congress to the state legislatures should also have their answers at the ready.
Health care topped all other issues in an exit poll of voters in the 2018 midterms, which returned the House to Democratic control, and is second in the current campaign only to Trump’s impeachment.
The Fifth Circuit’s decision is glaring in two respects.
— The trial judge, Reed O. Connor in the Northern District of Texas, had already declared all of Obamacare unconstitutional because Congress repealed the tax charged to people who did not obtain insurance. Upon upholding only that part of his decision, the appeals court sent it back to him to explain his reasoning about the rest. That was unnecessary — an act of judicial laziness if not worse.
— The 2-1 split in the panel illustrated the worsening politicization of the federal judiciary along ideological and partisan lines. The two judges in the majority owe their appointments to Presidents George W. Bush and Trump, and both are or have been members of the Federalist Society, the rigidly right-wing organization that has become the gatekeeper for judicial appointments under Trump.
The dissenter, Senior Judge Carolyn Dineen King, appointed by President Jimmy Carter, rebuked the Texas judge for accepting a case in which there was no real violation of anyone’s rights. Without the tax, she reasoned, the mandate was already unenforceable; Florida and the 16 other plaintiff states had nothing at stake at all. She would have overturned the district court’s order “because none of the plaintiffs have standing to challenge the coverage requirement.
“And although I would not reach the merits on remedial issues, if I did, I would conclude that the coverage requirement is constitutional, albeit unenforceable, and entirely severable from the remainder of the Affordable Care Act.”
Without the tax, she wrote, the law “does not do anything or bind anyone.” What was left of the coverage requirement “does nothing more than require individuals to pay zero dollars to the IRS if they do not purchase health insurance, which is to say it does nothing at all.”
She criticized her colleagues for not rejecting “textbook judicial overreach.”
Congress, she emphasized, had made its intent plain by repealing only the tax, not any of the other elements of the law that have proved popular.
Did some of those voting to repeal the tax have a deeper, sinister motive in mind? Were they trying to expose all of Obamacare to constitutional challenge?
Only they know. What they also should know is that the requirement they repealed has since been credited with saving some 700 lives.
That’s the estimate in a working paper by Treasury Department economists based on mortality rates and on the numbers of people who appeared to have purchased health insurance after the IRS told them they had been fined for not having it. The New York Times reported the story Dec. 10.
Last week, Florida Phoenix reported that an estimated 2,700 Floridians aged 55 to 64 died between 2014 and 2017 on account of Florida’s refusal to extend Medicaid to 500,000 people who are in the coverage gap between eligibility for Medicaid and Obamacare subsidies.
So it bears remembering that human lives are at stake in what might seem to be an arcane legal battle over federal jurisprudence.
Also, ours is the only industrialized democracy that does not regard health care as an inalienable human right.

Texto completo: A Greek chef who cooks Italian food is moving his restaurant this week into the former Anjon's Italian Restaurant at 521 Route 1 in Scarborough.
Anjon's, which served old-school Italian food in Maine for more than 60 years, closed in September.
Bob Rizk, the owner of Cobblestone Grille at 8 Heath St. in Old Orchard Beach, says he is leasing the building with an option to buy, and hopes to open Jan. 17.
Rizk will keep everything from Cobblestone Grille except the name, which will change to Amore on the Marsh. The menu and prices will remain the same, he said. But the move will at least quadruple his seating - Cobblestone Grill had just 50 seats, which meant customers often had to wait a half-hour or so for a table, Rizk said.
For now, Amore on the Marsh will be open for dinner Tuesday through Sunday. In the spring, the restaurant will be open every day and offer lunch as well.
'speakeasy barcade'
If all went well last night, the new owner of Pat's Pizza in Portland made good on his promise to open a speakeasy upstairs on New Year's Eve.
Mike Lizotte of Freeport, who also owns The Drink Exchange at 43 Wharf St., bought Pat's Pizza in August and said he planned to open something a little different upstairs - a speakeasy with a cassette tape-lined stairwell and telephone booth front door. Its grand opening was scheduled for Dec. 31. The new business at 32 Market St., called Pie North, is described as "the only Speakeasy Barcade in Maine," blending retro musical decor with classic arcade games.
'Restaurant: Impossible' 2.0
In 2014, Robert Irvine, host of the Food Network show "Restaurant: Impossible," which helps struggling restaurants get back on their feet, paid a visit to Uncle Andy's, a 65-year-old diner in South Portland's Knightville neighborhood.
On Sept. 14, Irvine and his crew returned to see how the diner and its owner, Dennis Fogg, are faring five years after its two-day, $10,000 makeover.
You can see Irvine's second impression of the diner when the Uncle Andy's return visit episode airs at 8 p.m. Thursday.

ered for a cup of coffee and a slice of pie for 68 years, is closing.
Calling it "a tough an emotional decision," owner Brad Pollard said the restaurant's last day will be Jan. 13.
The sprawling roadside restaurant at 64 Lewiston Road was founded in 1952 by two brothers. Originally a burger and ice cream stand, the 24-by-30-foot building that sprang up in a rocky pasture expanded to seat as many as 300 diners and employed thousands of locals over the years.

Texto completo: They’re famous for their films, TV shows and music — but sometimes celebrities make more headlines for the jaw-dropping, controversial or cringeworthy things they say.
Here are 10 times that Hollywood heavyweights put their foot in their mouth in 2019.
1. Kanye West’s sickening self-praise
No stranger to nonsensical rants and an inflated sense of self, the rapper who made the 2013 album called “Yeezus,” which included a song called “I Am a God,” was at it again in 2019. While joining televangelist Joel Osteen on stage at a Sunday church service in Houston in November, West proclaimed, “The greatest artist that God ever created is now working for Him.” Ye added, “I’m here in service to God. No weapon formed against me shall prosper.”
2. Barbra Streisand’s Michael Jackson misstep
Babs took a lot of heat after her tone-deaf comments about two men — Wade Robson and James Safechuck — accusing Michael Jackson of sexually assaulting them as children.
“His sexual needs were his sexual needs, coming from whatever childhood he has or whatever DNA he has,” Streisand told British newspaper The Times in a piece out last March. “You can say ‘molested,’ but those children, as you heard say (grown-up Robson and Safechuck), they were thrilled to be there. They both married and they both have children, so it didn’t kill them.”
3. Kelly Ripa’s cluelessness
As college students across the county struggle to pay tuition, the TV host — who boasts a reported net worth of $75 million — thought it would be funny to joke that her son Michael Consuelos was living in “poverty” now that he’s an NYU student and living in Brooklyn.
“He hates paying his own rent, and he is chronically poor,” Ripa said on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” in October. “I don’t think he ever really experienced, you know, extreme poverty like now.”
4. Pete Townshend stains late bandmates’ legacies
Fans of The Who guitarist “Won’t Get Fooled Again” if they ever thought Townshend missed having his late bandmates, drummer Keith Moon and bassist John Entwistle, around for gigs.
“It’s not going to make Who fans very happy, but thank God they’re gone,” the British rocker told Rolling Stone in an interview out in November, adding they “were f —ing difficult to play with.” Townshend also threw in that the two “never, ever managed to create bands for themselves. I think my musical discipline, my musical efficiency asw a rhythm player, held the band together.”
5. Kid Rock’s obscene Oprah rant
The Trump-loving rapper/country crooner’s crass onstage rant at a Nashville bar in November was only made worse by the fact that its target was Oprah.
Apparently under the influence of alcohol, Kid unleashed an ugly tirade that included such gems as “F — — Oprah. Oprah Winfrey is like ‘Hey, I just want women to believe in this s —.’ F — — her. She can s — — d — — sideways.”
6. Justin Bieber’s bizarre fight challenge
Who knew that the Biebs had it in for Tom Cruise? The answer is neither one of them, but that didn’t stop the singer from challenging the “Top Gun” star to a row back in June. “I wanna challenge Tom Cruise to fight in the octagon,” Bieber tweeted at the time. “Tom if you don’t take this fight your (sic) scared and you will never live it down. Who is willing to put on the fight?”
He even tagged Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White, but days later said he was just joking and that Cruise would “probably whoop my a** in a fight.”
7. Roseanne Barr attacks #MeToo accusers
There’s no shortage of controversial or offensive things Barr has spewed, so just take your pick. The comedian incited groans again in March when she referred to women who shared their stories of sexual harassment or assault as “hos” during an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens.
Barr said that a woman had recently told her, “ ‘Well they were there in the (hotel) room ‘cause they thought they were gonna get a job 15 years ago.’” Barr said she responded, “It’s like well, ‘cause they’re hos.”
8. Louis C.K.’s abhorrent humor attempt
This isn’t the best way to stage a comeback. Comedian Louis C.K. — who admitted to masturbating in front of women in 2017 at the height of the #MeToo movement — has since returned to stand-up comedy with an international tour.
But a Holocaust joke he made in November, while earning applause from the crowd in Israel, didn’t go over well with the rest of the world. “I’d rather be in Auschwitz than New York City,” he cracked. “I mean now, not when it was open.”
9. Madonna’s melodrama
When Madonna’s interview with New York Times Magazine didn’t turn out exactly as she’d hoped, she threw a hissy fit and declared that she felt “raped” by it.
Of the June article, titled “Madonna at Sixty,” the singer posted on Instagram: “The journalist who wrote this article spent days and hours and months with me and was invited into a world which many people don’t get to see, but chose to focus on trivial and superficial matters such as … never ending comments about my age which would never have been mentioned had I been a MAN! … sorry I spent 5 minutes with her. It makes me feel raped.”
10. Kim Kardashian’s roundabout realization
Who knew all it would take was a White House visit to get Kim K. to stop posting endless scantily clad selfies? The reality show star, who’s had to mingle with politicians as she’s taken up criminal-justice reform activism, explained the reasoning.
“I realized I could not even scroll through Instagram in front of my kids without full nudity coming up on my feed pretty much all the time,” Kardashian told The Cut in November. “And I definitely contributed to that … I also did think, like, ‘Okay, I’m here in the White House and then the next day I was posting, like, a crazy bikini selfie.’ And I was thinking, ‘I hope they don’t see this. I have to go back there next week.’”

Texto completo: "Linda Ronstadt: The Sound of My Voice" airs on CNN. And a new season of "Doctor Who" kicks off on BBC America.
What's on TV
LINDA RONSTADT: THE SOUND OF MY VOICE (2019) 9 p.m. on CNN. "If I were going to choose something to do, it would not be to stand up in front of a lot of people," the singer Linda Ronstadt says in this documentary. "But I love to sing, I love to sing, I love music. So at some point, you do whatever you have to do to do music." That's not exactly a stereotypical rock-star outlook, but Ronstadt didn't have the typical rock star's career: After reaching arena-level success in rock in the 1970s, she moved across genres, releasing albums of pop standards and Mariachi songs. ("People would think that I was trying to reinvent myself," she says in the documentary, "but I never invented myself to start with.") Her varied career is the focus here; it's discussed by both Ronstadt and by interviewees like Emmylou Harris, Bonnie Raitt, Cameron Crowe, Jackson Browne and Dolly Parton. "The political intelligence and matter-of-fact feminism that emerge in this portrait are among its most intriguing aspects," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. He wrote that Ronstadt's "cleareyed, down-to-earth thoughts on her profession, her family and American culture (musical and otherwise) make her someone you want to know better."
DOCTOR WHO 8 p.m. on BBC America. Jodie Whittaker begins her second season as the Doctor in this first chapter of a two-part season opener, cheekily titled "Spyfall." As ever, few details have been released, though it has been announced that Stephen Fry and the British comedian Lenny Henry will appear. Also in the season: fictionalized versions of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, played by the actors Robert Glenister and Goran Visnjic.
THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) 10 p.m. on TNT. The cinematographer Roger Deakins is back in the Oscar race this year with "1917," a World War I movie directed by Sam Mendes that has inserted itself into awards-season conversations. In the 1990s, Deakins received his first Academy Award nomination for filming this classic Stephen King adaptation, about the camaraderie of two men (played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) at a fictional state prison in Maine.
What's Streaming
SPINNING OUT Stream on Netflix. Ice and melodrama coalesce in this soapy new Netflix series, which follows a professional figure skater (Kaya Scodelario) ready to call it quits after sustaining a serious injury in the rink. She returns to the ice after getting paired with a new partner (Evan Roderick); drama follows both on the ice and away from it.
MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (1975) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon and iTunes. The British humorist and musician Neil Innes died on Sunday. See him pester Eric Idle as an inappropriately cheery balladeer in this Monty Python comedy, which turns 45 years old in a few months. Other highlights include the terrifying "killer bunny," the "holy hand grenade" and a very dour set of chanting monks (Innes plays one of them, too).

Texto completo: The Associated Press
NEENAH, Wis. - A New York City education official was arrested in Wisconsin for allegedly using a computer to facilitate a child sex crime, police say.
David Hay was arrested Sunday at General Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee County following an ongoing undercover investigation, according to Neenah police.
Hay, 39, of Brooklyn, N.Y., was booked into the Winnebago County Jail on a possible charge of use of a computer to facilitate a child sex crime, according to a police statement. No additional details about the allegations against Hay have been released because the case is still under investigation, Neenah Police Lt. Pat Pedersen said Tuesday.
Formal charges have not been filed against Hay, and it is not yet clear whether he has hired an attorney who could comment on his behalf.
The New York City Department of Education said it has fired Hay, who was the deputy chief of staff to the chancellor, according to the New York Times.
"These allegations are incredibly disturbing and absolutely unacceptable," Miranda Barbot, a spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement. "We took immediate action removing Mr. Hay from payroll and are terminating him."
A website profile on Hay's alma mater, the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said he grew up in the small Wisconsin city of Antigo and later worked in the Kettle Moraine School District, among other places.

5 issues for the new decade

Información de publicación: Tampa Bay Times ; Tampa Bay [Tampa Bay]. 01 Jan 2020: 12.

Texto completo: A Times editorial

What will Tampa Bay be like in 2030? Here are five key issues that will help shape the region over the next decade.

The census occurs only once a decade and determines everything from the number of seats Florida will have in the U.S. House to the Sunshine States share of federal funds for health care, transportation and other priorities. So its important to count every person to ensure our fair share of representation and federal dollars. Florida surpassed New York in 2014 to become the third-most populous state, but that status wont be reflected in congressional seats until the results of the 2020 census are in. No. 1 California understands the importance of counting every person and is spending $187 million on outreach and education, according to the New York Times. No. 2 Texas and Florida are spending nothing. The Urban Institute predicts as many as 320,000 Floridians could go uncounted, including many people of color and those with lower incomes. The census counted 18,801,310 people in Florida in 2010, and as a result the state picked up two seats in Congress. The population is estimated at 21.65 million and rising fast, and Florida is expected to pick up two more seats. But it is foolish to endanger the states clout by failing to do everything to count every resident.

Before the new decade is out, the damage from climate change will be more obvious than ever. The effects are coming faster and harder, and the curve will have steepened by 2030. Will Florida have retreated from parts of the Florida Keys? Will efforts to keep Miami from flooding have worked ... or failed? In Tampa Bay, some areas will have to be hardened with seawalls and raised bridges and infrastructure, and well have to retreat from others and let nature  mangroves and the like  serve as natural barriers. Building codes and zoning will have to adapt to a new reality of rising seas and more powerful hurricanes. In the last 30 years, carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks in Tampa Bay have increased by 55 percent. In fact, 2017 was the first year in which cars, trucks and SUVs began to spew more carbon dioxide than electric utilities across the nation. Time is running out, and this is the decade in which things must change before its too late.

The coming decade will see much-needed improvements to Tampa Bays transportation system, from a new Howard Frankland Bridge to the early spine of a regional bus rapid transit system. But these are little more than place-holding projects given the regions tremendous growth. Whats really needed is a transformational change in how we view, use and fund mass transit. Hillsborough County voters passed a local sales tax for mass transit and other transportation improvements in 2018, but that program is bottled up in the courts. Pinellas County is considering asking voters in November to approve a sales tax for transportation. Over the coming decade, all counties in the region need a robust, dedicated funding source for mass transit  and there should be a commitment to a unified mass transit system across the Tampa Bay region.

The downtowns of the bay areas biggest cities  Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater  are poised to look significantly different over the coming decade. In Tampa, the new housing, retail and offices in the Channel District, and near Water Works Park in the north, are making the city more alive and more diverse. The city of St. Petersburg will be re-imagining the 85-acre Tropicana Field site  with or without a ballpark  and preparing to unveil its latest landmark this year, a new St. Pete Pier on the downtown waterfront. Clearwater is moving ahead with a $64 million waterfront development that calls for a redesign of Coachman Park, a gateway plaza and other renovations. Residents and businesses want the energy and convenience of being downtown, an appetite that requires continuing public investments to keep the city centers growing. Can the downtowns continue to prosper even if the economy slows?

Tampa Bay has made great strides in the last decade toward reducing parochial bickering and working toward common goals as one robust region. The mayors of Tampa, St. Petersburg and Clearwater have established stronger ties. There is a spirit of cooperation on issues ranging from transportation to climate change. But there are concerning cracks in the relationships that cant grow larger. Tampas plan for transforming treated wastewater into drinking water drew unwarranted criticism from St. Petersburg. The Tampa-Hillsborough Economic Development Corp. and the Tampa Chamber of Commerce changed their names to include Tampa Bay without consulting with their neighbors or broadening their missions, and that did not go over well on the other side of the bay. The new decade should bring more regionalism to solve big issues, such as mass transit and the future of the Tampa Bay Rays. Without a united approach, Tampa Bay will not compete with other metro areas. We are stronger as one voice even as we nurture our distinctive communities.

Texto completo: Elaine Brown
Mount Kisco - Elaine Brown, aka "Nana" to all who knew and loved her, passed away comfortably on Dec. 31st at 91 years old at the home of her daughter Stephanie Spiegel in Chappaqua.
She was born at Hunts Point Hospital on May 2, 1928 to Mary and Abraham Isaac Gordon, ne Mary Warschaw, and grew up on Macombs Road in the Bronx. After high school, Elaine registered for a nursing program but had to stop attending after becoming very ill with pneumonia. From there, she learned bookkeeping skills at her father's coat manufacturing company in Manhattan and used them her entire life. She re-connected and married her childhood friend Samuel Brown on December 26th, 1948 during a snowstorm, where she had to take the subway to her own wedding, which she did with humor and calm.
Samuel and Elaine lived in Bayside, NY but eventually settled in Jericho, N.Y. They adopted two children, Owen and Stephanie, from the Louise Wise agency. After a long wait, becoming a mother twice was the thrill of Elaine's life. Her children became the light of her world.
Elaine and Samuel were business partners always: first opening an insurance and real estate business together in Bayside, NY, then opening three card and gift shops on Long Island, and finally working together at the Center for Professional Development in New Jersey. Elaine who was sharp and competent became the head bookkeeper and helped open an office in Amsterdam. Eventually, she and Sam moved to Boca Raton to open a company office there. Once retired, they moved to Westchester, NY to be near their six grandchildren. Elaine lived with Sam in Old Farm Lake in Chappaqua, NY and after his passing, moved to Woodcrest Village in Mount Kisco, NY. She loved the community of people there and the friendships she made.
"Nana" mostly lived for her grandchildren Ben, Marissa, Michelle, Aimee, Andrew and Dylan. She played an integral part in every aspect of their lives, and they loved and worshipped her beyond words.
Elaine became an avid volunteer at both the JCCA's Pleasantville Cottage School, working with abused and neglected children, and at Northern Westchester Hospital, where she worked in the cancer center, the gift shop, and eventually in the Transitional Care Unit (TCU) which she helped open. She loved giving of herself to others. Since she loved soup, she was beyond touched when the staff of the TCU threw her a party with all kinds of soups and labeled the party "To a Soup-er Volunteer."
In her spare time, she enjoyed playing Words with Friends, reading books and The New York Times, watching Jeopardy and the news, discussing politics, and being on her phone and computer. Most of all, she loved texting, talking to and spending time with family, extended family and friends. She was also the "emoji" queen.
To know Elaine was to love her. People gravitated to her incredibly warmth, wit and caring nature. She was a role model of grace and dignity. And as her own doctor said to her caregiver before her passing, "you will never meet a finer woman." She was strong, wise and the self proclaimed "every lasting optimist," always looking to the bright side of life. "Nana" will be missed beyond measure by all who knew and loved her.
Thank you to Hospice of Westchester and Putnam and her end of life caregiver's Doreen Scott and Josephine Petriello who took such wonderful care of her. Donations in her name are being accepted by the JCCA, 120 Wall Street, 20th Floor, New York, NY 10005 or on their website, www.jccany.org .

Texto completo: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the country’s parliament to grant him immunity from prosecution in several corruption cases.
Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. He has denied any wrongdoing.
He tried to downplay the request in a televised statement on New Year’s Day, calling for a “temporary” measure that would grant him immunity for only one term of parliament, according to the New York Times. Netanyahu claimed the potential immunity was meant to prevent “political indictments whose purpose is to distort the will of the people.”
“That’s what happened to me,” he said.
Netanyahu, the longest-serving Israeli prime minister, is seeking a fourth term in an election scheduled for March 2. It will be the country’s third election in a year after the earlier elections, in April and September, failed to give Netanyahu or his opponent, Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party, a majority to form a viable government.
In the past, Netanyahu, 70, signaled that he would not seek immunity but later declared immunity was a “foundation stone of democracy,” as the deadline for such a request loomed.
As he fights for his political future, the prime minister declared victory earlier this week as members of his conservative Likud party voted to keep him as their leader.

Texto completo: The Chinese researcher who was on his way to Beijing when a customs officer pulled him aside and searched his luggage, finding 21 vials of “biological material” in a sock in his suitcase, likely coordinated with the Chinese government, according to prosecutors.
At a hearing Monday in Boston, Magistrate Judge David Hennessy granted a request to hold Zaosong Zheng, 29, without bail.
Zheng’s case is part of a federal investigation into hundreds of cases involving the potential theft of intellectual property by Chinese nationals. His case “was not an isolated incident,” prosecutors stated in the motion to hold him without bail.
“Rather, it appears to have been a coordinated crime, with likely involvement by the Chinese government,” they said.
Authorities alleged Zheng stole vials of cancer cells from a laboratory at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Two other Chinese scientists who worked at the same laboratory as Zheng had successfully smuggled stolen biological material out of the country, prosecutors said in court documents.
Zheng was preparing to board Hainan Airlines Flight 482 from Boston to Beijing in early December when customs officers identified the Chinese national as “a high risk for possibly exporting undeclared biological material,” according to the affidavit.
Under questioning, Zheng first said the vials “were not important and had nothing to do with his research.” Then he admitted he had stolen eight samples and had replicated another 11 based on a colleague’s research. On his return to China, he planned to take the samples to Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and publish the research under his own name.
Zheng booked another flight to China for the next day and was detained by the FBI at the airport when he arrived. He waived his Miranda rights through a Mandarin interpreter and told the agents he planned to use the material for cancer research. He was then arrested.
Zheng’s former roommate told investigators, according to court documents, that the researcher had packed all his belongings ahead of his flight, indicating that Zheng did not plan to return to the United States.
He was in the U.S. on a visa sponsored by Harvard University, which has since been revoked, a spokesman for the University told the New York Times.

Texto completo: When Walt Whitman arrived in Washington at the end of 1862 to take up residence in the city and serve as a hospital volunteer, the construction of the Capitol dome was not yet complete. In a dispatch published in the Oct. 4, 1863, edition of The New York Times , Whitman described this “vast eggshell, built of iron and glass, this dome — a beauteous bubble” that “emerges calm and aloft from the hill, out of a dense mass of trees.” The poet recounted how a “few days ago, poking about there, eastern side” he found the yet to be hoisted Statue of Freedom that now crowns the Capitol dome “all dismembered, scattered on the ground, by the basement front.”
In retrospect it’s a rather on-the-nose metaphor, this personified representation of liberty “standing in the mud” while the nation immolated itself in civil war, yet still visible to our greatest poet and prophet of democracy, perhaps signifying the incomplete task of the American project.
When the war began, Whitman was despondent, but the violence of those years seemed to strengthen and clarify his faith in democracy, a faith that would take on a transcendent dimension. For the poet, democracy wasn’t simply the least bad form of government, it wasn’t reducible to dreary policy and endless debate, but it was rather a vital, transformative and regenerative ethos. Even as the survival of what President Abraham Lincoln called the “last, best hope of earth” was in doubt, Whitman’s belief in the philosophical and political foundation of the nation flourished.
If the war against illiberalism takes place on many fronts, including the economic and the cultural, then one domain where the revanchists are clearly gaining power is in the realm of the transcendent. In the delusions of “blood and soil” there is for many the attraction of a deeper meaning. Authoritarians claim that they offer their nations (or at least a segment of the population) unity and purpose. The 20th-century German philosopher (and victim of the Nazis) Walter Benjamin warned how fascism engages an “aestheticization of politics,” where spectacle and transcendence provide a type of ecstasy for its adherents. Watch clips of fevered crowds, from today or the past, chanting against “enemies of the people”; they are malignant scenes, but ones that in no small part mimic religious revivals.
Critics of democracy often claim that it offers no similar sense of transcendence. The 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche castigated democracy as a system of “quarantine mechanisms” for human desires, and as “such they are … very boring.” If the individual unit of democracy is the citizen, authoritarian societies thrill to the Übermensch , the superman promising that “I alone can fix it.” Yet I would argue that all of the hallmarks of authoritarianism — the rallies and crowds, the marching and military parades, the shouting demagogue promising his followers that they are superior — are wind and hot air. What fascism offers isn’t elevation but cheap transcendence, a counterfeit of meaning rather than the real thing.
Whitman understood that democracy wasn’t “very boring” but rather a political system that could deliver on the promises that authoritarianism only pretended it would. For the poet, democracy wasn’t just a way of passing laws or a manner of organizing a government; democracy was a method of transcendence in its own right.
Human beings are meaning-making creatures. A politics that is unable to translate its positions into some sort of transcendent language, pointing to something greater than the individual, is a politics that will ultimately fail. Whitman understood this. Though political theorists of democracy routinely speak of Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence or Hamilton and Madison’s Federalist Papers , Whitman’s poetry of a half-century later explicates the metaphysical underpinnings of transcendent democracy. Where Nietzsche would offer the illusions of the Übermensch , Whitman would sing a song of the “divine average.”
Such was Whitman’s description of Lincoln in a March 1863 letter to two New York friends. The president, wrote Whitman, had a face “like a hoosier Michael Angelo, so awful ugly it becomes beautiful, with its strange mouth, its deep cut, criss-cross lines, and its doughnut complexion.” The essence of the “divine average” is that Lincoln was great not necessarily in spite of his supposed ugliness but in part because of it — that all of us have a divine greatness because we share in the common foibles of our humanity. A king, a dictator, an Übermensch will pretend that his lot is above the least of his subjects, but as Whitman would counter in “Song of Myself,” his most celebrated poem, “every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you,” whether from the slave or slave master, the refugee migrant or the president.
In Whitman’s understanding of democracy, we’re bound to one another in the experience of being finite creatures with bodies that will one day die. The scholar Kevin J. Hayes explains that in Whitman’s estimation, people must “feel the humanity within the self. Deep personal understanding can broaden individual perspective, creating a sense of humanity large enough to include everyone.” A demagogue may whip his admirers into a hateful frenzy and impart the illusion of unity, but the loving work of democracy actually provides that unity with others who may be very different from ourselves. Hayes describes Whitman in “Song of Myself” “going from the personal to the national” and finally “to the universal.”
What democracy requires is mutual affection over that shared predicament; what it needs is not just politics but also transcendence, enchantment, grace and love. We mustn’t be against transcendence but against the wrong kind of transcendence. Meaning is not to be found in the cheapness of “blood and soil” but in the mystic chains that connect every woman and man to one another.
Today democracy is imperiled not by civil war but by a citizenry torn apart by warring ideologies, in part because of the compelling, if nihilistic, story that authoritarians have told about nationality. An authoritarian promises a shallow union with others who look like you; the true democrat ensures that such a union is possible with everyone. In democracy there is the reconciliation of opposites, the elevation of the vernacular, the transcendence of the individual through the equality of humanity.
Writing about the Statue of Freedom , Whitman noted that the pieces “are at present all separated, ready to be hoisted to their place. On the Capitol generally, much work remains to be done.” Sadly, at the end of a tumultuous year and decade, this observation still rings true. All the more reason amid today’s national rancor to revisit Whitman’s open embrace of the democratic ideal, his declaration that “every atom as belonging to me as good belongs to you,” no matter where you were born.

Paul Krugman: The legacy of a destructive decade of austerity

Texto completo: A decade ago, the world was living in the aftermath of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Financial markets had stabilized, but the real economy was still in terrible shape, with around 40 million European and North American workers unemployed.
Fortunately, economists had learned a lot from the experience of the Great Depression. In particular, they knew that fiscal austerity — slashing government spending in an attempt to balance the budget — is a really bad idea in a depressed economy.
Unfortunately, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spent the first half of the 2010s doing exactly what both theory and history told them not to do. And this wrong turn on policy cast a long shadow, economically and politically. In particular, the deficit obsession of 2010-2015 helped set the stage for the current crisis of democracy.
Why is austerity in a depressed economy a bad idea? Because an economy is not like a household, whose income and spending are separate things. In the economy as a whole, my spending is your income and your spending is my income.
What happens if everyone tries to cut spending at the same time, as was the case in the aftermath of the financial crisis? Everyone’s income falls. So to avoid a depression you need to have someone — namely, the government — maintain or, better yet, increase spending while everyone else is cutting. And in 2009 most governments engaged in at least a bit of fiscal stimulus.
In 2010, however, policy discourse was taken over by people insisting, on one side, that we needed to cut deficits immediately or we would all turn into Greece and, on the other side, that spending cuts wouldn’t hurt the economy because they would increase confidence.
The intellectual basis for these claims was always flimsy; the handful of academic papers purporting to make the case for austerity quickly collapsed under scrutiny. And events soon confirmed Macroeconomics 101: America didn’t turn into Greece, and countries that imposed harsh austerity suffered severe economic downturns.
So why did policy and opinion makers go all in for austerity when they should have been fighting unemployment?
One answer, which shouldn’t be discounted, is that inveighing against the evils of deficits makes you sound responsible, at least to people who haven’t studied the issue or kept up with the state of economic research. That’s why I used to mock centrists and media figures who preached the need for austerity as Very Serious People. Indeed, to this day, billionaires with political ambitions imagine that dire warnings about debt prove their seriousness.
Beyond that, the push for austerity was always driven in large part by ulterior motives. Specifically, debt fears were used as an excuse to cut spending on social programs, and also as an excuse for hobbling the ambitions of center-left governments.
Here in the United States, Republicans went through the entire Obama era claiming to be deeply concerned about budget deficits, forcing the country into years of spending cuts that slowed economic recovery. The moment Donald Trump moved into the White House, all those supposed concerns vanished, vindicating those of us who argued from the beginning that Republicans who posed as deficit hawks were phonies.
This politically weaponized Keynesianism is, by the way, probably the main reason U.S. economic growth has been good (not great) over the past two years, even though the 2017 tax cut completely failed to deliver the promised surge in private investment: federal spending has been growing at a rate not seen since the early years of the past decade.
But why does this history matter? After all, at this point unemployment rates in both the U.S. and Europe are near or below pre-crisis levels. Maybe there was a lot of unnecessary pain along the way, but aren’t we OK now?
No, we aren’t. The austerity years left many lasting scars, especially on politics.
There are multiple explanations for the populist rage that has put democracy at risk across the Western world, but the side effects of austerity rank high on the list.
In Eastern Europe, white nationalist parties came to power after center-left governments alienated the working class by letting themselves be talked or bullied into austerity policies. In Britain, support for right-wing extremists is strongest in regions hit hardest by fiscal austerity. And would we have Trump if years of wrongheaded austerity hadn’t delayed economic recovery under Barack Obama?
Beyond that, I’d argue that austerity mania fatally damaged elite credibility. If ordinary working families no longer believe that traditional elites know what they’re doing or care about people like them, well, what happened during the austerity years suggests that they’re right. True, it’s delusional to imagine that people like Trump will serve their interests better, but it’s a lot harder to denounce a scam artist when you yourself spent years promoting destructive policies simply because they sounded serious.
In short, we’re in the mess we’re in largely because of the wrong turn policy took a decade ago.

Texto completo: DALLAS -- Unauthorized immigrants don't pay taxes.
It's one of the most common but inaccurate talking points in the ongoing immigration debate.
While some unauthorized immigrants may be paid in cash and avoid federal taxes altogether, some tax experts say it's almost impossible to imagine anyone in Texas avoiding state taxes if they rent homes, pay for gasoline and generally buy things.
Because Texas doesn't have a state income tax, the state has higher sales and property taxes and taxes more products and services than other states, said John Kennedy, senior policy analyst at the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonprofit that studies the impact of tax policies on Texans.
Kennedy said that means there's "no way" unauthorized immigrants living in Texas are able to avoid paying the same taxes most Texans do.
A 2016 analysis from the Waco-based Perryman Group found that the unauthorized immigrant workforce in Texas contributes about $32.2 billion annually in taxes.
Here's how those taxes are paid or collected:
Sales tax
Kennedy said that in Texas, the sales tax is the tax of the state. In fiscal year 2018, the sales tax made up 57% of the state's total tax collections, according to the Texas Comptroller's State Annual Cash Report.
Anytime unauthorized immigrants fill up their gas tanks, buy groceries or subscribe to a cable TV package, they're paying taxes to the state.
"You pay them," Kennedy said. "There's no way to avoid them."
Property tax
The Texas Legislature may have put a cap on how fast property tax rates can rise across the state, but homeowners know there's no escaping them.
The same goes to renters, Kennedy said, because landlords factor in those costs to the rent they charge their tenants every month.
Sandy Rollins, executive director of the Texas Tenants Union, a nonprofit that works to settle disputes between landlords and renters, said that there's really nothing in Texas law preventing landlords from passing property tax costs to the renter.
That means immigrants who rent houses and apartments are still paying them even if they're not directly writing a check or money order to the county tax office.
"It's not the landlord's gift to the tenant to pay the property tax bill. Landlords are in their business to make money and most costs are passed on to the renters," Rollins said.
Social Security, payroll deductions
Since March, the Social Security Administration has notified 570,000 employers around the country that they have workers on their payroll whose Social Security numbers don't match a number on their records.
It's a new strategy by the Trump administration to crack down on employers hiring unauthorized workers, The New York Times reported.
But even a fake Social Security number is good for paying taxes because employers are required to withhold Social Security and other payroll taxes from an employee's check regardless of whether the number is valid or not, said Kim Reuben, director of the Tax Policy Institute's State and Local Finance Initiative.
The Social Security Administration found in a 2013 analysis that unauthorized immigrants paid about $13 billion into the program's trust fund through withheld payroll taxes in 2010.
Unauthorized immigrants "pay into the system and they'll likely never see any of the benefits," Reuben said.
Individual taxpayer identification number
Unauthorized immigrants are also eligible to file taxes using what's called an ITIN number.
These numbers allow individuals who are not eligible for a Social Security number to pay taxes they are required to pay to the federal government.
The Internal Revenue Service estimated that in 2015, about 4.4 million people paid their taxes using ITIN numbers.
And while those figures are not exclusively attributed to unauthorized immigrants, using ITIN numbers to pay taxes is one of the most popular ways for them to do so, said Alex Nowrasteh, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.
"This is a nice workaround for everybody and especially for unauthorized immigrants who want to keep their noses clean and attract as little attention as possible," Nowrasteh said.
Nowrasteh said that upward of 75% of unauthorized immigrants file taxes with the federal government. He added that the existence of ITIN numbers is a sign of the government's desire to collect taxes regardless of status.
"It's an indication of how broken a lot of the immigration system is, but it is a workaround that is probably the least bad option when compared to the other options, which are identity theft and borrowing someone else's Social Security number," Nowrasteh said.

Texto completo: If your New Year’s resolutions include feeling healthier and more sane, a brisk run or a slow, steady jog may be the start of a new and improved you.
Running is hard, but also easy. No gym memberships are necessary. No special equipment is required. Being hung over, as some are sure to be on Jan. 1, isn’t an excuse to forgo a run. You’ll just burn alcohol fumes along the way.
That’s an old joke among long-time runners. Whether you’re a veteran or new to running, few places compare with Sonoma County and the North Bay for getting into stride.
We have trails along coastal bluffs and beneath towering redwoods, backcountry roads lined with vineyards and mountaintops where hard effort is rewarded with jaw- dropping vistas.
Some runners have a tradition of greeting the New Year by heading out before dawn and catching a sunrise, weather permitting. As one option, the eastern route at Santa Rosa’s Taylor Mountain Regional Park, rising 1,100  feet to the summit, is a good spot to watch the new day and year begin.
A headlamp or other light source is a must for running in the dark. Wirecutter, the New York Times consumer guide, recommends the Black Diamond Spot. For visibility, consider the Tracer360 vest made by noxgear.
If daylight and the energy of crowds is more your thing, there are local options for that, too. In Santa Rosa, the Phaby-Gray Resolution Run sponsored by the Empire Runners Club is a popular New Year’s Day draw, with more than 300 runners expected this year.
The 5K event, now in its 41st year, is held at A Place to Play Park in downtown Santa Rosa. Sign up at empirerunners.org.
“I love running this race and then going out to the coast on a nice day,” said Andrea Guzman, who lives in Santa Rosa and works in Napa for the Napa Valley Wine Train.
Guzman’s favorite off-road course is the 3.8-mile North Sonoma Mountain Ridge Trail from Sonoma Mountain Road to Jack London State Historic Park. The trail offers a fantastic 180-degree view of northern Sonoma Valley and the Santa Rosa Plain.
She also loves running Riverfront Regional Park in Windsor, with its peaceful quarry ponds lined by trees. Whenever possible, she runs with her dog, a lab and pit bull mix and a great long distance runner.
Guzman’s goal for 2020 is to run at Tolay Lake Regional Park southeast of Petaluma. The recently opened park offers 11 miles of trails through a canvas of grasslands and cattle country. It’s like stepping back in time to an era before vineyards and large-scale development.
Another New Year’s Day option is the Napa Valley Resolution Run just over the mountains in Yountville.The event, sponsored by the Athletic Feat running and biking store in Napa, features 5K and 10K courses on paved trails and roads lined by vineyards.
Sign up for this race at napavalleyresolutionrun.com.
The Santa Rosa and Yountville races begin at 10 a.m., a perfect start time for runners who need a few hours of extra sleep after a late night ringing in the new year.
“Have all that fun and then let’s run it out,” said Dame Rahal, owner of Athletic Feat.
Rahal and a friend started the Napa Valley Resolution Run on a whim in 2013. Their expectations for the first year were so low Rahal promised entrants a warm bowl of chili the morning of the event. When entries outpaced projections, the pair were forced to scramble for more cooks and food.
Chili is no longer served at the race, which has grown to include almost 500 entrants.
“It’s fun to see everyone,” Rahal said. “The sun is up and it tends to be crisp in terms of weather.”
Don’t give up.
Whether alone or in crowds, on roads or on trails, the key to sticking to a running plan is to not get discouraged. Running indeed requires effort, so think in terms of a marathon and not a sprint.
“Often we put a lot of pressure on ourselves when we run. We have to run and run fast, and if we stop and walk, we are kind of a failure,” said Ralph Purugganan, a store manager at Healdsburg Running Co.
But walking is not failure, Purugganan said. On steep or uneven terrain, such as on trails, walking can be just as efficient — and safer — than running.
Purugganan suggests newer runners go for time rather than distance, to lessen the pressure on “getting the miles in.” And take it slow, he said.
“We are so incredibly lucky in Napa and Sonoma counties,” Rahal said. “Pick a direction and for the most part, you are going to find unparalleled beauty. It’s why people visit us.”
It’s also why we run.

SJC rules in favor of UMass student newspaper editor in defamation case

Texto completo: In a closely watched defamation case, the state's highest court has ruled in favor of a one-time editor at a University of Massachusetts student newspaper.
The Supreme Judicial Court said Cady Vishniac can't be held liable for publishing a synopsis of a police blotter item alongside photos police released to help them find an allegedly suspicious man who was reported to be taking photos of women — but who later denied the allegations, was never charged, and whose phone wasn't found to have any such images.
The court affirmed that journalists are protected from defamation claims when they fairly and accurately report about official public actions and proceedings, a legal idea known as the fair report privilege.
“Once police undertake an official response to a complaint, both that response and the allegations that gave rise to it fall within the fair report privilege," Justice Barbara A. Lenk wrote.
But the court declined to extend that privilege to all reports in public records such as police logs because they may include anonymous complaints making accusations of criminal activity.
“Such anonymous accusations, without a subsequent response by police, are neither official statements nor official actions cloaked by the fair report privilege," the ruling said.
Frank D. LoMonte, a professor of media law at the University of Florida who has followed the case, said the ruling “is a fairly narrow reaffirmation of basic, accepted principles of privilege."
LoMonte, also director of the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information, said the ruling gave no indication that the court sees student journalists any differently than professional journalists.
“There's nothing to indicate that a student media outlet will get less benefit in the eyes of the law," he said.
The case — which could have gone to trial if the SJC had ruled the other way — revolves around an incident on March 13, 2013, that court records describe in detail. University of Massachusetts Boston police received a report that an unknown man was engaging in suspicious activity near campus, with a witness telling police that he was taking photos of women on a bus. Police couldn't find him.
A police blotter report about the incident was published by the school newspaper, Mass Media.
Later, UMass police received photographs from the bus company. At the request of police, Mass Media published the photos. They ran under the title “Have you Seen This Man?" and included a synopsis of the incident that described the man as allegedly snapping pictures of women “without their permission," and a request for people to call campus security if they saw him.
Jon Butcher, then a security engineer at UMass Boston's information technology department, was subsequently identified as the person in the photos. Attempts to reach him Wednesday by phone and e-mail were not successful.
UMass police took his phone and searched image files on it. None of the ones dated March 13, 2013, were of women; several showed buses and a bus driver.
In court documents, Butcher said he took photos to document what he believed to be serious safety concerns about the bus company and its drivers. The documents note that a year after the incident, the bus company was shut down due to safety issues. Butcher also said he was accosted by a driver who saw what he was doing.
After the publication of the stories, Butcher said he felt negative repercussions at work and feared for his safety, according to court documents. Bus drivers kept copies of the newspaper articles about him open on their dashboards, he was given a higher volume of low-level work, and he was left out of key meetings, he said. Months later, he left his UMass job.
In 2014, Butcher filed suit in superior court against UMass, university officials, and Vishniac, who had been a student and the newspaper's news editor when the items and photos were published. His claims included defamation and emotional distress. The court ruled in favor of the defendants.
But the state appeals court said the lower court erred and the newspaper's publication of the item accompanied by the photos wasn't protected by the fair report privilege.
The office of Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey subsequently stepped in to defend the former student editor, deeming the case to be in the public's interest.
And Vishniac, who hasn't practiced any sort of journalism since her time at UMass, appealed to the state's highest court, which ruled in her favor on the last day of 2019.
“I am so completely relieved," Vishniac, now 34, said Wednesday — relieved for herself, she said, and also for any newspaper editor who puts a simple police blotter item in a newspaper.
Jeffrey J. Pyle, an attorney with Prince Lobel Tye, who has represented The New York Times and The Boston Globe, said he sees the ruling “as a win for crime journalism in Massachusetts."
“This was a case where a student newspaper largely reprinted what was in a campus police blotter and the court recognized that's protected," he said.

The Watch Is Smart, But Itcan’t Replace Your Doctor

Texto completo: The Apple Watch has been quite successful as a smartwatch. The company would also like it to succeed as a medical device. The recently published results of the Apple Heart Study in the New England Journal of Medicine show there is still a long way to go.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States - nearly 2% - have atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that brings increased risk of events like clots, heart attacks and strokes. It is thought that about 700,000 of the people with the condition don’t know they have it.
A selling point of the watch is a sensor that can monitor a wearer’s pulse and potentially detect atrial fibrillation.
A sizable study
To test the device’s ability to aid diagnosis, a group of researchers enrolled almost 420,000 Apple Watch wearers in a study. (Some of the researchers were Apple employees, and Apple sponsored the research.) Participants were monitored for about four months. Over that time, 2,161 of the study participants were notified of an irregular pulse, representing just over 0.5% of the sample.
Those people were offered telemedicine visits and, if their symptoms were mild, were offered electrocardiogram patches to wear for up to a week to help confirm a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Participants mailed the patches back and, if the results indicated an emergency, were contacted immediately and instructed to receive care. If the results were positive for atrial fibrillation but did not require immediate medical attention, the participants were offered a second telemedicine visit and instructed to see their regular physician.
But only 450 of the 2,161 people who were notified about having an irregular pulse returned their sensor patches for evaluation. This means that among those who signed up for the study, wore the watch and got a health alert, almost 80% ignored it.
Of the 450 participants who returned patches, atrial fibrillation was confirmed in 34%, or 153 people. Those 153 are about 0.04% of the 420,000 participants.
This doesn’t mean that the Apple device failed. It probably led some participants to be diagnosed sooner than they might have. How many, and how much of a difference this made in their health, though, is debatable.
Many news outlets reporting on the study mentioned a result: a “positive predictive value” of 84%. That statistic refers to the chance that someone actually has the condition if he or she gets a positive test result.
But this result wasn’t calculated from any of the numbers above. It specifically refers to the subset of patients who had an irregular pulse notification while wearing their confirmatory patch. That’s a very small minority of participants. Of the 86 who got a notification while wearing a patch, 72 had confirmed evidence of atrial fibrillation. (Dividing 72 by 86 yields 0.84, which is how you get a positive predictive value of 84%.)
Positive predictive values, although useful when talking to patients, are not always a good measure of a test’s effectiveness. When you test a device on a group where everyone has a disease, for instance, all positive results are correct. A flipped coin would have a positive predictive power of 100% in such a population.
Limitations
Other test characteristics like sensitivity (if you have a disease, how likely the test is to be positive) and specificity (if you don’t have a disease, how likely the test is to be negative) are more effective in evaluating the overall quality of a test. This study, unfortunately, was not designed to determine those characteristics.
Other methods to screen and diagnose people with atrial fibrillation are available. A systematic review of mobile health devices for atrial fibrillation found 22 studies between 2014 and 2019 that reported on many of them. Some had sensitivities and specificities pretty close to the ideal of 100. None are close to as large as this study, though.
Even blood pressure monitors, ubiquitous in physician’s offices, can screen for atrial fibrillation. A systematic review of them found that they had sensitivities greater than 85% and specificities greater than 90%.
Here’s the thing, though: Experts aren’t even sure if screening is a good idea to begin with.
After all, if we felt strongly enough about detecting asymptomatic people who might have atrial fibrillation, we could screen everyone with electrocardiograms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has considered doing this among adults 65 and older, who are at higher risk for stroke. The group found that the evidence was insufficient to recommend doing so, because it’s not clear that this level of screening is better than current care. Just taking a pulse as part of a checkup is a pretty good screen all by itself.
There is also a concern that electrocardiogram screening could turn up a lot of false positives, leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary further testing, which incurs its own risks. Remember that even with the Apple Watch, most of the people who got notifications did not have atrial fibrillation.
Moreover, the task force was focusing on a population where we might intervene: older people. Patients at high risk of stroke who have atrial fibrillation (i.e., older people) might be treated with anticoagulation. For younger ones at lower risk, it’s not immediately clear how we would treat them, or if we should.
And it’s younger people who are more likely to have a smartwatch.

Critic Picks Best Movies And Trends Of The 2010s

Texto completo: The DVD collection was the bookshelf of 2010.
If you were fortunate enough to have the means to buy movies at will, your collection would stretch to the ceiling, in neatly arranged rows. You’d sort titles by alphabetical order, or maybe by genre.
Flash forward a mere 10 years, and you’re liable to spot a DVD in the window of a resale shop, with a sticker pricing it for 50 cents.
It’s a streaming world.
In 2007, Netflix celebrated its billionth DVD delivery via the good old-fashioned U. S. Postal Service.
By 2010, Netflix was well on its way to dropping mail service like a cad drops the spunky lead in a dated rom-com.
By the spring of 2011, some 23 million Americans had signed up for a Netflix subscription service.
By 2018-2019, Netflix was not only offering popular “binge-watch” series, it had become a major player on the Hollywood scene, with “Roma” (2018) receiving 10 Academy Award nominations and winning three; the post-apocalyptic thriller “Bird Box” (2018) attracting a worldwide audience of 45 million viewers in its first week of streaming release; and Martin Scorsese’s Netflix Original film “The Irishman” drawing a huge viewership, garnering nearly unanimous critical acclaim and almost sure to receive a half-dozen or more Oscar nominations.
“The Irishman” was released in theaters on Nov. 1. The digital streaming premiere was less than a month later, on Nov. 27. “Marriage Story,” another major Oscar contender from Netflix, hit theaters on Nov. 6, with the digital streaming release coming just one month later.
The National Association of Theatre Owners is shaken to the core (and not without good reason) by this departure from the usual 72-day window for movies to play in theaters before digital platform release.
“It’s a disgrace” for “The Irishman” to have such a short and limited theatrical run, said the organization’s president, John Fithian, in an article in Variety. “(It’s) going to play on one-tenth of the screens it should have played on. ... (Netflix) is leaving money on the table.”
Maybe. What’s indisputable is that streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime (and newcomers such as Apple TV+ and Disney+) will continue to grow as providers of original movie content as well as ongoing TV-type series.
The emergence of the streaming content studios was one of the biggest seismic changes in the movie world in the 2010s. Let’s take a look at some of the other game-changing movie stories of the decade.
De-aging
Speaking of Netflix and “The Irishman,” Martin Scorsese couldn’t have made this 209-minute instant classic without the advancements in digital de-aging technology that allowed Robert De Niro (who is 76), Joe Pesci (76) and Al Pacino (79) to convincingly look like decades-younger versions of themselves.
We first saw de-aged characters in 2000s films such as “X-Men: The Last Stand” and “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.” The technology improved and looked less “computer-smooth” and more natural in films such as 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War” (with a key scene featuring a young Robert Downey Jr./Tony Stark) and “Captain Marvel” (with Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg de-aged some 25 years to fit the 1990s setting).
Wondrous as it is, the CGI technology is still hit-and-miss. The “young” Will Smith in “Gemini Man” looked like a combination of a motion-capture creation and a wax museum figure come to life.
The de-aging of De Niro et al. in “The Irishman” isn’t seamless, but it’s arguably the best yet. I’ve seen “The Irishman” twice, and on each occasion, it took about a half-minute to stop marveling over the de-aging technology and become immersed in the story.
Maybe the highest compliment one can pay to movie magic is when you’re too busy enjoying it to worry about how it’s done.
Superhero diversity
Five of the 10 yearly box-office champions of the 2010s were superhero movies, but the dawn of the era of the comic-book movie blockbuster came in the previous decade, which yielded three “Spider-Man” movies, four “X-Men” films and the debut of “Iron Man” in 2008.
However, it wasn’t until the latter part of this decade that we experienced truly historic gender and racial breakthroughs in the superhero movie universe.
“Wonder Woman” (2017) was a global smash hit (more than $820 million in worldwide grosses) AND a cultural sensation, with little girls the world over finding inspiration in this onscreen role model.
Two years later, “Captain Marvel” (with Brie Larson as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel) became the first female-led superhero movie to top $1 billion worldwide.
“Black Panther” (2018) was a generational game-changer, as the 18th film in the Marvel Universe became arguably the most important and impactful film in the Marvel Universe, with Chadwick Boseman as the first African American lead in the modern superhero movie era.
And the main character in the Oscar-winning animated feature “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” (2018) was Miles Morales, the first Afro-Latino lead in a superhero movie.
Oscar progress
In 2015, all 20 actors nominated for Oscars were white - the first time that had occurred since 1998.
Activist April Reign created the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag to raise awareness of the lack of diversity in Hollywood, and the viral buzz only intensified in 2016 when for the second year in a row, all 20 acting nominees were white.
But this was about so much more than the handing out of trophies. It was a reminder that minorities and females were underrepresented in every field of movie work: onscreen, behind the camera, at the executive level, you name it. (Spoiler alert: We still have a long way to go.)
Little wonder the membership of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences skewed white, male and older. (In 2016, 91% of Oscar voters were white and 76% were male.)
To its credit, the Academy has been following through on its 2016 pledge to increase the percentage of female and minority members. Half of the 2019 invitees were women, and 29% were people of color.
As for the Oscars ...
Yalitza Aparicio (“Roma”) was the first indigenous Mexican woman nominated for best actress. Mahershala Ali was named best supporting actor in 2016 for “Moonlight” and in 2018 for “Green Book,” making him the first African American actor to win twice in the same category. Viola Davis won best supporting actress of 2016 for “Fences,” and Regina King was awarded an Oscar in the same category two years later for “If Beale Street Could Talk.”
In other creative categories, the long overdue Spike Lee finally won his first competitive Oscar for his “BlacKkKlansman” screenplay; Jordan Peele (“Get Out”) became the first African American to win for best original screenplay; and “Moonlight” - you guys won!
This is not to suggest the playing field has been leveled and the #OscarsSoWhite era is no longer relevant. But positive strides have been made, and April Reign deserves a lifetime achievement award for her role in the movement.
Women heard
On Oct. 5, 2017, The New York Times published an article titled, “Harvey Weinstein Paid Off Sexual Harassment Accusers for Decades,” a devastating and surgically precise expose of the Hollywood mogul’s long history of making sexual advances and allegedly committing criminal acts of sexual abuse and misconduct.
About 10 days later, actress-activist Alyssa Milano picked up on a slogan originated by sexual harassment survivor Tarana Burke in the mid-2000s and tweeted, “If all the women who have ever been sexually harassed or assaulted wrote ‘Me Too’ ... we could give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem.”
This was the launching point for the #MeToo movement that initiated debate and discussion about widespread sexual discrimination in Hollywood.
On Oct. 29, 2018, The New York Times revisited the story and reported on the ripple effect, noting “#MeToo Brought Down 201 Powerful Men. Nearly Half Their Replacements Are Women.”
In 2019, you could compose a “Best Movies of the Year” list featuring only movies directed by women, from “The Farewell” (Lulu Wang) to “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood” (Marielle Heller) to “Little Women” (Greta Gerwig) to “Blinded by the Light” (Gurinder Chadha) to “Fast Color” (Julia Hart) to “Hustlers” (Lorene Scafaria) to “Harriet” (Kasi Lemmons) to “Queen & Slim” (Melina Matsoukas).
And yet when the Golden Globe nominations were announced, not a single female director was recognized in the film OR television categories. (New York Times headline: “Women Made Them. Viewers and Critics Liked Them. No One Nominated Them.”)

Best movies of the 2010s
Thanks to cutting-edge technology and Netflix treating a $140 million budget like your uncle handing out loose change he found in the car, Martin Scorsese was able to make “The Irishman.”
Thanks in large part to the #OscarsSoWhite and #MeToo movements, and the success of films such as “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther,” the door to equal opportunity behind and in front of the camera continues to push in the right direction.
The movie world still doesn’t accurately reflect the real world. But the image in the mirror is more promising than it was at the outset of this decade.
The 10 best movies of the 2010s
1. “The Social Network” (2010) - David Fincher’s brilliant retelling of the birth of Facebook is more relevant now than it was 10 years ago.
2. “Boyhood” (2014) - A classic 12 years in the making, with Richard Linklater and the cast reconvening once a year to tell the story of a boy becoming a man.
3. “Widows” (2018) - Steve McQueen’s near-perfect, Chicago-set thriller was one of the most criminally underappreciated films of the decade.
4. “The Irishman” (2019) - Scorsese. De Niro. Pesci. Pacino. Mobsters and Teamsters and fathers. Movie heaven.
5. “Mad Max: Fury Road” (2015) - George Miller, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron team up for one of the greatest action movies of all time.
6. “Room” (2015) - A beautiful, heartbreaking, melancholy, shocking, unforgettable cinematic poem about the unbreakable bond between mother and son.
7. “Moonlight” (2016) - Sometimes Oscar gets it wrong. Sometimes Oscar gets it right. With “Moonlight,” Oscar got it wrong AND then got it right.
8. “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” (2017) - Deeply moving, wickedly funny and consistently surprising.
9. “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood” (2019) - Quentin Tarantino’s love letter to his movie-saturated youth featured Brad Pitt’s career-best performance.
10. “American Hustle” (2013) - Sometimes, playing fast and loose with the facts in a “based on a true story” project can result in pure movie gold.

Texto completo: The Apple Watch has been quite successful as a smartwatch. The company would also like it to succeed as a medical device. The recently published results of the Apple Heart Study in the New England Journal of Medicine show there is still a long way to go.
An estimated 6 million people in the United States - nearly 2% - have atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat that brings increased risk of events like clots, heart attacks and strokes. It is thought that about 700,000 of the people with the condition don’t know they have it.
A selling point of the watch is a sensor that can monitor a wearer’s pulse and potentially detect atrial fibrillation.
A sizable study
To test the device’s ability to aid diagnosis, a group of researchers enrolled almost 420,000 Apple Watch wearers in a study. (Some of the researchers were Apple employees, and Apple sponsored the research.) Participants were monitored for about four months. Over that time, 2,161 of the study participants were notified of an irregular pulse, representing just over 0.5% of the sample.
Those people were offered telemedicine visits and, if their symptoms were mild, were offered electrocardiogram patches to wear for up to a week to help confirm a diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Participants mailed the patches back and, if the results indicated an emergency, were contacted immediately and instructed to receive care. If the results were positive for atrial fibrillation but did not require immediate medical attention, the participants were offered a second telemedicine visit and instructed to see their regular physician.
But only 450 of the 2,161 people who were notified about having an irregular pulse returned their sensor patches for evaluation. This means that among those who signed up for the study, wore the watch and got a health alert, almost 80% ignored it.
Of the 450 participants who returned patches, atrial fibrillation was confirmed in 34%, or 153 people. Those 153 are about 0.04% of the 420,000 participants.
This doesn’t mean that the Apple device failed. It probably led some participants to be diagnosed sooner than they might have. How many, and how much of a difference this made in their health, though, is debatable.
Many news outlets reporting on the study mentioned a result: a “positive predictive value” of 84%. That statistic refers to the chance that someone actually has the condition if he or she gets a positive test result.
But this result wasn’t calculated from any of the numbers above. It specifically refers to the subset of patients who had an irregular pulse notification while wearing their confirmatory patch. That’s a very small minority of participants. Of the 86 who got a notification while wearing a patch, 72 had confirmed evidence of atrial fibrillation. (Dividing 72 by 86 yields 0.84, which is how you get a positive predictive value of 84%.)
Positive predictive values, although useful when talking to patients, are not always a good measure of a test’s effectiveness. When you test a device on a group where everyone has a disease, for instance, all positive results are correct. A flipped coin would have a positive predictive power of 100% in such a population.
Limitations
Other test characteristics like sensitivity (if you have a disease, how likely the test is to be positive) and specificity (if you don’t have a disease, how likely the test is to be negative) are more effective in evaluating the overall quality of a test. This study, unfortunately, was not designed to determine those characteristics.
Other methods to screen and diagnose people with atrial fibrillation are available. A systematic review of mobile health devices for atrial fibrillation found 22 studies between 2014 and 2019 that reported on many of them. Some had sensitivities and specificities pretty close to the ideal of 100. None are close to as large as this study, though.
Even blood pressure monitors, ubiquitous in physician’s offices, can screen for atrial fibrillation. A systematic review of them found that they had sensitivities greater than 85% and specificities greater than 90%.
Here’s the thing, though: Experts aren’t even sure if screening is a good idea to begin with.
After all, if we felt strongly enough about detecting asymptomatic people who might have atrial fibrillation, we could screen everyone with electrocardiograms. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has considered doing this among adults 65 and older, who are at higher risk for stroke. The group found that the evidence was insufficient to recommend doing so, because it’s not clear that this level of screening is better than current care. Just taking a pulse as part of a checkup is a pretty good screen all by itself.
There is also a concern that electrocardiogram screening could turn up a lot of false positives, leading to misdiagnosis and unnecessary further testing, which incurs its own risks. Remember that even with the Apple Watch, most of the people who got notifications did not have atrial fibrillation.
Moreover, the task force was focusing on a population where we might intervene: older people. Patients at high risk of stroke who have atrial fibrillation (i.e., older people) might be treated with anticoagulation. For younger ones at lower risk, it’s not immediately clear how we would treat them, or if we should.
And it’s younger people who are more likely to have a smartwatch.

Texto completo: South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg raked in more than $24. 7 million in political contributions in the final quarter of 2019, bringing his total for the year to more than $76 million, his campaign announced Wednesday.
Buttigieg's campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl, said in a statement that 326,000 people contributed to the campaign in the fourth quarter with an average donation of $33. For the year, he said the campaign received contributions from more than 733,000 people. And of the more than $76 million raised in 2019, 98% was donations of less than $200, Schmuhl also said.
The totals for the mayor, whose last day in office is Wednesday, underscores his position as one of the leading candidates in the Democratic presidential primary. Buttigieg has consistently placed fourth in most recent national polls while also polling at or near in the top in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the 2020 primary season.
"These figures are even more astounding considering that Pete started this race less than a year ago as an unknown candidate, with just a few staffers and zero dollars in the bank," Schmuhl wrote in his memo announcing the fundraising totals.

More: Buttigieg leads 2020 rivals in Wall Street contributions
Buttigieg on the issues: The candidate tells us his thoughts on health care, immigration, gun control and more
"This quarter, Pete solidified himself as a top tier presidential candidate, not by tapping into the fundraising list or bank account of a sitting Senator or someone who had run for president before, but by speaking to voters who for too long have been let down by politicians in Washington and are looking for a better path forward," he wrote.
Candidates' fundraising totals are crucial in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 as the presidential hopefuls race to win over the remaining undecided voters with outreach and advertising.
Schmuhl said Buttigieg's resources have allowed him to open 35 offices with 100 organizers in Iowa and 65 offices with more than 500 staffers nationwide.
Buttigieg's fourth-quarter total reflected something of a rebound after raising just over $19 million in the previous quarter. While still a healthy total, that haul was a dip from the campaign's $24. 8 million second quarter that helped propel Buttigieg to the front of the large Democratic field.
Buttigieg is the first candidate to announce his fundraising total for the last quarter of 2019 ahead of the Jan. 31 filing deadline. But other campaigns have hinted at where they expect to end up.
With about $17 million raised, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is "a good chunk behind" where she was at the same point in the third quarter, when she brought in $24. 6 million, according to an email her campaign sent to supporters last week. Warren has also dipped in recent polls after topping former Vice President Joe Biden, who has consistently led the race, in some national surveys.
Biden's campaign said in an email that it expected to top the $21. 5 million it raised in the second quarter, according to The New York Times.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is expected to post an haul likely to top Buttigieg's total thanks to a huge number of small donations, The Times reported.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang's campaign told Fox News it expects to report a fundraising total of more than $12. 5 million, which would be at least a 25% increase from the third quarter of 2019.

Texto completo: In California, 2019 was quite a year.
Celebrities were caught in a college admissions scandal, planned power outages thrust hundreds of thousands into darkness during wildfires and two big earthquakes rocked cities in the southern parts of the state. New Gov. Gavin Newsom took action on more than 1,000 bills, pressed pause on executions and halted new fracking permits (after they surged on his watch). And that hardly scratches the surface.
So, for today's newsletter, we are diving into some of the biggest stories that we published last year and the important collaborations that helped us tell the California story and hold its leaders accountable.
But before we celebrate the year that brought us baby Yoda, let's revisit the decade we just closed out. The 2010s brought us planking and Tinder. We Gangnam Styled and Harlem Shook. There were times of unity, when millions took to streets to march for women’s rights (or to play Pokémon Go), and times of division — we all still remember whether we saw that dress as blue and black or gold and white (obviously #blackandblue btw). And, we carried on through it all.
In the past 10 years, there has been bad news and good, triumph and tragedy, and a whole lot of change. We even survived the end of the Mayan Calendar. What a decade. What a year.
I'm California Reporter Gabrielle Canon, filling in for Arlene Martínez. Get the latest headlines from across the state delivered straight to your inbox by signing up here (it's free!).
Gavin Newsom's first year as governor
It's hard to believe it's only been a year since Newsom took the helm as governor of the Golden State. In an exclusive year-end sit down with USA Today, he shared his hopes for the future, defended his dedication to taking on the Trump Administration, and championed a continued pursuit of the California dream — even as residents in the state face a myriad of new challenges to achieve it.
Newspapers collaborate to expose criminal cops
At the beginning of 2019, investigative reporters at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism got their hands on a list that showed an eye-popping number of current or former law enforcement officers, and applicants, who had been convicted of a crime. The result of a Public Records Act Request, the records — including the list with 12,000 names — didn't specify who was on the job. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office refused to help reporters parse through the list and even threatened legal action if they published the document.
Thus began an unprecedented collaborative effort that brought together reporters from three dozen newsrooms across California, including USA Today Network publications The Desert Sun, Ventura County Star, Redding Record Searchlight, Salinas Californian and Visalia Times Delta. The investigation exposed how more than 80 law enforcement officers currently working in the state broke the laws they are charged to enforce.
The review also found that one of every five officers kept their jobs or are still working more than a year after they were sentenced, and 630 cops were convicted during the last decade. Domestic violence was one of the most common charges, after DUI and serious driving offenses. The series was revelatory and showed just how much more there is to uncover. California has among the strictest secrecy laws on police records in the country.
You can search the database here, and find out more about how the project came together here.
Destined to burn
As the devastating Camp Fire ripped through the town of Paradise in 2018, escaping residents were caught in dangerous gridlock. The traffic jam in the town of 27,000 people contributed to the catastrophe — and it's one that is likely to be repeated in other high-risk California towns where the roads aren't equipped for a mass exodus when flames are moving fast.
This was just one of many stories produced as part of the Destined to Burn series, highlighting the lessons learned and risks remaining from California's worsening wildfires. The result of a collaboration between the USA Today Network, McClatchy, Media News, and the Associated Press, the series explored the urgent issues and California's unique wildfire risks.
From celery fields to college graduate at age 58
Adolfo González had spent years working the celery fields in Salinas. The 58-year-old came to California from a rural village in Mexico, speaking Zapoteco, his native language, and intended to support his mother and siblings. He never stopped learning. After long days working he went to school. He learned English, and it took him more than a decade, sporadically taking classes between harvesting seasons, but he earned a GED.
In 2019, González received his bachelor's degree in Spanish from California State University, Monterey Bay. He graduated with academic honors with plans to become a teacher and his hometown has rallied around him. Days before his credential test, Monterey County proclaimed June 11 "Adolfo González Day. "
"As I have said, I have done this for my family and my community, and myself, too," he said. "But I never imagined I can inspire this many people. " Read his inspiring backstory and how his hometown celebrated.
An ever-widening rich-poor gap
The California story is increasingly one of income inequality. Communities across the state have witnessed surges in street encampments, faced rising rents and experienced stark gaps between the rich and the poor. Many residents are struggling to survive in the state they have always called home.
Housing costs are roughly 2. 5 times the national average here, while more than a third of residents live in poverty. Roughly two-thirds of Californians said they'd tell young folks to lay down roots outside the state. The income gap in California is wide — and still growing.
In 2019, a statewide media collaboration assembled to tell the story of California's divide. Hosted by CalMatters, the series raises awareness about poverty, showcases local storytelling, and utilizes interactive tools and events to engage audiences.

Texto completo: Does it make sense that a person can burn an American flag with impunity but not a gay-pride flag? Earlier this month, a judge in Story County, Iowa, sentenced Adolfo Martinez to a preposterous 16 years in prison for swiping the rainbow flag from a nearby church and burning it in front of a strip club.
Mr. Martinez, 30, has a long criminal history, which partly explains the long sentence. He had two felony convictions, and Iowa law deems any three-time felon an "habitual offender," subject to enhanced sentencing. But a jury convicted Mr. Martinez of three misdemeanors—third-degree arson, for which the maximum penalty is two years in prison, along with third-degree harassment and the reckless use of fire, each subject to a maximum one-year term.
Mr. Martinez complicated his own defense by telling a local TV station that he had torched the flag because he didn't like gay people and had "burned down their pride, plain and simple." In response, the judge increased the misdemeanor arson charge to a hate-crime charge—a felony, normally carrying a maximum of five years in prison. So what seemed on its face to be a minor infraction suddenly became Mr. Martinez's strike three, inflating his five-year maximum to 15, plus an extra year for the reckless use of fire.
The absurdity of the sentence points up the larger absurdity of hate crimes as a class of criminal offense. Burning an American flag, the Supreme Court says, is free speech. The First Amendment allows you to register disapproval of the government in whatever expressive way you choose, though watch out for the arson laws. Calling the cops "pigs" or singing "F— da Police"? Also no problem, legally speaking. Unlike Canada, Europe and American colleges, the U.S. doesn't have "hate speech" laws.
The idea that free speech means free speech is a jewel of American exceptionalism. It's odious and moronic to deny the Holocaust, but it isn't—and shouldn't be—a crime. The New York Times didn't clutch its pearls when Hillary Clinton dismissed Donald Trump's supporters as a "deplorables" who are "irredeemable" and "not America." Nor did the guardians of correct opinion blanch when Barack Obama disparaged a large number of Americans as troglodytes clinging to their guns and religion. Rep. Ilhan Omar is entirely at liberty to explain away support for Israel as being "all about the Benjamins, baby." Robert De Niro is similarly free to give the finger to Mr. Trump and his supporters. All this is as American as apple pie, if less appetizing.
Designating an offense as a hate crime criminalizes not the action but the idea that supposedly impelled it. Here we are but a step away from the "thoughtcrime" George Orwell described in "1984."
Properly, the law should ask only two questions about your state of mind. First, do you have the faculty of reason that allows you to distinguish right from wrong? Second, did you intend to do the crime you committed? Beyond that, as James Madison repeatedly insisted, you have freedom of conscience. You can believe whatever you want, however politically incorrect—especially since today's political correctness may be deemed tyranny in retrospect. In a far-flung republic composed of various subgroups, multiple viewpoints and interests are bound to proliferate. Under such circumstances, toleration is required.
The New York area has experienced a rash of what Gov. Andrew Cuomo denounces as "hate crimes." Swastikas have been scrawled in largely Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods. Adolescent thugs have assaulted Hasidim on the streets. In mid-December three customers and a cop were murdered in an attack on a Jersey City, N.J., kosher market. On Saturday, a madman stabbed five people at the home of a rabbi in Monsey, N.Y., north of the city.
I abhor these offenses, but I don't see what is gained by Mr. Cuomo's apoplectic imprecations. These outrages don't presage pogroms, and it seems a fair bet that the perpetrators don't know what the Holocaust was. Did it matter to the victims whether their assailants attacked them to steal their money, express their hostility, or take advantage of their vulnerability? Surely the solution isn't relabeling but rather energetic and activist policing of the kind that discouraged violent acts by ill-socialized adolescents and street-dwelling crazies in New York for 20 golden years. Proactive policing also largely rid the streets of graffiti, offensive symbols included.
Let cops vigorously enforce existing laws against assault, harassment, vandalism, arson and the like. If the harassment amounts to an organized campaign of repression rather than random acts of delinquents or lunatics, then it's time to dust off the Reconstruction Era's antiterrorism laws. No group, whether Klansmen or members of an antifa mob, should be allowed to threaten or brutalize people.
It's a sad reflection on the failure of New York's current political culture, with its recent soft-on-crime legislation and abhorrence of common-sense policing, that ordinary people must think hard about the less appealing alternative of pressing for more teeth in the Supreme Court's Heller decision, upholding citizens' Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.

No fuss with friends

Texto completo: Setting up beautiful tablescapes, printing out menus or cards with guests’ names or, most importantly, anticipating their needs before they have them hasn’t been something that came naturally to me in adulthood.
Even before I became a mom, when I entertained — or, more specifically, “had people over” — the table was never set ahead of time, I never remembered to set out snacks, and I was usually still cooking (or just starting) when friends arrived.
But from messy kitchens came some memorable meals, like “the Ravioli-Off“ in college, where guests brought fillings and my co-host and I made the pasta dough. We spent all night making and eating ravioli until the entire kitchen was coated in flour.
During those years, my friend Emily started hosting Sunday brunches that showed me how a laid-back and low-key meal gathering could be. She usually had ingredients in the fridge when we rolled in, but we had a hand in everything, from making espresso to setting the table. And then after we finished our eggs Benedict, we’d lounge for hours poring over the New York Times.
We always had a good time, but the gatherings didn’t look like what Martha Stewart or Ina Garten suggested a dinner party could
or should be. Much has been made about millennials changing or reinventing dinner parties, rejecting some of the age-old norms of invites, seating arrangements, pre-meal cocktails and individually plated desserts. Or, you know, planning.
Alison Roman is at the forefront of this anti-dinner party dinner party. She’s the New York Times recipe developer known for such virtual hits as “The Stew” and “The Cookie.”
Her latest book, “Nothing Fancy,” is an homage to this no-fuss food party.
“Using your time and resources to feed people you care about is the ultimate expression of love,“ she writes. Showing that affection with food doesn’t require a big kitchen or a tablecloth with matching napkins or even a plan, really. Embrace the chaos and be flexible, and everything will turn out just fine.
To kick off 2020, another year in which I hope to cook for even more friends and be even less stressed about it, here are 10 tips I’ve learned about hosting a low-key dinner party.
1. Clean the kitchen and put away dishes the night before if you can, but at the very least, sweep. A clean floor makes the whole house look cleaner.
2. On the other hand, don’t apologize about your house, your kitchen or your menu. Getting real with your friends that you don’t lead a perfect life is part of opening your home to them, piles of dirty laundry and all. That’s a level of vulnerability in a friendship that makes it stronger.
3. Go easy on yourself when it comes to the food. Cook what you would make anyway or find a new recipe that isn’t too far outside of your comfort zone. A big pot of pasta or a slab of pizza is exactly what a fellow mom with two picky eaters wants to see on the table. Baked salmon with roasted broccoli, meatballs and hummus, a whole chicken. Prep anything you can ahead of time, if possible, such as “the Dip,” Roman’s favorite party starter.
4. Get specific about what people can bring. If you know the guest really wants to bring something, suggest a couple of options, one really specific and another general. Sometimes people can’t get the exact kind of parsley you need for a garnish but they are happy to hit the convenience store for wine.
5. Try to see dietary preferences with joy, not as burdens. If your guests eat a little differently than you because of, say, an allergy or picky kids, look at it as an opportunity to meet them where they are. A lactose-free friend invited me to a weeknight dinner at her house, and I offered to bring dessert. Without her allergy, I wouldn’t have sought out a chickpea blondie dessert that I’m now happy to have as part of my baking repertoire.
6. Ask for help when your guests arrive: setting the table, slicing cheese or bread, tearing greens, taking plates or bowls of food to the table. It gives them something to do to ease into the rhythm of your space.
7. Leave room for downtime at the beginning or at the end. It’s a rare treat to play a board game, listen to records or work on a puzzle with friends.
8. Sometimes, takeout is just fine. I have a family member who comes to visit for dinner a few times a year, and we always order takeout because we just have too much catching up to do and she has stronger preferences about what she’s in the mood to eat.
9. Don’t overdo it, but also don’t forget a snack. It’s hard to host even a low-key dinner party if you’re hungry and dinner’s not ready yet.
10. Pick your battles. Sometimes, that extra side dish just doesn’t come together in time or none of the kids can seem to sit still long enough to eat. Other times, you book a get-together with friends and you end up having to order a pizza. It’s the act of setting aside time to be with your people that makes these gatherings special. A willingness to laugh at your own mistakes and imperfections can go a long way, even after the party is over.
Labne With Sizzled Scallions and Chile (Almost Ranch)
Among some of my friends, this has become known as “the Dip,” and now I literally cannot attend any social gathering or host any dinner party without someone requesting “the Dip.” When you make it, you’ll know why. It’s my very high-brow version of ranch dressing, and that’s all the intel you need. But if you’d like to know more, there is a scalliony chile oil that gets sizzled with cilantro stems (or chives) and swirled into a thick, lemony labne. From there, I’m sure you can assume that the combination of tangy dairy, coupled with that herby chile oil, already sounds incredible, and maybe you are on your way to making this right now. If you can find green garlic, which tends to be hyper-seasonal and mostly found only at farmers markets, use them (or even ramps!) in place of the scallions. Serve with small boiled potatoes, vegetables, pita chips, potato chips and really anything you think will taste good dipped in a salty, slightly spicy, creamy dip!
Alison Roman
• 1/3 cup olive oil
• 4 scallions, white and green parts thinly sliced
• 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
• 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems)
• Flakey sea salt
• Freshly ground pepper
• 2 cups labne or full fat Greek yogurt or sour cream
• 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
Heat the olive oil, scallions, crushed red pepper flakes and cilantro in a small pot over medium-low heat. Cook, swirling occasionally, until the scallions and red pepper flakes start to visually and audibly sizzle and turn the oil a bright orange. Remove from heat and let cool enough to taste without burning your mouth, then season with salt and pepper.
Combine labne and lemon juice in a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Spoon into a bowl and swirl in the sizzled scallion mixture. Top with extra cilantro, if you like. Makes 2 cups.

Moroccan-spiced Chicken With Carrots and Olives
When you bake this dish, resist the urge to open the oven. The result is remarkably like what comes out of a tagine, a traditional Moroccan cooking vessel. This is a great way to use up preserved lemons, if you have them.
Mark Bittman
• 1 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled if you like
• 1 large onion, halved and sliced
• 3/4 cup pitted green olives
• 1 tablespoon ground cumin
• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
• 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
• Salt and pepper
• 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds)
• 2 lemons, halved
• 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
Heat the oven to 425 degrees and position a rack near the top. Cut the carrots diagonally into 1-inch pieces. Put them in a 9-by-13–inch baking pan and scatter the onion and olives on top.
Combine the cumin, cinnamon and turmeric in a small bowl with a generous sprinkle of salt and pepper; toss to combine. Sprinkle half the spice mixture over the vegetables. Put the chicken on top of the vegetables and rub all over with the remaining spices; turn them skin side up. Tuck the lemons here and there. Pour 3 cups water into the pan.
Transfer the pan to the oven and bake until the chicken skin is browned and crisp and the meat is no longer pink at the bone, 30 to 40 minutes. Garnish with the cilantro, and serve hot directly from the pan with a big spoon to get all the juices. Serves 4.

Brown Butter Sweet Potato Gnocchi With Sage, Spinach and Hazelnuts
Making gnocchi at home is the easiest thing ever, and homemade is so much better than store-bought. The toasted hazelnuts with the brown butter, savory fried sage and slightly spiced sweet potato gnocchi is pure perfection. And don’t worry — I added some spinach so you get your greens. This dish is comfort food that’s actually pretty good for you.
Molly Krebs
• 2 medium sweet potatoes
• 2 to 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
• 1 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed
• 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
• 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
• 2/3 cup whole-milk ricotta cheese
• 1 large egg, whisked
• 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
• 10 to 12 fresh sage leaves
• 4 cups baby spinach
• 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more as needed
• 1/3 cup unsalted, dry-roasted hazelnuts, coarsely chopped
• Black pepper, as needed
Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a small baking sheet with foil. Pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork several times and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for about 1 hour, or until the potatoes are soft and tender. Slice the potatoes in half and let them cool, then mash the flesh and discard the skins.
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg. Add the mashed sweet potatoes, ricotta cheese, and egg and mix until a dough forms. You may need to use your hands for this step.
Transfer the dough to a generously floured work surface and cut it into 4 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a long rope, about 3/4 to 1 inch thick, and cut each rope into bite-size pieces. Set the gnocchi aside. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat while you brown the butter.
Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Once the butter begins to bubble, 1 to 2 minutes, add the sage leaves and fry for 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until crispy, lowering the heat if the butter starts to get too brown. If the butter hasn’t developed brown bits after frying the sage, continue to whisk constantly until the butter develops a nutty aroma and brown bits on the bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Pour all of the brown butter into a small bowl except for 1 tablespoon.
Heat the reserved 1 tablespoon brown butter in the same pot over medium heat. Add the spinach and saute for about 1 minute, until the spinach is wilted. Season with a pinch of salt and black pepper. Set aside.
Add the gnocchi to the boiling water — you may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of your pot — and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until they float to the top. Drain the gnocchi and immediately add them to the pot with the spinach, and pour in the remaining brown butter. Toss to coat, then add the Parmesan cheese and hazelnuts. Stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with the fried sage leaves and extra Parmesan cheese on top. Serves 2 to 3.

Mahshi Cinnamon-Scented Tunisian Meatballs
Every Friday in the early afternoon before Shabbat arrived, my father and I would visit my grandmother, and she would serve us a traditional Tunisian lunch that consisted of couscous with soup and mahshi. I looked forward to those lunches as her mahshi meatballs were so juicy and flavorful. I miss my grandmother, I miss those Friday afternoons, and every time I make these, I send a blessing to her soul. These meatballs are traditionally served alongside couscous, and some like to squeeze fresh lemon juice on top.
Yaniv Cohen
• 1 pound ground turkey or beef
• 1 large onion, finely chopped
• 1 bunch cilantro, chopped (leaves only)
• 1/2 bunch parsley, chopped (leaves only)
• 4 eggs, divided
• 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
• 1/2 teaspoon turmeric
• 1 teaspoon salt
• Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
• 2 large slices day-old challah or crusty bread, soaked in water for 10 minutes
• 1 teaspoon harissa or tomato paste
• 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil, or more as needed
• 1 cup all-purpose flour
Place the ground turkey in a large bowl and add the onion. Squeeze the cilantro and parsley leaves to remove some of the liquid, and add to the bowl. Add 2 eggs, the cinnamon, turmeric, salt and pepper. Squeeze the excess water out of the bread and add to the mix. Work the mixture with your hands until thoroughly combined and set aside.
In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 eggs and the harissa and set aside. In a skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. If the oil doesn’t reach half the height of the meatballs, add more.
Create flat, oval-shaped meatballs with the turkey mixture. Place the flour on a plate or in a shallow bowl. Dip each meatball first in the flour, covering them fully. Then dip each into the egg and harissa mix and fry over medium-low heat for about 15 minutes, flipping halfway through.
Before serving, place the cooked meatballs on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. Makes 20 meatballs.

Asian-Glazed Sheet-Pan Salmon and Broccoli
It doesn’t get easier during the week (or any night, for the matter) than a sheet-pan dinner, aka all of your dinner components roasted together on a single baking sheet. To take this otherwise simple meal to the next level, we toss together a quick-yet-delicious marinade for the salmon with deeply flavored Asian ingredients — soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, garlic and ginger — plus lots of fresh mint and cilantro. You’ll have tender, flaky salmon and crispy broccoli in no time at all—and cleanup is a breeze, especially if you line the pan. If you like your broccoli extra crispy, start roasting the broccoli 5 minutes before adding the salmon.
Maria Lichty
• 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 1/3 cup soy sauce
• 1/4 cup hoisin sauce
• 1/4 cup honey
• 1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
• Grated zest and juice of 1/2 orange (about 2 tablespoons juice)
• 3 garlic cloves, minced
• 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
• 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
• 4 (6-ounce) boneless salmon fillets, 1 1/2 inches thick
• 1 large head broccoli, cut into bite-size florets
• 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
• 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
• 2 scallions (white and green parts), thinly sliced
In a medium bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, the soy sauce, hoisin, honey, mint, cilantro, orange zest and juice, garlic, ginger, sesame oil and pepper flakes. Reserve 1/3 cup of the marinade and set aside.
Place the remaining marinade in a zip-top freezer bag with the salmon fillets and seal, making sure the salmon is covered with the marinade. Marinate in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
Remove the salmon from the marinade and arrange the fillets on the baking sheet. Arrange the broccoli florets around the salmon, drizzle them with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Bake the salmon and broccoli for 15 minutes, until the broccoli is tender and the salmon is flaky (timing may vary depending on the thickness of your fillets), brushing or drizzling the salmon with the reserved marinade after 7 minutes of cooking. Garnish with the sliced scallions and serve immediately. Serves 4.

Clafoutis
This French cake bakes up around a layer of fruit, and almost any fruit will do, but cherries and plums are traditional. It’s ideal for a dinner party because it’s a hard-to-mess-up dessert that you can serve warm or at room temperature.
Addie Broyles
• 5 tablespoons of butter
• 4 eggs
• 2/3 cups of sugar
• 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
• 3/4 cups of flour
• 3/4 cups of heavy cream
• 3/4 cups of whole milk
• 1 pound of cherries
Heat the oven to 400 degrees and grease a 9-inch round cake pan with 2 tablespoons of the butter.
Melt the remaining 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over low heat. In a large bowl, combine the eggs, sugar and vanilla. Then add in the flour, cream, milk and melted butter.
Pour the batter into the baking dish, top with the cherries, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes. Let cool and sprinkle with powdered sugar if desired. Serves 4.

Chickpea Blondies
These blondies are gluten-free, vegan and dairy-free, making them a sweet treat for anyone with dietary restrictions. You can use a different kind of nut or seed butter and toss in some chocolate chips, nuts or dried fruit, if desired. Adding an egg to the batter will make it more cakelike, but not vegan.
Addie Broyles
• 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
• 1/2 cup all natural peanut butter (or almond butter)
• 1/3 cup pure maple syrup or agave nectar
• 2 teaspoons vanilla
• 1/2 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
• 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
• Coarse sea salt, for sprinkling
Heat oven to 350 degrees and spray 8-inch-by-8-inch pan with cooking spray.
Add all the ingredients to a food processor and pulse until batter is smooth. In a food processor, add all ingredients and process until batter is smooth. Add 1/3 cup of mix-ins, if using, and pulse once or twice to mix.
Use a rubber spatula sprayed with cooking spray to spread batter evenly in prepared pan, sprinkling any extra mix-ins on top, if desired.
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. The bars will continue to cook after you remove them, and they dry out easily, so err on the side of underdone.
Cool pan for 20 minutes on wire rack. Sprinkle with sea salt then cut into squares. Store in fridge for up to 5 days. Makes 16 bars.

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - On a Sunday afternoon, customers at a Géant Casino supermarket browsed the aisles and lined up to buy groceries. It was a typical shopping experience except for one thing: All the cashiers had gone home. Customers scanned items at automated checkout stations as security guards hovered nearby.
That the store was even open was unusual. French labor rules prohibit most shops from employing workers past 1 p.m. on Sundays. But as e-commerce and online giants like Amazon usher in an era of round-the-clock spending, retailers are amping up the use of automated cashiers to help them compete.
The move has caused an outcry in France, where Sundays are traditionally a rest day for workers and families. While self-checkout machines are often used alongside cashiers, labor unions say tilting toward fully cashierless operations threatens the French way of life by encouraging American-style consumerism and automation, putting thousands of jobs at risk.
"Sundays are sacred," said Patrice Auvinet, the head of the General Confederation of Labor union in Angers, a midsize city in western France. "If they change that, it will change French society."
Groupe Casino, the country's biggest supermarket operator, began testing Sunday-afternoon openings in August using only automated machines at the warehouse-sized supermarket in Angers. It has expanded the experiment to at least 20 other megastores around the country, igniting raucous protests.
Casino further riled unions recently by becoming the first supermarket chain in France to keep most of its stores open - including the one in Angers - on Christmas Day using only self-checkout machines. Casino said in a statement that it planned to do the same on New Year's Day, and that the move was an extension of how it was already operating on Sunday afternoons.
"We're in a very competitive environment," said Sébastien Corrado, the marketing director of Groupe Casino. "The internet doesn't have frontiers, so we need to adapt to new modes of consumption that let us stay in the game and be winners."
Ringing up more profit is especially important for Groupe Casino, which also operates supermarkets in South America and Asia. It is restructuring billions of euros of debt after its holding companies recently entered a form of bankruptcy protection.
At the Angers store, which employs 115 in a working-class neighborhood, Groupe Casino is having salaried employees clock out as usual at 12:30 p.m. on Sundays, then bringing in security guards, hired through another company, to keep the store open through evening.
Groupe Casino's huge supermarkets, like the one in Angers, employ thousands, often on urban outskirts with limited job opportunities. That first Sunday afternoon in August, 200 demonstrators converged on the Angers store, chanting angrily and accusing the company of taking a big step toward replacing employees.

Collins criticizes senators for prejudging the evidence

Texto completo: Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, criticized some of her Senate colleagues, including the majority leader, for appearing to "prejudge the evidence" in impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, becoming the second Republican senator to question Sen. Mitch McConnell's pledge to coordinate with the White House.
Impeachment rules require a simple majority vote, meaning McConnell, R-Ky., can afford to lose only four members of his conference if he is to set the parameters of a trial. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, another moderate with an independent streak, said last week that she was "disturbed" by McConnell's promise to work with the White House counsel to set the terms of the trial.
Both Murkowski and Collins also offered noncommittal positions on calling witnesses to an impeachment trial, which Democrats have pushed and McConnell has resisted. And both women questioned why the House did not go to court when administration officials ignored subpoenas. (Democrats, who control the House, have asserted that going to court to compel testimony from administration officials would take too long when the 2020 election is already in danger.)
"It is inappropriate, in my judgment, for senators on either side of the aisle to prejudge the evidence before they have heard what is presented to us, because each of us will take an oath, an oath that I take very seriously, to render impartial justice," Collins said in an interview with Maine Public Radio that was broadcast Monday. "That's what it says, impartial justice."
She specifically referenced remarks from McConnell, that he would take his cues from the White House, and from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, who openly supported the impeachment of the president.
"There are senators on both sides of the aisle, who, to me, are not giving the appearance of and the reality of judging this in an impartial way," she said, a sentiment she echoed in a separate interview with News Center Maine, a local television station.
With Collins and Murkowski doubting their leaders' approach, scrutiny will fall on independent-minded Republicans such as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and retiring Republicans such as Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who could force Republican and Democratic leaders to work out the terms of a trial the way they did in 1999 with the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
An aide to McConnell on Tuesday pointed to instances during the Clinton impeachment trial in which Clinton and his lawyers were in communication with Senate Democrats over proceedings.
Collins, who was in the Senate during that trial, has repeatedly refused to weigh in on the allegations that Trump abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress, citing the need to remain impartial. She told both news outlets that she had compiled a thick notebook with documents from the last trial and had pressed Senate leaders to adhere to the framework set in 1999.
Drawing on her experience from the Clinton trial, Collins also said she was "open" to hearing from witnesses during proceedings against Trump. Democrats, led by Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, have pressured McConnell to allow them to call members of the Trump administration to testify in a trial.
Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., one of his caucus's most vulnerable members, said in an opinion article published Monday in The Washington Post that "for Americans to have confidence in the impeachment process, the Senate must conduct a full, fair and complete trial with all relevant evidence regarding the president's conduct."
But while Schumer said in his opening proposal to McConnell that the issue of witnesses and documents should be determined before the trial begins, Collins said that she would prefer to wait to decide who specifically should be called.

Texto completo: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway's inbox makes abundantly clear how personally venomous local politics has become.
" 'Fat,' 'sick,' 'worthless,' 'gutless,' 'loser,' " she said, reciting some of the insults that have been leveled at her since becoming mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, in April.
She got a taste of the animosity during her campaign, when she was criticized on blogs and social media not for her plans for housing, stormwater management or transportation, but for not wearing makeup.
"People are angry, or afraid, and express themselves in mean ways," she said.
Rhodes-Conway is not alone in facing this type of abuse. As many as 79% of mayors in the United States report being the victim of harassment, threats or other psychological abuse, according to a recent study. Thirteen percent also reported instances of physical violence.
And one factor - gender - stood out above all others as a predictor of whether a mayor would be targeted. Using a statistical analysis that took into account factors like time in office, the researchers concluded that female mayors were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to experience psychological abuse and almost three times as likely to experience physical violence.
The study, published in the academic journal State and Local Government Review, and interviews with current and former mayors, lay bare today's harsh political climate, in which threats of violence over social media are constant and speaking out can be perceived as a political weakness.
"We're seeing more women get elected into political office everywhere at the same time that there are increasing threats against all public officials," said Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. "Men also face violence, but women face more and more types of violence."
And the ease of making threats on social media is driving the abuse, said Sue Thomas of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, lead author of the paper.
"Social media is absolutely toxic to women politicians. It's much more virulent to me as a woman than as an out lesbian," said Annise Parker, who was mayor of Houston for three two-year terms. "Remarks about the way I look, what I weigh or how I dress - aspects of femininity - escalate into threats of physical violence."
And when Karen Weaver made history in Flint, Michigan, by becoming its first female mayor - amid a burgeoning water crisis in 2015 - she believed that she would have more support to discuss the issues facing the city, she said.
On social media, she said, "They went after me like I wasn't a person and had no feelings or family."
In all, 16% of the 238 mayors who responded to the survey said their experiences of abuse had them thinking about leaving their office, suggesting that the toxic environment also threatens to scare off mayors who are interested in long careers and higher political office.
"Folks who have everything it takes to succeed, win an election and be a terrific public servant, that's why they say no," said Christopher Cabaldon, mayor of West Sacramento, California, since 1998. He added that on social media it's "open season on politicians and their families. It definitely warps what our local democracy looks like."
He said that he had been able to remain in office for more than two decades, in part, because he is single and has not faced the discomfort of having a spouse or relative attacked.
"People don't know it until they experience it," said Parker, who is now the chief executive of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which helps train candidates for office. "It doesn't keep people out, but it burns people out once they're in it."
For Heather McTeer Toney, the first woman and the youngest person, at 28, to serve as mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, the menace arrived in her mailbox, not her inbox.
The words were written on a yellow sheet of paper, torn off from a legal pad, in black, blue and red ink, and the ones that explicitly threatened rape were written in red. It was more disturbing in a way, she said, that someone took the time to write a letter and mail it.
"It's 15 years later, and I can still remember that," said McTeer Toney, who was also the first black person in the post. "Trust me, this is something that I want to forget."
Mark Barbee, 29, a restaurant server who leads Bridgeport, Pennsylvania, a city of 5,000 about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, said he received death threats after winning election in 2017. City Council meetings have been especially contentious. His proposal for an anti-discrimination policy only increased the ire directed at him.
Barbee, a gay African American, said that the difficult times - during which some supporters told him his advocacy was "not worth your life" - forced him to contemplate leaving office.
The survey also found that mayors who are younger, in strong chief executive systems and in larger cities were more likely to be affected by violence and abuse.
And then there is the political calculation that comes with speaking out about the abuse: Will the public be sympathetic to a mayor who is complaining?
"Politicians have an image to keep up," Krook said. "That's particularly hard for women. If you potentially show some weakness, people can really jump on that."
Many mayors seemed to have reluctantly accepted the abuse as part of serving in office but have come up with their own methods of coping.
Rhodes-Conway does not engage with the attacks that come over social media, but her office reads everything, she said. "If I were reading this every day, it would be just awful," she said. "I feel for mayors who have less of a staff or less of a filter. This is really painful."
Instead, she combats the barrage of nastiness by visiting coffee shops around the city, where she and her staff buy drinks for residents, many of whom arrive upset and talk for an hour. "Even when people disagree with me face to face, they are polite," she said.
Mayor Lovely Warren of Rochester, New York, said she went so far as to shut down her personal Facebook account for nearly three years.
"When you get into a fight with the pig, you get dirty, and the pig likes it," she said, paraphrasing advice given by her family.

Texto completo: AL-UYAYNAH, Saudi Arabia - Ghazi Al-Anazi and his business, Ghazi Tours, take up to 900 visitors a month on treks like one to a dry riverbed dotted with acacia trees north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
But he is confident those numbers are about to multiply, as Saudi Arabia begins to open itself up as a major tourist destination. The government recently began issuing tourist visas for the first time, a remarkable shift for a traditionally shuttered society.
And it goes far beyond that: Billions of dollars are being poured into vast tourism projects throughout the kingdom in a bid to shift the economy away from its dependence on the petroleum industry and the government jobs it finances.
Visiting Saudi Arabia has long been a difficult proposition for everyone except Muslim pilgrims going on the hajj and business travelers. For decades, historic sites have been largely ignored, and hotels and travel services were scarce outside major cities.
Unemployment among Saudi nationals is about 12%. But the government figures that the travel industry, which employs about 600,000 people, can be expanded to create up to 1 million more jobs, as the need for everything from drivers, chefs and guides to hotel managers and archaeologists expands.
The move toward tourism was devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 34-year-old chief policymaker, whose Vision 2030 program seeks to diversify the economy, draw in more outside investment and expand the private sector.
The Saudis are hiring international real estate executives and introducing elaborate advertising campaigns to try to put themselves on the map. Already, there are signs the push is paying off: Saudi hotel room sales in the first nine months of 2019 increased 11.8% from the same period last year.
But a question hanging over the whole initiative, some travel experts say, is how many people will want to visit an ultraconservative kingdom that's the subject of intense criticism over its treatment of dissenters and women, that restricts the use of alcohol and until recently barred unmarried couples from sharing rooms.
Referring to the vast golden vistas, "I call it the new yellow oil," said Amr Al Madani, the chief executive of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula, a region in the northwest part of the kingdom that is roughly the size of New Jersey.
Al-Ula includes the evocative ruins of an ancient city of carved rock tombs, called Mada'in Saleh. Like Petra, a popular tourist draw in southern Jordan, the city was built by the Nabataeans about 2,000 years ago.
The vast region has only 45,000 residents. There are some existing resorts, and France's Accor chain recently agreed to manage one. Madani is planning an investment of up to $20 billion, from a mix of public and private sources, to finance airport expansion, hotels and other facilities to accommodate up to 2 million visitors drawn to archaeological sites as well as food and cultural attractions.
An even more ambitious scheme is under construction on Saudi Arabia's western coast. The Red Sea project covers a remote area with 120 miles of coastline, more than 90 islands and extensive coral reefs that could one day be a diving and snorkeling paradise.

Texto completo: It's not easy to come up with a list of New Jersey's most influential food people of the decade. It's especially not easy when you consider how much innovation and how many changes took place over the past 10 years.
As the New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells recently noted, this decade has seen the rise of Instagram and consequently how chefs cook (make it Insta-worthy, chef!); the proliferation of small-plates (tapas, anyone?) and the increase of vegetarian and vegan diners (how do you like your Impossible burger, ma'am?). Let's not overlook the explosion of the farm-to-table, tail-to-snout movement; the mushrooming of the fast-casual restaurant, and the rapid growth of craft breweries and artisanal food.
But we, food reporters and editors of USA Today Network in New Jersey — read our bios at the end of this story — love a good challenge. To help us with this formidable task, also enlisted we turned to two trusted food lovers and avid restaurant-goers: Michael Sinatra, a Hoboken and Asbury Park resident who is vice president of communications for restaurants-discovery platforms The Infatuation and Zagat, and formerly with Whole Foods Market; and Vincent Barcelona, a River Vale resident and former restaurant chef-owner who today runs Vincent Barcelona Hospitality, a restaurant consulting business.
So, who are the women and men who made the greatest mark this decade on the ever-evolving, ever-expanding, ever-luscious dining landscape in New Jersey? Let's dig right in.
The Wizard | David Burke Ventanas, Fort Lee; David Burke at Orange Lawn, South Orange; Drifthouse by David Burke, Sea Bright; and Nauti Bar in Sea Bright
He may be one of America's most creative and innovative chefs — he has restaurants in New York, Washington, Sarasota Springs and Garden City, Long Island. But David Burke, a Fort Lee resident who began his admirable career in New Jersey (washing dishes at the Sheraton Hotel in his hometown of Hazlet), heads five restaurants in New Jersey with plans to add more Jersey spots to his portfolio in the years to come.
He made food Insta-friendly before Instagram even existed (seen his bacon hanging on a miniature clothesline?); he has won a handful of James Beard awards (including Best Chef New York — twice) and received the coveted Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplôme d'Honneur (the only American chef to do so). And now he is slowly growing an empire in his home state. "At my age, I don't need to fly all over the world," Burke told The Record earlier this year. "I can save three hours by staying in New Jersey." Besides, he said, "I'm a Jersey guy." A Jersey culinary wizard, we'd say.
The Mentor | Anthony Bucco Chef/Owner, Felina, Ridgewood
Matawan resident Anthony Bucco has wowed critics and diners alike with his cooking prowess in a slew of top-notch restaurants. He garnered a four-star review in 2012 in New Jersey Monthly for his cooking at the legendary Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station. Bucco also received ai guessn "Excellent," New York Times's highest rating, and AAA's coveted Four Diamond Award. Plus he got four stars from The Star-Ledger for his work at Stage Left Steakhouse in New Brunswick, Uproot in Warren and the Ryland Inn. And this year his modern Italian restaurant Felina was named by New Jersey Monthly one of the Best Restaurants in New Jersey.
Impressive? Yes. But perhaps even more impressive is how many chefs under his tutelage today are heading first-rate kitchens themselves. The list includes: J.R. Belt, executive chef at Stage Left Steakhouse and restaurant Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick; Jason Ramos, executive chef of the Pluckemin Inn in Bedminster; Martyna Krowicka, chef de cuisine, Felina; AJ Capella, executive chef, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown; David Viana, executive chef-partner, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge (see below); Aishling Stevens and Matt Laurich, executive chef and chef de cusine respectively, Crystal Springs Resort and Restaurant Latour, Hamburg; and Randy Forrester, who until recently was chef and owner of award-winning Osteria Radici in Allentown.
Says Bucco about his many prominent proteges: "These talented individuals did more to ensure their own success than I or anyone could have ever done for them. I am humbled to have had so many talented people share time in the kitchens I have had the luxury of overseeing. They own the success, not I." Talented and humble: a winning combination in life and the kitchen.
The Restaurateur | Chris Cannon Owner, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown
Once arguably the predominant restaurateur in New York City (his portfolio included Marea, Alto and Convivio), nearly six years ago Chris Cannon showed New York hotshots and New Jersey diffident food lovers what can be done on this side of the Hudson. Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, his magnificent,15,000-square-foot, four-restaurant compound in Morristown, was the first Garden State restaurant in 2015 to make Esquire's Best New Restaurant list in more than a decade. It also received a 3-and-a-half star review in New Jersey Monthly and was named by NJ.com as one of the "49 restaurants you need to eat at before you die."
Cannon, a proud Mountain Lakes resident and passionate wine lover, wants those across the river to know that dining (and boozing) on this side is pretty darn amazing. "New Jersey is so misunderstood, so maligned," Cannon told Esquire. "Three quarters of the stuff from the Union Square green market is coming from New Jersey. My staff, all the key guys, moved from the city out here." Feeling slightly cowed, NYC?
The Chef | Robbie Felice Chef/Owner, Viaggio, Wayne, and Osteria Crescendo, Westwood
Not yet 30 — he celebrated his 29th birthday two months ago — Robbie Felice, a Sussex native and a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has already shown North Jersey diners how awesome authentic Italian food tastes at his two award-winning restaurants: Viaggio in Wayne and Osteria Crescendo in Westwood.
Nowhere on his menu are such Italian-American dishes as chicken cacciatore, penne alla vodka, spaghetti and meatballs or garlic bread. Arancini, di Stefano Stracciatella, salmon oreganato, tagliatelle Bolognese, and tiramisu panna cotta are.
Felice cures his meats, hand rolls his pasta, makes most everything from scratch. In less than four years, he's shown New Jersey how darn good real Italian food can taste. Buon appetito!
The Pizzaiolo | Dan Richer Owner, Razza Pizza Artiginale, Jersey City
Seven years ago, Dan Richer, a Rutgers University grad, opened a BYOB pizza joint in Jersey City — and redefined the art of pizza making.
Says Michael Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Outside of sports gambling, Razza has maybe become the state's most successful new source of interstate commerce. Anyone who's been rants about the incredible bread, butter and pizza. But more importantly, Razza gives New Jersey the hammer that punches the final nail in the coffin of the debate of who does it better: NJ or NYC. Don't believe it? Just check out the people filing off the PATH train at Grove Street to get a taste of some of what's on a menu that pays tribute to purveyors in every corner of the state."
The Grill Master |Stephen Chrisomalis, Jr. Chef/Owner, Steve's Burgers, two locations, both in Garfield
Stephen Chrisomalis, Jr. may have learned how to butcher animals, clean and debone fish and julienne vegetables at the Johnson & Wales culinary school, but the Hackensack resident is happy, thank you very much, flipping burgers at his roadside stand, and equally humble second, similarly eponymous burger joint, in Garfield.
Not just any burgers, mind you. But, well, the best. Yelpers recently named Steve's Burgers one of 50 Best Burgers in America. Travel Channel's "Food Paradise" voted it the best in the tri-state area. And in 2018, it was named "Best Burger" at the Famous Food Festival in Jersey City. We second all those accolades, having named his patty Bergen's Best Burger this year.
CENTRAL The Mixologist | Jamie Dodge Reyna's, Barrio Costero and Laylow, Asbury Park
For too long, cocktail culture huddled in a few corners of the Garden State (Cheers, Jersey City! Cheers, Princeton!). But over the past 10 years, it has spilled over widely into just about every Jersey region.
Mixologist Jaime Dodge can take a chunk of credit for New Jersey's newfound cocktail zeal. The 35-year-old Long Valley native started his career seven years ago at Circa in High Bridge and went on to floor the press and cocktail lovers alike with his wildly creative potent potions at Elements, Princeton's revered fine-dine restaurant, and Mistral, its more casual sister restaurant.
Today he heads the drinks programs at three Asbury Park spots: Mexican restaurants Reyna's and Barrio Costero and newly opened cocktail lounge Laylow.
The press — and public — have taken notice. In a review of Barrio, New Jersey Monthly wrote: "(Executive chef) Anthony Bustamante is not Barrio's only star. Jamie Dodge ... has crafted Mexican-influenced cocktails that make Barrio's busy bar worth a visit on its own."
Recently, Dodge began concocting "off-the-wall" drinks in underground "killer lounge" Laylow that serves as his lab for experimentation. "I'm playing with more science," he says; his toys include foams, infusions, citrus acids — as well as homemade tonics, gins, colas and syrups. We can't wait to drink what he comes up with next.
The Sommelier | Susanne Wagner Wine Director, Restaurant Latour, Hamburg
German-born Susanne Wagner, wine director at Restaurant Latour, is arguably the most knowledgeable sommelier in the Garden State. She oversees one of the world's most exceptional wine collections, boasting more than 100,000 bottles.
Last year, The Wine Enthusiast Restaurant named Restaurant Latour to its Restaurant Hall of Fame, the only New Jersey restaurant to be given the honor. It is in stellar company; also inducted were such industry luminaries as Blue Hill at Stone Barns (Pocantico Hills, N.Y.) Eleven Madison Park (New York City) and The French Laundry (Yountville, Calif.).
And while New Jersey oenophiles rave about her — "She's amazing; hands down the best," declares Anthony Bucco, chef and owner of Felina in Ridgewood — her influence stretches beyond the borders of New Jersey. Among those she has trained are Samantha Shaw, today wine director of highly regarded seafood restaurant The Pearl in Nantucket, Mass.; Brent Jones, cellar sommelier at The French Laundry in Napa, Calif.; and Kenneth Belgard, who recently started working at The Modern in NYC.
The Partners in All Things Food | Neilly Robinson and David Viana Owner and Chef/Partner Respectively, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge
Three years ago, chef David Viana became a partner of six-year-old Heirloom Kitchen, a restaurant, retail boutique and cooking school founded by Neilly Robinson and housed in one gorgeous space in Old Bridge. And while the wonderfully talented chef has gotten lots of kudos — he was nominated for a James Beard award; was inducted into the Hall of Fame at his culinary alma mater, the Institute of Culinary Education; became one of 15 chefs to compete on Top Chef's 16th season — Robinson is no industry slouch.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "While David Viana's food is what has brought a level of notoriety to Heirloom Kitchen as a restaurant, Neilly Robinson's tireless work in developing a dedicated following for her best-in-class cooking school and connecting the state's most influential food suppliers together. From butchers in North Bergen to bakers in Asbury Park, oyster harvesters on the Barnegat Bay, local chefs, wine retailers, farmers and more, Neilly is an undeniable lynchpin that connects all things related to food in not only Monmouth County but throughout the state."
The Brewer | Michael Kane Founder, Kane Brewing Company, Ocean Township
Kane Brewing churns out lots of different beer, make that, lots of amazing artisanal, small-batch beers. Kane specializes in hoppy and barrel-aged beers that wisely take advantage of the Garden State's bounty. Founder and owner Michael Kane mixes such local ingredients as New Jersey honey and apple cider into his brews.
"We work with local farms to make culinary-inspired beers," says the 43-year-old Little Silver resident. The brewery's flagship beer Head High today is poured in at least 500 restaurants and bars in New Jersey.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Kane Brewing might not have been the first, but its success in the 2010s brought newfound levels of respect to the state's growing brewery community, as well as long lines to their brewery for one-of-a-kind and special beer releases."
The Sommelier | Francis P. Schott Co-owner and Beverage Director, Stage Left Steakhouse and Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick
In 1992, when Francis Schott and his business partner Mark Pascal opened Stage Left Steakhouse, hardly any restaurant in New Jersey was offering estate-bottled wines from small producers. Stage Left was. "Now everybody is doing it," said Schott, who is not only co-owner but beverage director of the restaurant. (He is beverage director for Catherine Lombardi, the duo's second restaurant, too.)
Thanks to Schott, Stage Left has won Wine Spectator's coveted Best of Award of Excellence every year since 2005. It has hosted some of the wine world's most luminary professionals, including Alexandra Cherniavsky, beverage director of The Love, an award-winning restaurant in Philadelphia, and Master Sommelier Johnathan Ross (ex-Eleven Madison Park guru; today a wine consultant in Australia). And it has introduced one of the first cocktail programs in the country. New York Times's drinks writer Robert Simonson features him in his book "A Proper Drink."
Says Schott, "We helped to change the way people drink wine and cocktails in New Jersey." A thank you is in order.
The Professor | Craig Shelton Co-Founder, Princeton Center for Food Studies, Princeton University
Craig Shelton, who has trained in eight of the world's greatest restaurants, including El Bulli, Jamin; Ma Maison and Le Bernardin, is one of only two New Jersey chefs to have ever received a James Beard Award (the other is Maricel Presilla, chef and owner of Cucharamama in Hoboken). The Bedminister resident also has received four New York Times four-star ratings, a five-star Forbes rating, the Relais & Châteaux Grand Chef title; and No 1. Top Restaurant in America in 2004 from GQ.
As many longtime Jersey food fans know, Shelton was the chef and owner of legendary haute-cuisine temple Ryland Inn until 2010. He was for a time the chef of a New Jersey diner (The Edison Diner), one that — surprise! — received a four-star review in The Star Ledger and the New York Times.
So what does an apparent awards magnet with more than 30 years of virtuoso cooking experience do at the pinnacle of his career? Teach — and think — about food, nutrition, agriculture, the environment ... and how they are related and can be made better.
In a statement, Shelton, who holds a degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from Yale, wrote that his mission is "to make great and healthy food available and affordable for all citizens of our great country." Shelton hopes to "help shift public opinion toward the demand for wholesome, nutritious and natural foods grown or raised holistically ... To bring fun and competency to the home cook and the professional culinarian ...To free culinary conventional wisdom from centuries of myth and false theory."
Recently, Shelton was awarded the New Jersey Restaurant Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. If only the Nobel Norwegian Committee gave a prize in food science.
The Teacher | Chris Mumford Former Chef/Owner, Mumford's Cafe, Tinton Falls
Chris Mumford was doing farm-to-table before it was the thing to do. He could see his garden from his restaurant window, where he also held cooking classes, teaching people they could make a beautiful meal from the food they grew in their backyards (the backyard of his own home was full of vegetables, too, as were the side yards and anywhere he could fit a pot). He has a passion for cooking unlike anyone most of us have seen, and chefs up and down the Shore hold him in the highest regard. He made cooking seem like something people could, and would want to, do.
(P.S.: After three decades of cooking, Mumford closed shop in mid-2018. But he left his cafe in good hands with chef Casey Pesce, who renamed it Apple Street Kitchen.)
The Chef | Bruce Lefebvre Chef/Owner, The Frog & the Peach, New Brunswick
Bruce Lefebvre has been cooking at what again and again many consider to be one of the state's best restaurants for some three decades. He was named executive chef in 2001, became the restaurant's owner in 2012. But don't expect to hear him boast.
"He is a very quiet, unassuming chef," says Vincent Barcelona, New Jersey-based restaurant consultant. Since Lefebvre won't toot his own horn, we thought we'd boast for him.
Lefebvre, Barcelona says, "has been impacting not only central New Jersey for the past decade with ever-evolving food, top-notch service, and a great wine program, but he has trained successful cooks that have gone on to have solid careers as chefs all over."
The Beer Expert | Mike Proske Owner, Project PUB and Tapastre, both in Somerville
For more than a decade, Mike Proske run Tapastre, a tapas-style restaurant that pairs dishes with its huge selection of craft beer. Project PUB is Proske's new venture, a brew pub that does a tap takeover every month at a brewery and offers a new menu designed to be paired with that brewery's beer. He also has hosted the town's Oktoberfest for the past few years, which has been called one of the best Oktoberfests in America, and has begun hosting a beer fest at Somerset Patriots Ballpark.
The Restaurateur | Steven Botta Owner, Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park; Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro; Feast Italian Kitchen in Old Bridge; and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse in Old Bridge
Monmouth County food enthusiasts have known for some time that Steven Botta, the executive chef and co-owner of the popular Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park and Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro, is a local authority on Italian cuisine. But earlier this year, Middlesex County residents learned it, too. Botta opened two restaurants in Old Bridge: Feast Italian Kitchen and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse. He gets credit too for resurrecting Fromagerie in Rumson after it was sold by chef David Burke (see above, North).
SOUTH The Rising Star, Valentina Fortuna Co-Owner/Chef, Constellation Collective, Collingswood
She may have grown up in nearby Haddon Heights, but Valentina Fortuna made her mark in Collingswood's competitive dining scene. With founding partners Maura Rosato and Lindsey Ferguson, she quickly saw Constellation's star rise.
Born first as a catering company and farmers market pop-up, and nurtured in an industrial Collingswood building, the from-scratch bakery and cafe is a magnet for food aficionados from both sides of the Delaware. Nashville Hot Chicken, housemade tacos and especially Constellation's famous Honey Pie bring them back for more.
In fewer than five years, the 32-year-old captured the Garden State Culinary Arts's 2018 Ring Star Chef Award.
The Sushi Veteran | Shigeru Fukuyoshi Sagami, Cherry Hill
Sushi is everywhere from the hibachi chains to the supermarket, but Fukuyoshi remains the master.
The 74-year-old chef hasn't stopped producing some of the best raw-fish dishes at his no-frills restaurant. He honed his skills in a New York City restaurant five decades ago and brought sushi to South Jersey in 1974. Any wonder that Fukuyoshi's knives have Philadelphia chefs and celebrities frequently cross the Delaware to get their chopsticks around his sushi?
Fukuyoshi has watched as sushi spots have proliferated across the landscape, but he remains the standard-bearer: In 2017, Sagami was nominated for Outstanding Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation Awards.
The Neighborhood Star | Joey Baldino Chef/Owner, Zeppoli, Collingswood
Whether he ever lands that James Beard Best Chef Award, this eight-time nominee is confident in his Sicilian-inspired cooking and his 35-seat humble BYOB restaurant in Collingswood. From the carefully curated Sicilian-style antipasto platter to the cloud-like ricotta gnocchi to the savory rabbit stew, no meal at Zeppoli is easily forgotten.
Baldino is the chef most frequently cited as the best of the best in the southern half of the state, and can claim credit for making the borough a formidable food destination. (His annual Sicilian-style backyard barbecues sell out in mere minutes.)
This unassuming chef also owns the members-only Palizzi Social Club in South Philly, and recently put out his first cookbook, drawing from his family's history and the menu there. But he can frequently be found manning his open kitchen and chatting with guests on the Jersey side.
The Culinary Phoenix | Jim Malaby Chef/Owner, blueplate, Mullica Hill
When Jim Malaby's then 14-year-year-old restaurant caught fire in August 2018 after costly renovations, the chef and owner didn't despair. He brought it back one year later, bigger and better.
A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Malaby once worked at Philadelphia's well-known four-star restaurant Brasserie Perrier, owned by George Perrier.
The Mullica Hill resident set the pace for other South Jersey chefs who wished to apply the "farm-to-fork" label. He works closely with farmers, incorporating their harvest into his seasonal fare. Malaby also was an early adapter to offering menu items for those with dietary restrictions.
The relaunch of blueplate and its comfort food, with both New American and French influences, was met with gratitude in a region of South Jersey without a lot of dining options.
The Locavore | Todd Fuller Chef, Farm & Fisherman Tavern, Cherry Hill
The last 15 years have seen the rise of the eat-local, farm-to-fork movement throughout the culinary world, but few chefs take it to heart like Todd Fuller, chef/partner at this Cherry Hill mainstay.
This relaxed yet sophisticated restaurant and tavern was launched by Cherry Hill residents Colleen and Josh Lawler in 2013, the second iteration of their Philly BYOB (a 2012 James Beard nominee for Best New Restaurant). In partnership with Fuller and mixologist Danny Childs, they champion sustainable, regional produce and proteins and offer one of the most ambitious farm-to-bar cocktail menus in the region.
Fuller is a master of nose-to-tail cooking, aims for a zero-waste kitchen and is a frequent partner of the Courier-Post in its #WasteNot efforts to combat food waste in New Jersey.
The Natural | Phil Manganaro Chef/Owner, Park Place Cafe & Restaurant, Merchantville
From foraging for wild blueberries, morels and maple syrup to making his own sea salt, baking his own rustic breads, and preparing from-scratch-made pastas and classic French dishes, Phil Manganaro runs a tiny restaurant that is very much a one-man show, one that critics love.
Guests to Park Place can reserve a seat in the kitchen and watch Manganaro work his magic or relax in the small dining room, where they will be treated to vinyl records, dozens of photos of Pinelands flora and fauna, and a perfect cup of espresso.
In a glowing three-star review two years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer's restaurant critic wrote, "Park Place Cafe is the best excuse to pay a $5 toll I've found in years."
The Multi-Restaurant Operator | The PJW Restaurant Group The PJW Restaurant Group, headquartered in Haddon Township, revolutionized casual dining in South Jersey, first with the PJ Whelihan mini-chain (find one in Cherry Hill, Haddon Township, Maple Shade, Medford Lakes and Washington Township), but also The Pour House, Treno Pizza Bar and Central Taco & Tequila (all in Westmont). Today it has nine restaurants in Southern Jersey and more across the bridges.
PJW Assistant Culinary Director Jacqueline Platzer was recognized by the Garden State Culinary Arts Awards for her part in creating PJW's core and seasonal menus.
The Newcomers | Dominic and Lindsay Piperno Owners, Hearthside BYOB, Collingswood
When the Pipernos opened Hearthside in Collingswood in 2017, they did what you might think was impossible. Their New Jersey restaurant quickly began racking up "Best New Restaurant in Philadelphia" accolades, including from Food & Wine. Among their other early honors was a Best New Restaurant nomination from Bon Appetit and a Garden State Culinary Arts Award for Best New Restaurant in the state.
With its hearth as a focal point, an evolving seasonal menu and impeccable service, Hearthside gets raves from all quarters, and is easily the hardest-to-land reservation in South Jersey. Chef Dominic Piperno leads the kitchen, while Lindsay's vision inspires front of house.
The couple has announced plans to open a wine bar nearby, and South Jersey eagerly awaits whatever comes next from this team.

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes.
The critically acclaimed new movie "Marriage Story," described by its co-star Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood. The bestselling new novel from Taffy Brodesser-Akner, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," tells a similarly bleak marriage story.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
But the story of the death of marriage has been greatly exaggerated. There is good news to report about our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the past decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the past decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. Scholars predict that the rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, offering their children a better shot at a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, non-marital childbearing is down. Since 2009, the rate of non-marital childbearing has fallen from 41% to 39.6% in 2018.
We think what's happened, in part, is that young adults have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upward, after bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents.
What does all this mean? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compar-ed with children born into other fam-ily forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educa-tional, social and psychological outcomes.
All of this is good news for our children. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.

Texto completo: Dilla's Delights, a Detroit doughnut shop opened in 2016 to honor the memory of hip hop artist J Dilla, announced ambitious plans to reopen in a new spot and to do it the business is seeking $15,000 in public contributions through the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe.
As of early Tuesday, the effort had raised more than $6,000, mostly from small donations of $5 and $10. So far, the largest donation was $1,000.
Messages left at the shop at 242 John R. were not immediately returned, and a report from mid-December said that shop was expected to reopen after the New Year on Friday. But it's unclear from the GoFundMe appeal whether that plan had changed.
"Hi, my name is Herman Hayes. Some people affectionately call me Uncle Herm," the GoFundMe pitch begins, explaining that he is the uncle of James Yancey, aka J. Dilla and Jay Dee. One of the rapper's last albums was named "Donuts," and the shop, Hayes said, was an homage to it.
Hayes, a longtime baker in his 60s — who previously worked for Dawn Donuts, the former Flint-based doughnut chain — opened his shop more than three years ago in the Ashley Building at the corner of John R and Centre Street across from the Detroit Opera House.
When Hayes opened the shop, he was making 10 to 15 doughnut varieties himself from 100% organic flour out of the Avalon International Breads commercial kitchen but planned on opening his own kitchen near Eastern Market.
He also received considerable local media attention, with Hayes touting specialties with Detroit names, such as the D-Lime-nut, instead of Key Lime doughnut, and Brewster's banana pudding doughnut, named after the former Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects in Detroit.
However, Hayes' recent appeal for help adds that he recently battled cancer and is in recovery. As a result, he says in the pitch, the shop's hours were cut, then closed "for more than a month" and ultimately fell behind on its bills.
"The goal of $15,000 will update, repair, and replace equipment used heavily for four years," he writes. "It will aid in our search for a future home, provide project renderings, and secure the legal aid needed to move forward with ease."
Hayes is guarded about where a new shop would go, writing that the shop is "in negotiations with properties for a larger space to produce and sell our donuts and merchandise with room for seating and a museum. One potential site comes with enormous historic magnitude."
He also mentions that he hopes to get grants, partners, and investors to create a "historical landmark and Detroit tourist attraction," but there are no details in the appeal about what a museum would highlight or what would make the new shop a sightseeing destination.
And the pitch also clarifies that the shop is separate from J Dilla's estate and nonprofit J Dilla Foundation with this disclaimer: "We are an independent entity and do not receive funds or assistance from any other entity which bears the name J Dilla or James Yancey."
When J Dilla died in Los Angeles at age 32, he was memorialized on publications nationwide, including the Free Press, Los Angeles Times and New York Times. News reports said he suffered from lupus, an autoimmune disease that led to multiple complications, including kidney failure and cardiac arrest.
J Dilla was survived by two daughters, who are pictured in the GoFundMe appeal.
The Free Press called the Detroit native "a champion of Detroit's urban music scene, and in the mid-'90s, when hip-hop was dominated by the East and West coasts." J Dilla, the report said, inspired artists like Eminem and D12 and "put a distinct Motor City sound on the national map."

Texto completo: In 2019, news from the Central Coast made waves in the national media.
From a Shawshank-style jailbreak to a former Salinas farmworker who graduated college at 58, here are some of the highest-profile stories covered in the last year.
A farmworker who persevered In May, the story of Adolfo González's graduation from CSUMB at age 58 quickly spread far beyond the Salinas Valley.
The former farmworker dropped out of school at 12 to help support his family before moving to the U.S. He grew up primarily speaking Zapoteco, an indigenous language in Mexico, but later learned Spanish and English. Over several decades, he slowly but surely conquered obstacles and continued his education, earning his GED diploma before attending Hartnell College and California State University Monterey Bay.
After he walked across the CSUMB stage in May, surrounded mostly by graduates less than half his age, he flashed a big smile and two thumbs up. He plans to continue his education so that he can become a teacher.
After The Salinas Californian wrote about González and his accomplishment, the story quickly went viral as readers shared the initial Facebook post more than 10,000 times.
The Monterey County Board of Supervisors later honored Gonzalez with his own day, and his story continued to grow across the Internet.
¡Despierta América!, Univision's morning show for Spanish speakers in the U.S., interviewed him on live television. He also spoke with the world's fourth-largest news wire service and the largest for Spanish language, Agencia EFE. The New York Times and Los Angeles Times featured González's original story from The Californian in their California newsletters.
In the United States' second largest media market per Nielsen ratings, KTLA also reported on González. The news station has the largest audience in Los Angeles. His story was also featured on Latino news site remezcla.com
"Like my dad always says, this just got out of hand – way too much," his daughter Marie said. "We never thought he would get such recognition. We always thought only the family would be happy, would be excited. But it seems like the whole community is excited for him, and motivated."
Doorbell licker He's facing only trespassing and petty theft charges, but many across the United States have seen his face.
Roberto Daniel Arroyo, then 33, engrossed the nation after he was caught on a Ring doorbell camera liberally using his tongue on a Salinas home's doorbell intercom button.
He also allegedly stole extension cords, and walked into and out of frame over the course of about three hours.
The footage aired in early January on an episode of LivePD, a reality television show that accompanies law enforcement as they respond to calls.
Arroyo caught the nation's attention span, surprising even the residents of that home.
"They were just (saying), 'You've got to be kidding me,'" David Dungan, then 67, said days after LivePD broadcast the video.
His wife published it on social media because they wanted to alert the community, especially neighbors who have young children, Dungan said.
They also cleaned the porch and bleached the doorknobs, he said. The incident garnered national attention and quickly inspired the hashtag #doorbelllicker on Twitter.
At least one neighbor also told police he'd heard a knock at his door early that Saturday morning.
Police contacted Arroyo two days afterward; however, there wasn't enough evidence then to arrest him.
Arroyo's previous case had ended with him declared unable to stand trial due to his mental state. He was sent to Atascadero State Hospital.
He was released several months prior to the doorbell video and has not appeared in court on several property crime cases filed against him in Monterey County Superior Court.
The Scottish street musician Kim Gordon had a problem: He was facing about two dozen charges of rape and similar crimes in Scotland, law enforcement has said.
Astonishingly, though, he died just days before he was due in court to face these charges after taking a trip across the pond to swim and surf in Carmel's Monastery Beach.
Or, at least, that's what he wanted everyone to think, Monterey County Sheriff's Cmdr. John Thornburg has said.
Gordon, who has several aliases, was hoping law enforcement believed he'd gone for a swim at a notoriously deadly beach and been lost to the Pacific.
They did not.
"There was a lack of detail," said Thornburg at the time. "The son, who reported it, couldn't even tell us where he went in under the water."
Gordon's son also couldn't easily explain how he got from the Los Angeles airport to Monterey County, nor could deputies find any witnesses on the beach or otherwise who had seen the missing man.
"We don't think he went swimming and got in trouble," said Thornburg in a March 2 Californian article. "We think it's more related to trying to get out of the charges."
Authorities spent more than 20 hours searching for him in the area.
But that's not where they found him.
Instead, Gordon was arrested in Colorado Springs, Colo. months later. There, he was identified as Kim Vincent Avis, 55, by law enforcement. He also went by Ken Gordon-Avis and was extradited back to Scotland.
"He has used several names Kim or Kem and Avis and Gordon," wrote Chris Macrae, with the communications department of the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.
"A date for the full trial was set for 20 March 2020," Macrae wrote. "The trial to be heard at the High Court in Edinburgh."
In addition to the rape and sexual assault charges, he also faces a charge of failing to appear in court in Scotland, Macrae said.
According to a Scottish newspaper, Gordon had worked as a street musician.
Salinas police don a charro suit During Big Week, Salinas police made big news as they wore charro-inspired police uniforms to patrol the 2019 California Rodeo Salinas.
It was the first time the Salinas Police Department incorporated the ornate navy blue charro suits sporting the Salinas Police Department's badges on the sleeves. The outfit also included police star badges as well as a white and silver sombrero.
The idea, dreamed up by Officer Gabe Carvey, was meant to represent and honor the Salinas community, in a city where more than three-quarters of residents are Latino.
Police officers typically wear American garb of Wrangler jeans, cowboy boots and Stetson hats to the California Rodeo Salinas.
Images of the two officers wearing the suits quickly made the rounds on social media as people far from Salinas cheered on the effort to better connect with the majority-Latino community's constituents.
After the Salinas Police Department posted images to Facebook, the photos received more than 1,500 responses and close to 700 shares, all overwhelmingly positive.
The story was soon picked up by the Associated Press, appearing in publications across the country such as The New York Times. The Los Angeles Times also quickly followed up with their own story on the charro suits, giving Salinas another spotlight on the national stage.
There are plans to make male and female charro police suits, and the police department plans to reserve them for special community occasions.
"We're going to recognize, by wearing this charro suit, we're validating our community's heritage and culture," said Salinas Police Chief Adele Fresé. "And we're going to demonstrate that we value the rich history of the people we're sworn to protect and serve."
Playboy model turned killer One story that put Salinas in the national spotlight didn't occur on the Central Coast or even California.
It's a complex story that involves a former Playboy Italia model and her boyfriend allegedly killing a Salinas psychiatrist who'd paid her rent, her family's rent and her lease for a 2017 Mercedes-Benz C300.
Former Salinas resident Kelsey Turner as well as Jon Logan Kennison and Diana Pena were charged with killing Dr. Thomas Burchard, who was found bludgeoned to death March 7 in the trunk of that Mercedes-Benz in a remote desert area outside of Las Vegas.
After authorities discovered his remains, they launched a manhunt for all three individuals, who were arrested in Nevada and California.
Turner and Kennison have pleaded not guilty and their cases are pending. Pena, a Caesar's Palace bartender, pleaded guilty to being an accessory to murder and provide testimony in the case, detailing what allegedly happened to Burchard.
Burchard, whose partner estimated he'd given Turner about $300,000 in gifts and in-kind help in the two years he'd known her, was attacked at Turner's four-bedroom Puritan Avenue home, which he'd paid the rent for, according to court documents.
Burchard had been staying at the home in the bedroom of Turner's son, who was spending the night with a friend, when the assault happened.
Turner had become concerned Burchard would discover she was dating Kennison, according to Pena's testimony.
She became enraged at "pornographic" messages between Burchard and her mother and threatened to report Burchard to the Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where he worked, Pena testified.
The fight escalated with Burchard locking himself in the bedroom until Kennison kicked in the door in and beat Burchard.
According to Pena's testimony, Kennison allegedly beat Burchard again after he refused to get into the car with Turner and Kennison. They had said they were taking him to the hospital, which he believed to be a ruse so they could kill him elsewhere, Pena said.
After he was dead and abandoned, Pena said she helped Kennison and Turner clean up blood spatter in the home to make it seem as though they'd abruptly abandoned it. Then, they went to a motel and on their separate ways until they were eventually all arrested.
Nevada prosecutors have declined to seek the death penalty.
Turner and Kennison's cases are scheduled for a status conference Feb. 4, according to the Clark County District Court's online records.
Shawshank-style jailbreak At 8 a.m. Nov. 3, Monterey County Sheriff's Deputy Jesus Ortega Tejeda was counting Monterey County Jail inmates in a jail housing unit that he'd only worked a few times prior in his then two months with the sheriff's office.
There were supposed to be nine inmates.
There were only seven.
That set off a frantic manhunt for accused killers Santos Fonseca, 21, and Jonathan Salazar, 20, who had allegedly committed three unrelated murders on behalf of rival gangs.
Three days after their escape, which made national news, both men were back in the custody of the sheriff's office after trying to cross into the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro border crossing, deputies have said.
Salazar's mother has said he returned because he was worried about the effect the escape and its attention was having on her.
Deputies have not said why the pair returned, although prosecutors said Salazar used his name at the crossing, and Fonseca used at least his first name.
The pair had escaped by cutting and entering a hole in the sheet rock and stucco ceiling of a communal jail bathroom, slinking through an 11-inch maintenance gap and breaking out of a hatch into a construction area where fences obscured cameras, deputies have said.
Monterey Sheriff's Cmdr. John Thornburg described it as an escape reminiscent of "The Shawshank Redemption," a movie about a man creating a hole in his prison cell and sneaking out to freedom.
Fonseca and Salazar spent at least a day knocking the hole in the ceiling with a "hard-plastic" cleaning brush, authorities have said.
Their path to Mexico from there is unclear, although sheriff's deputies have said they believed at least one of the men had been spotted at the Marina Motel 6 in Marina, causing an hours-long standoff, deputies have said.
Both men's murder trials are pending. Fonseca is accused of killing two men with the help of his girlfriend, Alexandra Romayor, who previously pleaded out.
Salazar is facing one count of murder in an unrelated case. His preliminary hearing on the escape allegations is pending.

'Same God' is still her creed Professor rebuilding life after hijab controversy

Texto completo: On the first day of Larycia Hawkins' political science classes at the University of Virginia, she steps to the front of the classroom and gives a little speech.
It's not about the syllabus. It's about her unintended, uncomfortable fame.
"I say, 'OK, if you Google my name, there's a New York Times story about me,'" Hawkins says. "And I tell students that if you are curious about what I think about issues, here are a lot of articles about it online."
Some students will have read about their professor's 2015 battle with her previous academic home, prominent Christian liberal arts school Wheaton College, in suburban Chicago.
Others might not be aware that Hawkins has been the subject of an intense controversy that swept through the evangelical Christian community and cost her her job and tenure at Wheaton. Or that her story is the subject of a documentary, "Same God," which began airing Dec. 13 on PBS.
"The further we get out from the job that I left," she says, "it's easier. But one of the things it has changed is how I introduce myself on the first day."
In December 2015, Hawkins had decided to pursue "embodied solidarity" with Muslims by wearing a hijab during Advent, the Christian season leading up to Christmas. She posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing a hijab, along with words that stated her solidarity with Muslims because "they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God."
"I didn't think, I don't think, I was doing anything radical," Hawkins says.
Wheaton disagreed, and questioned whether her "same God" statement contradicted the statement of faith that all Wheaton professors must sign as a condition of employment. Hawkins, a devout, lifelong Christian, found herself defending her theological views and, eventually, agreeing to resolve the conflict by leaving the school in February 2016. Along the way, she had become the subject of heated debate among evangelicals.
Filmmaker Linda Midgett, who began working with Hawkins on "Same God" in early 2016, says, "I can't overstate how much this turned Larycia's life upside down. I think what people fail to think about is the way that her life was uprooted for years. And she didn't know she was risking all that when she made that Facebook post."
Even more troubling, Midgett says, "she lost her anonymity, the pleasure of being a private citizen who isn't judged by people who don't know you."
"It's hard on my relationships with friends and family," Hawkins says, "because I'm experiencing mental trauma and anxiety and depression that come and go."
Hawkins began a life of shuttling back and forth between Virginia, where she initially landed a one-year fellowship at UVA's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Chicago.
Hawkins, who is African American, began her journey in Oklahoma, where she grew up steeped in the traditions of the black Christian church. Though politics were not an overt part of her church life, she says, themes of the civil rights movement and social justice ran deep in her family. "Those things were never far or distant from our memory or our home," she says. "A lot of these lessons were taught, some of them were just there."
At Wheaton, Hawkins' experience of the practice of faith was juxtaposed with traditions that lean more heavily on white evangelical experiences. Though Wheaton College is proud of having one of the first black college graduates in Illinois in 1866, in 2013 Hawkins became the first-ever black woman to be given tenure at the school. It wasn't always an easy position to be in. "There was a level of discomfort about the notion that the same Jesus could lead a person reared in that black church tradition to think one way about an issue," says Hawkins, "whereas white evangelicals might think quite differently about the same issue."
Midgett, who became close with Hawkins during the filming of the documentary, understands different interpretations of faith. Her own religious tradition springs from the white evangelical church, her family is still very much a part of that world and she is a Wheaton alumna. "I have some strained relationships from having done the film," she says, "because there was definitely pressure to not do it."
Once she saw how polarizing Hawkins' stance had become within the evangelical community, she says, she felt she had to tell the story. "I think something so important is going on here, even more important than what happened to Larycia." Midgett believes that the evangelical movement "is at a critical point" in its relationship to political power. "It is a difficult time," she says, "because the majority of white evangelicals right now, the platform that they have is antithetical to a lot of Christianity, in my opinion. I say this as somebody with relatives and close friends who have those beliefs. These are people I love who I strongly disagree with. It's hard."
The filmmaker finds herself defending Hawkins' "same God" statement, over and over. "I continue to see people who have decided in their minds that she is conflating Christ and Islam," Midgett says. "And they're completely wrong, that's not what she was saying and not what that statement means. It's important to understand what it means, and the intent."
As the film grapples with the dissonance between the principles of Christianity and the response to Hawkins' gesture, Hawkins is also shown coming to terms with the part race and sex played in the outcome. She was supported by many colleagues on the faculty, and several of them - all men - speak freely in the film about racism and their issues with the way Hawkins was treated. "They are in a different position as men at the college," says Midgett. "And that's a reality. It was very difficult for me to get women to go on camera."
Though the film throws political and religious divisions into sharp relief, Hawkins says that her aim for its impact remains much the same as her aim for that original Facebook post. "I hope it brings people closer together," she says. "My favorite showings have been where I can see the body language of people relax over time, because they allowed themselves to stay in the conversation. I'd like to think those people left with a greater understanding about embodied solidarity."

Texto completo: It's not easy to come up with a list of New Jersey's most influential food people of the decade. It's especially not easy when you consider how much innovation and how many changes took place over the past 10 years.
As the New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells recently noted, this decade has seen the rise of Instagram and consequently how chefs cook (make it Insta-worthy, chef!); the proliferation of small-plates (tapas, anyone?) and the increase of vegetarian and vegan diners (how do you like your Impossible burger, ma'am?). Let's not overlook the explosion of the farm-to-table, tail-to-snout movement; the mushrooming of the fast-casual restaurant, and the rapid growth of craft breweries and artisanal food.
But we, food reporters and editors of USA TODAY NETWORK in New Jersey love a good challenge. To help us with this formidable task, also enlisted we turned to two trusted food lovers and avid restaurant-goers: Michael Sinatra, a Hoboken and Asbury Park resident who is vice president of communications for restaurants-discovery platforms The Infatuation and Zagat, and formerly with Whole Foods Market; and Vincent Barcelona, a River Vale resident and former restaurant chef-owner who today runs Vincent Barcelona Hospitality, a restaurant consulting business.
So, who are the women and men who made the greatest mark this decade on the ever-evolving, ever-expanding, ever-luscious dining landscape in New Jersey? Here are some of them, with an emphasis on the Shore area.
The Wizard | David Burke Ventanas, Fort Lee; David Burke at Orange Lawn, South Orange; Drifthouse by David Burke, Sea Bright; and Nauti Bar in Sea Bright
He may be one of America's most creative and innovative chefs — he has restaurants in New York, Washington, Sarasota Springs and Garden City, Long Island. But David Burke, a Fort Lee resident who began his admirable career in New Jersey (washing dishes at the Sheraton Hotel in his hometown of Hazlet), heads five restaurants in New Jersey with plans to add more Jersey spots to his portfolio in the years to come.
He made food Insta-friendly before Instagram even existed (seen his bacon hanging on a miniature clothesline?); he has won a handful of James Beard awards (including Best Chef New York — twice) and received the coveted Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplôme d'Honneur (the only American chef to do so). And now he is slowly growing an empire in his home state. "At my age, I don't need to fly all over the world," Burke said earlier this year. "I can save three hours by staying in New Jersey." Besides, he said, "I'm a Jersey guy." A Jersey culinary wizard, we'd say.
The Mentor | Anthony Bucco Chef/Owner, Felina, Ridgewood
Matawan resident Anthony Bucco has wowed critics and diners alike with his cooking prowess in a slew of top-notch restaurants. He garnered a four-star review in 2012 in New Jersey Monthly for his cooking at the legendary Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station. Bucco also received ai guessn "Excellent," New York Times's highest rating, and AAA's coveted Four Diamond Award. Plus he got four stars from The Star-Ledger for his work at Stage Left Steakhouse in New Brunswick, Uproot in Warren and the Ryland Inn. And this year his modern Italian restaurant Felina was named by New Jersey Monthly one of the Best Restaurants in New Jersey.
Impressive? Yes. But perhaps even more impressive is how many chefs under his tutelage today are heading first-rate kitchens themselves. The list includes: J.R. Belt, executive chef at Stage Left Steakhouse and restaurant Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick; Jason Ramos, executive chef of the Pluckemin Inn in Bedminster; Martyna Krowicka, chef de cuisine, Felina; AJ Capella, executive chef, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown; David Viana, executive chef-partner, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge (see below); Aishling Stevens and Matt Laurich, executive chef and chef de cusine respectively, Crystal Springs Resort and Restaurant Latour, Hamburg; and Randy Forrester, who until recently was chef and owner of award-winning Osteria Radici in Allentown.
Says Bucco about his many prominent proteges: "These talented individuals did more to ensure their own success than I or anyone could have ever done for them. I am humbled to have had so many talented people share time in the kitchens I have had the luxury of overseeing. They own the success, not I." Talented and humble: a winning combination in life and the kitchen.
The Pizzaiolo | Dan Richer Owner, Razza Pizza Artiginale, Jersey City
Seven years ago, Dan Richer, a Rutgers University grad, opened a BYOB pizza joint in Jersey City — and redefined the art of pizza making.
Says Michael Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Outside of sports gambling, Razza has maybe become the state's most successful new source of interstate commerce. Anyone who's been rants about the incredible bread, butter and pizza. But more importantly, Razza gives New Jersey the hammer that punches the final nail in the coffin of the debate of who does it better: NJ or NYC. Don't believe it? Just check out the people filing off the PATH train at Grove Street to get a taste of some of what's on a menu that pays tribute to purveyors in every corner of the state."
The Mixologist | Jamie Dodge Reyna's, Barrio Costero and Laylow, Asbury Park
For too long, cocktail culture huddled in a few corners of the Garden State (Cheers, Jersey City! Cheers, Princeton!). But over the past 10 years, it has spilled over widely into just about every Jersey region.
Mixologist Jaime Dodge can take a chunk of credit for New Jersey's newfound cocktail zeal. The 35-year-old Long Valley native started his career seven years ago at Circa in High Bridge and went on to floor the press and cocktail lovers alike with his wildly creative potent potions at Elements, Princeton's revered fine-dine restaurant, and Mistral, its more casual sister restaurant.
Today he heads the drinks programs at three Asbury Park spots: Mexican restaurants Reyna's and Barrio Costero and newly opened cocktail lounge Laylow.
The press — and public — have taken notice. In a review of Barrio, New Jersey Monthly wrote: "(Executive chef) Anthony Bustamante is not Barrio's only star. Jamie Dodge ... has crafted Mexican-influenced cocktails that make Barrio's busy bar worth a visit on its own."
Recently, Dodge began concocting "off-the-wall" drinks in underground "killer lounge" Laylow that serves as his lab for experimentation. "I'm playing with more science," he says; his toys include foams, infusions, citrus acids — as well as homemade tonics, gins, colas and syrups. We can't wait to drink what he comes up with next.
The Partners in All Things Food | Neilly Robinson and David Viana Owner and Chef/Partner Respectively, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge
Three years ago, chef David Viana became a partner of six-year-old Heirloom Kitchen, a restaurant, retail boutique and cooking school founded by Neilly Robinson and housed in one gorgeous space in Old Bridge. And while the wonderfully talented chef has gotten lots of kudos — he was nominated for a James Beard award; was inducted into the Hall of Fame at his culinary alma mater, the Institute of Culinary Education; became one of 15 chefs to compete on Top Chef's 16th season — Robinson is no industry slouch.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "While David Viana's food is what has brought a level of notoriety to Heirloom Kitchen as a restaurant, Neilly Robinson's tireless work in developing a dedicated following for her best-in-class cooking school and connecting the state's most influential food suppliers together. From butchers in North Bergen to bakers in Asbury Park, oyster harvesters on the Barnegat Bay, local chefs, wine retailers, farmers and more, Neilly is an undeniable lynchpin that connects all things related to food in not only Monmouth County but throughout the state."
The Brewer | Michael Kane Founder, Kane Brewing Company, Ocean Township
Kane Brewing churns out lots of different beer, make that, lots of amazing artisanal, small-batch beers. Kane specializes in hoppy and barrel-aged beers that wisely take advantage of the Garden State's bounty. Founder and owner Michael Kane mixes such local ingredients as New Jersey honey and apple cider into his brews.
"We work with local farms to make culinary-inspired beers," says the 43-year-old Little Silver resident. The brewery's flagship beer Head High today is poured in at least 500 restaurants and bars in New Jersey.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Kane Brewing might not have been the first, but its success in the 2010s brought newfound levels of respect to the state's growing brewery community, as well as long lines to their brewery for one-of-a-kind and special beer releases."
The Sommelier | Francis P. Schott Co-owner and Beverage Director, Stage Left Steakhouse and Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick
In 1992, when Francis Schott and his business partner Mark Pascal opened Stage Left Steakhouse, hardly any restaurant in New Jersey was offering estate-bottled wines from small producers. Stage Left was. "Now everybody is doing it," said Schott, who is not only co-owner but beverage director of the restaurant. (He is beverage director for Catherine Lombardi, the duo's second restaurant, too.)
Thanks to Schott, Stage Left has won Wine Spectator's coveted Best of Award of Excellence every year since 2005. It has hosted some of the wine world's most luminary professionals, including Alexandra Cherniavsky, beverage director of The Love, an award-winning restaurant in Philadelphia, and Master Sommelier Johnathan Ross (ex-Eleven Madison Park guru; today a wine consultant in Australia). And it has introduced one of the first cocktail programs in the country. New York Times's drinks writer Robert Simonson features him in his book "A Proper Drink."
Says Schott, "We helped to change the way people drink wine and cocktails in New Jersey." A thank you is in order.
The Professor | Craig Shelton Co-Founder, Princeton Center for Food Studies, Princeton University
Craig Shelton, who has trained in eight of the world's greatest restaurants, including El Bulli, Jamin; Ma Maison and Le Bernardin, is one of only two New Jersey chefs to have ever received a James Beard Award (the other is Maricel Presilla, chef and owner of Cucharamama in Hoboken). The Bedminister resident also has received four New York Times four-star ratings, a five-star Forbes rating, the Relais & Châteaux Grand Chef title; and No 1. Top Restaurant in America in 2004 from GQ.
As many longtime Jersey food fans know, Shelton was the chef and owner of legendary haute-cuisine temple Ryland Inn until 2010. He was for a time the chef of a New Jersey diner (The Edison Diner), one that — surprise! — received a four-star review in The Star Ledger and the New York Times.
So what does an apparent awards magnet with more than 30 years of virtuoso cooking experience do at the pinnacle of his career? Teach — and think — about food, nutrition, agriculture, the environment ... and how they are related and can be made better.
In a statement, Shelton, who holds a degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from Yale, wrote that his mission is "to make great and healthy food available and affordable for all citizens of our great country." Shelton hopes to "help shift public opinion toward the demand for wholesome, nutritious and natural foods grown or raised holistically ... To bring fun and competency to the home cook and the professional culinarian ...To free culinary conventional wisdom from centuries of myth and false theory."
Recently, Shelton was awarded the New Jersey Restaurant Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. If only the Nobel Norwegian Committee gave a prize in food science.
The Teacher | Chris Mumford Former Chef/Owner, Mumford's Cafe, Tinton Falls
Chris Mumford was doing farm-to-table before it was the thing to do. He could see his garden from his restaurant window, where he also held cooking classes, teaching people they could make a beautiful meal from the food they grew in their backyards (the backyard of his own home was full of vegetables, too, as were the side yards and anywhere he could fit a pot). He has a passion for cooking unlike anyone most of us have seen, and chefs up and down the Shore hold him in the highest regard. He made cooking seem like something people could, and would want to, do.
(P.S.: After three decades of cooking, Mumford closed shop in mid-2018. But he left his cafe in good hands with chef Casey Pesce, who renamed it Apple Street Kitchen.)
The Chef | Bruce Lefebvre Chef/Owner, The Frog & the Peach, New Brunswick
Bruce Lefebvre has been cooking at what again and again many consider to be one of the state's best restaurants for some three decades. He was named executive chef in 2001, became the restaurant's owner in 2012. But don't expect to hear him boast.
"He is a very quiet, unassuming chef," says Vincent Barcelona, New Jersey-based restaurant consultant. Since Lefebvre won't toot his own horn, we thought we'd boast for him.
Lefebvre, Barcelona says, "has been impacting not only central New Jersey for the past decade with ever-evolving food, top-notch service, and a great wine program, but he has trained successful cooks that have gone on to have solid careers as chefs all over."
The Restaurateur | Steven Botta Owner, Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park; Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro; Feast Italian Kitchen in Old Bridge; and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse in Old Bridge
Monmouth County food enthusiasts have known for some time that Steven Botta, the executive chef and co-owner of the popular Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park and Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro, is a local authority on Italian cuisine. But earlier this year, Middlesex County residents learned it, too. Botta opened two restaurants in Old Bridge: Feast Italian Kitchen and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse. He gets credit too for resurrecting Fromagerie in Rumson after it was sold by chef David Burke (see above, North).
The Neighborhood Star | Joey Baldino Chef/Owner, Zeppoli, Collingswood
Whether he ever lands that James Beard Best Chef Award, this eight-time nominee is confident in his Sicilian-inspired cooking and his 35-seat humble BYOB restaurant in Collingswood. From the carefully curated Sicilian-style antipasto platter to the cloud-like ricotta gnocchi to the savory rabbit stew, no meal at Zeppoli is easily forgotten.
Baldino is the chef most frequently cited as the best of the best in the southern half of the state, and can claim credit for making the borough a formidable food destination. (His annual Sicilian-style backyard barbecues sell out in mere minutes.)
This unassuming chef also owns the members-only Palizzi Social Club in South Philly, and recently put out his first cookbook, drawing from his family's history and the menu there. But he can frequently be found manning his open kitchen and chatting with guests on the Jersey side.
The Newcomers | Dominic and Lindsay Piperno Owners, Hearthside BYOB, Collingswood
When the Pipernos opened Hearthside in Collingswood in 2017, they did what you might think was impossible. Their New Jersey restaurant quickly began racking up "Best New Restaurant in Philadelphia" accolades, including from Food & Wine. Among their other early honors was a Best New Restaurant nomination from Bon Appetit and a Garden State Culinary Arts Award for Best New Restaurant in the state.
With its hearth as a focal point, an evolving seasonal menu and impeccable service, Hearthside gets raves from all quarters, and is easily the hardest-to-land reservation in South Jersey. Chef Dominic Piperno leads the kitchen, while Lindsay's vision inspires front of house.
The couple has announced plans to open a wine bar nearby, and South Jersey eagerly awaits whatever comes next from this team.

Texto completo: When I was a Jewish kid growing up in suburban Los Angeles, we thought being Jewish meant supporting Israel.
There really wasn't a choice. If you identified as Jewish, as I and most of my friends did, the religious education we got, the youth groups we joined, and the summer camps where we played were all grounded in one thing.
It wasn't God - it was Zionism, the political project of settling Jewish people in Israel.
We never asked - and no one ever taught us in Sunday school - who had already been living on that land, long known as Palestine, when European Jews arrived around the end of the 19th century and started building settlements there.
My own break with Zionism came in my mid-20s, after reading the letters of Zionism's founder, Theodor Herzl, imploring Cecil Rhodes, the leader of British land theft in Africa, to support his work in Palestine. Their projects were both "something colonial," Herzl assured Rhodes.
Today, younger Jews are asking hard questions at earlier ages, and more of them have been actively critical of Israel in its assaults on Palestinians and Palestinian rights.
When the Trump White House says that criticizing or boycotting the state of Israel is anti-Semitic and issues an executive order that aims to shut down criticism of Israel on college campuses, many Jewish students aren't buying it.
One 20-year-old Jewish student and Hillel member at the University of North Carolina told The New York Times that she worried the executive order "falsely equates anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism" and is targeted at eliminating criticism of Israel.
Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and adviser, claims that the executive order is intended to make sure that Jews are protected by the Civil Rights Act's "prohibition against discrimination based on race, color, or national origin."
He says that the executive order does not define Jews as a nationality, but he goes on to proclaim that "anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism." This formulation essentially labels Jews - along with Palestinians and all others - who don't support Zionism as anti-Semitic.
Jews come in all races, colors and ethnicities. The Trump/Kushner view is an insidious way of claiming that Jews are all somehow linked to or accountable to Israel. That charge of "dual loyalty" is one of the oldest anti-Semitic canards around.
Of course, even as the Trump administration tries to silence criticism of Israel, real anti-Semitism is rising, especially during the Trump administration. We know what it looks like.
Anti-Semitism looks like the attack on a synagogue outside San Diego. It looks like Pittsburgh, where the alleged Tree of Life synagogue killer accused Jews of "bring(ing) invaders in that kill our people" by supporting resettlement of refugees. It looks like Klansmen and Nazis shouting "Jews will not replace us" in Charlottesville, Virginia.
That virulent anti-Semitism doesn't come from supporters of Palestinian rights.
It comes from the violent white supremacists operating increasingly publicly and proudly across the United States. Those same anti-Semites are still reveling in the support of the president, who called them "very fine people" after Charlottesville.
Real anti-Semitism is also coming directly from the White House itself - from a president who tells Jewish Republicans that he doesn't expect their support because he doesn't need their money, who invites to a White House Hanukkah party a Christian pastor who says Jews who don't convert to Christianity "are going to hell," and who asserts that Jews will "have to vote for me, you have no choice" because Democrats are proposing tax hikes on millionaires and billionaires.
Trying to suppress criticism of Israel even as Israel's government becomes ever more repressive of Palestinian rights won't work, especially when the White House itself is surrounded by anti-Semitism. Jewish and other progressive student groups are already asserting their intention to fight against the denial of free speech.
Likewise, insisting that anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism doesn't make it true. A new generation of young Jews - and a whole bunch of us who aren't so young anymore - know that's wrong.
Phyllis Bennis is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies and serves on the national board of Jewish Voice for Peace.

Texto completo: AL-UYAYNAH, Saudi Arabia - Ghazi Al-Anazi and his business, Ghazi Tours, take up to 900 visitors a month on treks like one to a dry riverbed dotted with acacia trees north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
But he is confident those numbers are about to multiply, as Saudi Arabia begins to open itself up as a major tourist destination. The government recently began issuing tourist visas for the first time, a remarkable shift for a traditionally shuttered society.
And it goes far beyond that: Billions of dollars are being poured into vast tourism projects throughout the kingdom in a bid to shift the economy away from its dependence on the petroleum industry and the government jobs it finances.
Visiting Saudi Arabia has long been a difficult proposition for everyone except Muslim pilgrims going on the hajj and business travelers. For decades, historic sites have been largely ignored, and hotels and travel services were scarce outside major cities.
Unemployment among Saudi nationals is about 12%. But the government figures that the travel industry, which employs about 600,000 people, can be expanded to create up to 1 million more jobs, as the need for everything from drivers, chefs and guides to hotel managers and archaeologists expands.
The move toward tourism was devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 34-year-old chief policymaker, whose Vision 2030 program seeks to diversify the economy, draw in more outside investment and expand the private sector.
The Saudis are hiring international real estate executives and introducing elaborate advertising campaigns to try to put themselves on the map. Already, there are signs the push is paying off: Saudi hotel room sales in the first nine months of 2019 increased 11.8% from the same period last year.
But a question hanging over the whole initiative, some travel experts say, is how many people will want to visit an ultraconservative kingdom that's the subject of intense criticism over its treatment of dissenters and women, that restricts the use of alcohol and until recently barred unmarried couples from sharing rooms.
Referring to the vast golden vistas, "I call it the new yellow oil," said Amr Al Madani, the chief executive of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula, a region in the northwest part of the kingdom that is roughly the size of New Jersey.
Al-Ula includes the evocative ruins of an ancient city of carved rock tombs, called Mada'in Saleh. Like Petra, a popular tourist draw in southern Jordan, the city was built by the Nabataeans about 2,000 years ago.
The vast region has only 45,000 residents. There are some existing resorts, and France's Accor chain recently agreed to manage one. Madani is planning an investment of up to $20 billion, from a mix of public and private sources, to finance airport expansion, hotels and other facilities to accommodate up to 2 million visitors drawn to archaeological sites as well as food and cultural attractions.
An even more ambitious scheme is under construction on Saudi Arabia's western coast. The Red Sea project covers a remote area with 120 miles of coastline, more than 90 islands and extensive coral reefs that could one day be a diving and snorkeling paradise.

Texto completo: On the first day of Larycia Hawkins' political science classes at the University of Virginia, she steps to the front of the classroom and gives a little speech.
It's not about the syllabus. It's about her unintended, uncomfortable fame.
"I say, 'OK, if you Google my name, there's a New York Times story about me,'" Hawkins says. "And I tell students that if you are curious about what I think about issues, here are a lot of articles about it online."
Some students will have read about their professor's 2015 battle with her previous academic home, prominent Christian liberal arts school Wheaton College, in suburban Chicago.
Others might not be aware that Hawkins has been the subject of an intense controversy that swept through the evangelical Christian community and cost her her job and tenure at Wheaton. Or that her story is the subject of a documentary, "Same God," which began airing Dec. 13 on PBS.
"The further we get out from the job that I left," she says, "it's easier. But one of the things it has changed is how I introduce myself on the first day."
In December 2015, Hawkins had decided to pursue "embodied solidarity" with Muslims by wearing a hijab during Advent, the Christian season leading up to Christmas. She posted a photo of herself on Facebook wearing a hijab, along with words that stated her solidarity with Muslims because "they, like me, a Christian, are people of the book. And as Pope Francis stated last week, we worship the same God."
"I didn't think, I don't think, I was doing anything radical," Hawkins says.
Wheaton disagreed, and questioned whether her "same God" statement contradicted the statement of faith that all Wheaton professors must sign as a condition of employment. Hawkins, a devout, lifelong Christian, found herself defending her theological views and, eventually, agreeing to resolve the conflict by leaving the school in February 2016. Along the way, she had become the subject of heated debate among evangelicals.
Filmmaker Linda Midgett, who began working with Hawkins on "Same God" in early 2016, says, "I can't overstate how much this turned Larycia's life upside down. I think what people fail to think about is the way that her life was uprooted for years. And she didn't know she was risking all that when she made that Facebook post."
Even more troubling, Midgett says, "she lost her anonymity, the pleasure of being a private citizen who isn't judged by people who don't know you."
"It's hard on my relationships with friends and family," Hawkins says, "because I'm experiencing mental trauma and anxiety and depression that come and go."
Hawkins began a life of shuttling back and forth between Virginia, where she initially landed a one-year fellowship at UVA's Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, and Chicago.
Hawkins, who is African American, began her journey in Oklahoma, where she grew up steeped in the traditions of the black Christian church. Though politics were not an overt part of her church life, she says, themes of the civil rights movement and social justice ran deep in her family. "Those things were never far or distant from our memory or our home," she says. "A lot of these lessons were taught, some of them were just there."
At Wheaton, Hawkins' experience of the practice of faith was juxtaposed with traditions that lean more heavily on white evangelical experiences. Though Wheaton College is proud of having one of the first black college graduates in Illinois in 1866, in 2013 Hawkins became the first-ever black woman to be given tenure at the school. It wasn't always an easy position to be in. "There was a level of discomfort about the notion that the same Jesus could lead a person reared in that black church tradition to think one way about an issue," says Hawkins, "whereas white evangelicals might think quite differently about the same issue."
Midgett, who became close with Hawkins during the filming of the documentary, understands different interpretations of faith. Her own religious tradition springs from the white evangelical church, her family is still very much a part of that world and she is a Wheaton alumna. "I have some strained relationships from having done the film," she says, "because there was definitely pressure to not do it."
Once she saw how polarizing Hawkins' stance had become within the evangelical community, she says, she felt she had to tell the story. "I think something so important is going on here, even more important than what happened to Larycia." Midgett believes that the evangelical movement "is at a critical point" in its relationship to political power. "It is a difficult time," she says, "because the majority of white evangelicals right now, the platform that they have is antithetical to a lot of Christianity, in my opinion. I say this as somebody with relatives and close friends who have those beliefs. These are people I love who I strongly disagree with. It's hard."
The filmmaker finds herself defending Hawkins' "same God" statement, over and over. "I continue to see people who have decided in their minds that she is conflating Christ and Islam," Midgett says. "And they're completely wrong, that's not what she was saying and not what that statement means. It's important to understand what it means, and the intent."
As the film grapples with the dissonance between the principles of Christianity and the response to Hawkins' gesture, Hawkins is also shown coming to terms with the part race and sex played in the outcome. She was supported by many colleagues on the faculty, and several of them - all men - speak freely in the film about racism and their issues with the way Hawkins was treated. "They are in a different position as men at the college," says Midgett. "And that's a reality. It was very difficult for me to get women to go on camera."
Though the film throws political and religious divisions into sharp relief, Hawkins says that her aim for its impact remains much the same as her aim for that original Facebook post. "I hope it brings people closer together," she says. "My favorite showings have been where I can see the body language of people relax over time, because they allowed themselves to stay in the conversation. I'd like to think those people left with a greater understanding about embodied solidarity."

Texto completo: Rajon Lynch's ties to Appleton — the one-time home of Harry Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
One thing Rajon Lynch is unable to escape? His ties to Harry Houdini.
Not that he'd want to.
The 23-year-old magician who in recent years performed around the Appleton area, including at the History Museum at the Castle and Houdini's Escape Gastropub, has found a new job in a new city. He's now the director of the Houdini Museum of New York.
His ties to Appleton — the one-time home of Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
"I think it definitely piqued his interest," Lynch said of the museum's owner, Roger Dreyer, who hired him in September. "Being from Appleton, when I started getting in the papers and stuff, the main thing was Houdini was old and Appleton might be looking to revive magic. Because I started writing about that stuff, I felt like I had a good grasp in terms of what people want from magic."
Houdini famously claimed to be a native of Appleton, though he came here as a child from Budapest, Hungary, and left well before finding fame. Lynch, who performs as RJ the Magician, is a native of Racine who came to this area for college — he earned a communications degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the spring — and often performed in Appleton while in school.
In 2017, he launched a dinner-show program called "Now Serving Magic," which was hosted at times by Houdini's Escape, the History Museum and Oshkosh's Time Community Theater.
He spent the summer after graduation teaching magic in China. That's where he was when he was first contacted about the opening at the Houdini Museum, which is found in the same city Houdini now rests. The great illusionist is buried in a cemetery in Queens.
Opened in 2012, the museum itself is a small, a one-room showcase on the fourth floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, but it houses more than $3million in memorabilia. With cuffs, posters, keys, a coffin and a trunk from the famous "Metamorphasis" stunt, it's the largest public collection of Houdini items.
One of the goals of the Houdini Museum, according to the official website, is to "inspire all age groups to realize once you focus and set your mind on something, you can accomplish anything you desire." It's fitting, then, that shortly before Now Serving Magic was starting in Wisconsin, Lynch told The Post-Crescent his plans after college were simple: "I want to be in New York," he said.
The operation also includes the Fantasma Magic Shop, which Lynch now oversees. He said they often sell magic kits to kids, and he joked he sometimes feels like "black Santa."
"You don't see magic shops around anymore," said Lynch, who owned a Fantasma kit as a child. "When my parents were younger, like every neighborhood (in New York) had a magic shop where you could go and learn some tricks. Now it's all converted to online."
Besides peddling magic wares, the duties he took on in September include giving tours, producing magic shows, performing and chatting up the guests.
He also helps market the museum, something he's already getting the hang of. In his few short months he's been covered by New York's ABC, NBC and Fox affiliates, AM New York and The New York Times. (And now, of course, The Post-Crescent.)
As a young, black magician with a background linked with Houdini, he knows he has a story hook.
"I was able to learn that I kind of had a knack for writing, especially about magic," he said. "And that's probably why I got this job, because I love magic, I love people and I love making connections like that."
RJ the Magician returns Rajon Lynch, a.k.a. RJ the Magician, will be back in northeast Wisconsin for a performance with two other magicians. The event is at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at Tim Community Theater, 445 N. Main St. in Oshkosh. RJ will perform with Caleb Hyatt and Noah Sonie. Hyatt is based in Milwaukee and Sonie is from Minnesota. Tickets start at $15 and are available at eventbrite.com.

Trump's contributions to America?

Texto completo: My fellow Republicans:
Your USPS letters to me parrot the list of Trump's contributions that I also receive. Consider several of them:
Tax cuts for the wealthy increased our federal debt cataclysmically, enslaving our descendants. With their tax reductions, corporations repurchased stocks, profiting the rich 1% to 2% and leaving the other 98% holding the bag.
Trump's trade policies. My grain in Iowa sold for 1/10 the value of my dad's in 1945.
Immigration. Trump had control of both chambers of Congress for two years and failed legislatively to solve the problems. He only cared to use immigration as an emotional political power mechanism to control his voter base.
Trump has sold his soul to sustain his presidential power, even to Russia's Putin, who got him elected in 2016. Putin's technocrats are now geared up for the 2020 campaign. With Murdoch's Fox News and Zuckerberg's Facebook, it will not be surprising that Trump will be re-elected, in spite of his treasonous criminal behavior documented in "The Mueller Report" and recent hearings in Congress.
Don't be complicit in causing the demise of our Republican Party and our democracy by failure to be informed and taking action. For example, Google the fascinating testimony to Congress by Fiona Hill, a former National Security Council adviser to Trump.

Resolve to make diet plant-based? The holidays seem to whiplash us from one extreme to the other: Eat, drink and be merry vs. the customary New Year's resolutions – reduce social media use, reduce weight, and embrace a plant-based diet.
One-third of consumers already report reducing their consumption of animal foods. Hundreds of school, college, hospital and corporate cafeterias have embraced Meatless Monday. Even fast-food chains Chipotle, Denny's, Panera, Subway, Taco Bell and White Castle are rolling out plant-based options.
A dozen startups, led by Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are creating healthyand delicious plant-based meat and dairy alternatives. Meat industry giants Tyson Foods, Cargill and Canada's Maple Leaf Foods have invested heavily in plant-based meat development.
According to Plant-Based Foods Association, plant-based food sales have grown by 20% in recent years, 10 times the growth rate of all foods. Sales of plant-based cheeses, creamers, butter, yogurts, and ice creams are exploding at a 50% growth rate. Plant-based milks now account for 15% of the milk market.
The plant-based New Year's resolution requires no sweat or deprivation – just some fun exploration.

'Stop hating' Trump, enjoy economy? President Trump has been persecuted since the day he announced his candidacy.
It's funny to read letters from people who parrot CNN, etc. and declare him guilty because of his phone call to the new president of Ukraine. They actually believe the Democrat spin and don't bother to get facts by reading the transcript.
They ignore that he has created the best economy in years, an economy that is rewarding lower-income people more than any other wage earners.
Look it up for yourself. Stop believing the pundits. Educate yourself and find out the truth.
Kathi Angelone, Cape Coral
A Christmas tale of impeachment In 2019, The New York Times suggested to Nancy Pelosi that even though no one had solid evidence of an impeachable offense by President Trump, that was no proof that none had ever been committed.
So Nancy commissioned a pair of elves (Schiff and Nadler) to find the heretofore unseen offense. Lo and behold, she was soon assured by Schiff that he had uncovered proof of an offense that was so crass and so blatant that it would surely command bipartisan support leading to the impeachment and removal of Trump.
With promise in hand, Nancy authorized Schiff and Nadler to go forward with all haste, hoping to have overwhelming evidence to take to the Senate by Christmas.
Unfortunately, the articles of Impeachment brought forward were thin gruel at best. Rather than a great Christmas prize, Nancy found two lumps of coal in her stocking. Even worse was an unexpected third lump – Joe and Hunter Biden.
Now Nancy is procrastinating and demanding, in vain, that the Senate finish the job that the elves could not.
Sorry, Nancy, but Santa didn't deliver the goods, and it's unlikely that the Senate will either.

Self-checkout on Sundays sparks battle in France

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - On a Sunday afternoon, customers at a Géant Casino supermarket browsed the aisles and lined up to buy groceries. It was a typical shopping experience except for one thing: All the cashiers had gone home. Customers scanned items at automated checkout stations as security guards hovered nearby.
That the store was even open was unusual. French labor rules prohibit most shops from employing workers past 1 p.m. on Sundays. But as e-commerce and online giants like Amazon usher in an era of round-the-clock spending, retailers are amping up the use of automated cashiers to help them compete.
The move has caused an outcry in France, where Sundays are traditionally a rest day for workers and families. While self-checkout machines are often used alongside cashiers, labor unions say tilting toward fully cashierless operations threatens the French way of life by encouraging American-style consumerism and automation, putting thousands of jobs at risk.
"Sundays are sacred," said Patrice Auvinet, the head of the General Confederation of Labor union in Angers, a midsize city in western France. "If they change that, it will change French society."
Groupe Casino, the country's biggest supermarket operator, began testing Sunday-afternoon openings in August using only automated machines at the warehouse-sized supermarket in Angers. It has expanded the experiment to at least 20 other megastores around the country, igniting raucous protests.
Casino further riled unions recently by becoming the first supermarket chain in France to keep most of its stores open - including the one in Angers - on Christmas Day using only self-checkout machines. Casino said in a statement that it planned to do the same on New Year's Day, and that the move was an extension of how it was already operating on Sunday afternoons.
"We're in a very competitive environment," said Sébastien Corrado, the marketing director of Groupe Casino. "The internet doesn't have frontiers, so we need to adapt to new modes of consumption that let us stay in the game and be winners."
Ringing up more profit is especially important for Groupe Casino, which also operates supermarkets in South America and Asia. It is restructuring billions of euros of debt after its holding companies recently entered a form of bankruptcy protection.
At the Angers store, which employs 115 in a working-class neighborhood, Groupe Casino is having salaried employees clock out as usual at 12:30 p.m. on Sundays, then bringing in security guards, hired through another company, to keep the store open through evening.
Groupe Casino's huge supermarkets, like the one in Angers, employ thousands, often on urban outskirts with limited job opportunities. That first Sunday afternoon in August, 200 demonstrators converged on the Angers store, chanting angrily and accusing the company of taking a big step toward replacing employees.

Texto completo: Sam Kumar ("Surveillance of American citizens needs oversight," Dec. 29) is using a legitimate concern about civil liberties as a Trojan horse for Trump propaganda about deep-state conspiracies.
It is correct that the Justice Department's inspector general sharply criticized the FBI for how it documented its application for a surveillance warrant on Carter Page, a onetime adviser to the Trump campaign.
But Kumar goes on to imply that the FBI "spied" on the Trump campaign in cahoots with the Democratic Party. The evidence? That the FBI relied in part on a document — the so-called Steele dossier — that had been funded by Democrats.
Here's what Kumar omits:
The report flatly dismisses the Trump/GOP/Kumar narrative about a deep-state political conspiracy. Instead, it says it found "no documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation" for the investigations into Page or other top Trump campaign operatives.
The report explicitly concludes the FBI had "sufficient" information to justify the warrant on Page as well as to launch the broader probe of the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia.
Contrary to Kumar, the Russia probe did not originate with the so-called Steele dossier. As the Justice Department itself has confirmed, the investigation began when the FBI learned that a Trump campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, had bragged that the Russians had a huge pile of Democratic emails — before those emails were released. That was a good reason to be worried.
There is ample evidence that Trump and his top people — Don Jr., Paul Manafort, Jared Kushner — were drooling to get political help from Russia.
As president, Donald Trump has done almost everything he could to support the Russian agenda. Here's just a short list: resisting sanctions against Russia; defending Vladimir Putin against the U.S. intelligence community's findings about Russian election interference; undermining NATO, the European Union and key U.S. allies, such as Germany. And let's not forget Trump's loathsome treatment of Ukraine, which is under siege from Russia.
If Kumar is really worried about political bias in the Justice Department, he should take a closer look at Attorney General William Barr, who has gone to great lengths to investigate the investigators and to shield President Trump. It's Barr, after all, who dismissed the now-famous whistleblower complaint about Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine into digging up dirt on Vice President Biden.
In fairness, I am thrilled that the IG report has prompted Congress to at least talk about new limits on surveillance.
But let's not kid ourselves. If Trump thought he could use the FBI to eavesdrop on the Democratic Party, and not get caught, do we really think he or his GOP apologists would have moral qualms?
By feeding into deep-state conspiracy theories about the FBI and Democrats, Kumar is merely parroting another party line from Trump-Land in the hope that people won't notice the real threats to our national security and civil rights.

Texto completo: The world knew before Brittany Feliciano.
Feliciano was upstairs in her Myrtle Beach home. Like so many others watching for Hurricane Dorian's arrival Sept. 5, all she had to do that day was wait and worry.
So, she molded Play-Doh for her newborn.
She watched him. The Weather Channel. Her Facebook feed.
Then a friend from Charleston messaged Feliciano with a question, and the answer to it would change the course of Feliciano's day, week and coming months.
There's a red Jeep Cherokee on the beach, the message read. Could it be hers?
By that point, the sensational image of a Jeep stranded in the waves already belonged to social media stand-ups.
In the coming hours, it would launch a series of #DorianJeep memes, with the abandoned SUV photoshopped into sea scenes from "Castaway," "Titanic" and "The Little Mermaid." It made headlines in The New York Times and CNN. The Twitter feeds of the likes of Good Morning America's Ginger Zee.
That all added up to an official, searchable nickname – Myrtle Beach Jeep.
The not-yet-famous also got in on the gag. Someone shot video of a man appearing to meditate on the roof of the 2014 vehicle with waves crashing around him. Another clip featured a different man playing "Amazing Grace" and "Taps" on the bagpipes during low tide.
Thousands tuned into #JeepWatch2019, a live feed set up by a local TV station.
It became a sort of mascot for Hurricane Dorian's U.S. landfall. Myrtle Beach Jeep was a distraction from the destruction and comic relief from the harrowing forecasts that gripped coastal communities for days in September.
Dorian was the second-most-powerful storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. In its slow march toward the U.S., it ravaged the Bahamas for days, killing at least 61 people and flattening miles of neighborhoods.
Now, at the close of a decade defined by social media sensations, Myrtle Beach Jeep joined the ranks of other viral stars of the recent past: a pregnant giraffe named April, a watermelon squeezed by rubber bands, that Wyoming intersection traffic camera.
Back on Sept. 5, the world wide web watched and waited as the waves rose and fell. Hurricane Dorian came and left, leaving just snapped leaves and toppled trashcans on Ocean Boulevard. By the next morning, the skies were clear, and the Myrtle Beach Police Department towed the Myrtle Beach Jeep away.
The Internet moved on. Feliciano did not.
It was her Jeep, and she wanted this moment to mean something more.
Why the Jeep was on Myrtle Beach About five minutes after Feliciano read her friend's message, she heard a knock on the door.
It was a police officer. An officer on the doorstep was all she and her husband needed to see to know the Jeep going viral used to be parked at their house.
Feliciano's husband's cousin was driving the Jeep.
Feliciano has four kids, so she opted for the family minivan. The cousin needed a car, and they had one they weren't using. And the Felicianos are the kind of people who offer solutions to others people's problems.
The cousin is exactly the type of person who would end up driving toward the beach in a hurricane, Feliciano said. "He is literally the most adventurous."
He's that cousin.
He was trying to grab some video of the ocean before the storm hit and the sun rose, Feliciano said. When he turned around to head back, he hit a drainage wall. The car couldn't move. But he could. So, he left to find help.
But he was in an evacuation zone. Businesses were closed. Services were limited.
When he returned, the bloated ocean was shaking and shifting the car – weighing at least 3,000 pounds – as if it was agitated with the thing.
It was too late. The cousin left without the car, and he didn't call the Felicianos to tell them what had just happened.
No charges were filed against the driver, according to the Myrtle Beach Police Department. It is illegal to drive on the beach.
What's next for Myrtle Beach Jeep Feliciano is from Bladen County, near Wilmington, North Carolina. After Hurricane Florence flooded the region in 2018, she drove her minivan, packed with donations, back home. She's seen people she cares so much about lose so much to a natural disaster.
The day the Jeep left the beach, she and her husband, Nick, launched a GoFundMe aiming to pivot the spotlight toward the humanitarian crisis in the Bahamas. It raised a couple thousand for UNICEF USA to help with the disaster relief. The goal was $100,000.
"Anything is better than nothing," Feliciano said.
They earned another $50 from a celebrity appearance at the AutoFair at Charlotte Motorspeedway in October.
The couple, however, didn't give up on their belief that their loss could help others who lost so much more.
Their insurance company totaled the Jeep, but the couple got a year grace period to use the car for charity drives before it heads to its final destination, the salvage yard.
For the holiday season, the couple launched a Fill the Jeep event. They are seeking non-perishable food items to donate to South Strand Helping Hand, a social services organization in Surfside Beach.
The Jeep is now back at the Feliciano house. They keep it cloaked in a cover.
In early December, the car looked a bit different than it did in those viral beach images. The Jeep was part of a float in a Christmas Parade in North Myrtle Beach, cast as a 2019 version of the Grinch's sled. It was like the Jeep was photoshopped into a scene from the animated classic.
A string of Christmas and silver tinsel garland lined the sides. The roof carried a red sack stuffed with the Grinch's loot.
Stacked presents concealed the damage on the front.
Musician Stan James Gregory wanted to see the internet-famous Jeep in Myrtle Beach on Sept. 6. His wife, Paula, got a photo for his website.

Marriage is dead? Not in America.

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes.
The critically-acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its co-star Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York and Hollywood. The bestselling new novel from Taffy Brodesser-Akner, "Fleishman Is in Trouble," tells a similarly bleak story about another bitter divorce unfolding in New York between a doctor and a talent agent.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
But the story of the death of marriage has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and Times op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce, the reality is there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s, offering their children a better shot at a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, non-marital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
Since 2009, the rate of non-marital childbearing has fallen from 41% to 39.6% in 2018. We think what's happened, in part, is young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upward. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock means more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upward in the coming years.
What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.
And, as we have seen, those who are privileged to be born into married-parent families today are less likely than children in the past few decades to witness their parents' divorce, sparing children the grief that often follows the death of their parents' marriage.
This is all good news for our children, good news that has been obscured in recent pop cultural and media depictions of marriage in America. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.

A look at the decade's most important people in dining

Texto completo: It's not easy to come up with a list of New Jersey's most influential food people of the decade. It's especially not easy when you consider how much innovation and how many changes took place over the past 10 years.
As the New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells recently noted, this decade has seen the rise of Instagram and consequently how chefs cook (make it Insta-worthy, chef!); the proliferation of small-plates (tapas, anyone?) and the increase of vegetarian and vegan diners (how do you like your Impossible burger, ma'am?). Let's not overlook the explosion of the farm-to-table, tail-to-snout movement; the mushrooming of the fast-casual restaurant, and the rapid growth of craft breweries and artisanal food.
But we, food reporters and editors of USA Today Network in New Jersey — read our bios at the end of this story — love a good challenge. To help us with this formidable task, also enlisted we turned to two trusted food lovers and avid restaurant-goers: Michael Sinatra, a Hoboken and Asbury Park resident who is vice president of communications for restaurants-discovery platforms The Infatuation and Zagat, and formerly with Whole Foods Market; and Vincent Barcelona, a River Vale resident and former restaurant chef-owner who today runs Vincent Barcelona Hospitality, a restaurant consulting business.
So, who are the women and men who made the greatest mark this decade on the ever-evolving, ever-expanding, ever-luscious dining landscape in New Jersey? Let's dig right in.
The Wizard | David Burke Ventanas, Fort Lee; David Burke at Orange Lawn, South Orange; Drifthouse by David Burke, Sea Bright; and Nauti Bar in Sea Bright
The Mentor | Anthony Bucco Chef/Owner, Felina, Ridgewood
The Restaurateur | Chris Cannon Owner, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown
The Chef | Robbie Felice Chef/Owner, Viaggio, Wayne, and Osteria Crescendo, Westwood
The Grill Master |Stephen Chrisomalis, Jr. Chef/Owner, Steve's Burgers, two locations, both in Garfield
CENTRAL The Mixologist | Jamie Dodge Reyna's, Barrio Costero and Laylow, Asbury Park
The Sommelier | Susanne Wagner Wine Director, Restaurant Latour, Hamburg
The Partners in All Things Food | Neilly Robinson and David Viana Owner and Chef/Partner Respectively, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge
The Brewer | Michael Kane Founder, Kane Brewing Company, Ocean Township
The Sommelier | Francis P. Schott Co-owner and Beverage Director, Stage Left Steakhouse and Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick
The Professor | Craig Shelton Co-Founder, Princeton Center for Food Studies, Princeton University
The Teacher | Chris Mumford Former Chef/Owner, Mumford's Cafe, Tinton Falls
The Chef | Bruce Lefebvre Chef/Owner, The Frog & the Peach, New Brunswick
The Beer Expert | Mike Proske Owner, Project PUB and Tapastre, both in Somerville
The Restaurateur | Steven Botta Owner, Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park; Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro; Feast Italian Kitchen in Old Bridge; and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse in Old Bridge
SOUTH The Rising Star, Valentina Fortuna Co-Owner/Chef, Constellation Collective, Collingswood
She may have grown up in nearby Haddon Heights, but Valentina Fortuna made her mark in Collingswood's competitive dining scene. With founding partners Maura Rosato and Lindsey Ferguson, she quickly saw Constellation's star rise.
Born first as a catering company and farmers market pop-up, and nurtured in an industrial Collingswood building, the from-scratch bakery and cafe is a magnet for food aficionados from both sides of the Delaware. Nashville Hot Chicken, housemade tacos and especially Constellation's famous Honey Pie bring them back for more. In fewer than five years, the 32-year-old captured the Garden State Culinary Arts's 2018 Ring Star Chef Award.
The Sushi Veteran | Shigeru Fukuyoshi Sagami, Cherry Hill
Sushi is everywhere from the hibachi chains to the supermarket, but Fukuyoshi remains the master.
The 74-year-old chef hasn't stopped producing some of the best raw-fish dishes at his no-frills restaurant. He honed his skills in a New York City restaurant five decades ago and brought sushi to South Jersey in 1974. Any wonder that Fukuyoshi's knives have Philadelphia chefs and celebrities frequently cross the Delaware to get their chopsticks around his sushi?
Fukuyoshi has watched as sushi spots have proliferated across the landscape, but he remains the standard-bearer: In 2017, Sagami was nominated for Outstanding Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation Awards.
The Neighborhood Star | Joey Baldino Chef/Owner, Zeppoli, Collingswood
Whether he ever lands that James Beard Best Chef Award, this eight-time nominee is confident in his Sicilian-inspired cooking and his 35-seat humble BYOB restaurant in Collingswood. From the carefully curated Sicilian-style antipasto platter to the cloud-like ricotta gnocchi to the savory rabbit stew, no meal at Zeppoli is easily forgotten.
Baldino is the chef most frequently cited as the best of the best in the southern half of the state, and can claim credit for making the borough a formidable food destination. (His annual Sicilian-style backyard barbecues sell out in mere minutes.) This unassuming chef also owns the members-only Palizzi Social Club in South Philly, and recently put out his first cookbook, drawing from his family's history and the menu there. But he can frequently be found manning his open kitchen and chatting with guests on the Jersey side.
The Culinary Phoenix | Jim Malaby Chef/Owner, blueplate, Mullica Hill
When Jim Malaby's then 14-year-year-old restaurant caught fire in August 2018 after costly renovations, the chef and owner didn't despair. He brought it back one year later, bigger and better.
A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Malaby once worked at Philadelphia's well-known four-star restaurant Brasserie Perrier, owned by George Perrier.
The Mullica Hill resident set the pace for other South Jersey chefs who wished to apply the "farm-to-fork" label. He works closely with farmers, incorporating their harvest into his seasonal fare. Malaby also was an early adapter to offering menu items for those with dietary restrictions.
The relaunch of blueplate and its comfort food, with both New American and French influences, was met with gratitude in a region of South Jersey without a lot of dining options.
The Locavore | Todd Fuller Chef, Farm & Fisherman Tavern, Cherry Hill
The last 15 years have seen the rise of the eat-local, farm-to-fork movement throughout the culinary world, but few chefs take it to heart like Todd Fuller, chef/partner at this Cherry Hill mainstay.
This relaxed yet sophisticated restaurant and tavern was launched by Cherry Hill residents Colleen and Josh Lawler in 2013, the second iteration of their Philly BYOB (a 2012 James Beard nominee for Best New Restaurant). In partnership with Fuller and mixologist Danny Childs, they champion sustainable, regional produce and proteins and offer one of the most ambitious farm-to-bar cocktail menus in the region.
Fuller is a master of nose-to-tail cooking, aims for a zero-waste kitchen and is a frequent partner of the Courier-Post in its #WasteNot efforts to combat food waste in New Jersey.
The Natural | Phil Manganaro Chef/Owner, Park Place Cafe & Restaurant, Merchantville
From foraging for wild blueberries, morels and maple syrup to making his own sea salt, baking his own rustic breads, and preparing from-scratch-made pastas and classic French dishes, Phil Manganaro runs a tiny restaurant that is very much a one-man show, one that critics love. Guests to Park Place can reserve a seat in the kitchen and watch Manganaro work his magic or relax in the small dining room, where they will be treated to vinyl records, dozens of photos of Pinelands flora and fauna, and a perfect cup of espresso.
In a glowing three-star review two years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer's restaurant critic wrote, "Park Place Cafe is the best excuse to pay a $5 toll I've found in years."
The Multi-Restaurant Operator | The PJW Restaurant Group The PJW Restaurant Group, headquartered in Haddon Township, revolutionized casual dining in South Jersey, first with the PJ Whelihan mini-chain (find one in Cherry Hill, Haddon Township, Maple Shade, Medford Lakes and Washington Township), but also The Pour House, Treno Pizza Bar and Central Taco & Tequila (all in Westmont). Today it has nine restaurants in Southern Jersey and more across the bridges.
PJW Assistant Culinary Director Jacqueline Platzer was recognized by the Garden State Culinary Arts Awards for her part in creating PJW's core and seasonal menus.
The Newcomers | Dominic and Lindsay Piperno Owners, Hearthside BYOB, Collingswood
When the Pipernos opened Hearthside in Collingswood in 2017, they did what you might think was impossible. Their New Jersey restaurant quickly began racking up "Best New Restaurant in Philadelphia" accolades, including from Food & Wine.
Among their other early honors was a Best New Restaurant nomination from Bon Appetit and a Garden State Culinary Arts Award for Best New Restaurant in the state.
With its hearth as a focal point, an evolving seasonal menu and impeccable service, Hearthside gets raves from all quarters, and is easily the hardest-to-land reservation in South Jersey. Chef Dominic Piperno leads the kitchen, while Lindsay's vision inspires front of house.
The couple has announced plans to open a wine bar nearby, and South Jersey eagerly awaits whatever comes next from this team.

Texto completo: It's not easy to come up with a list of New Jersey's most influential food people of the decade. It's especially not easy when you consider how much innovation and how many changes took place over the past 10 years.
As the New York Times restaurant critic Pete Wells recently noted, this decade has seen the rise of Instagram and consequently how chefs cook (make it Insta-worthy, chef!); the proliferation of small-plates (tapas, anyone?) and the increase of vegetarian and vegan diners (how do you like your Impossible burger, ma'am?). Let's not overlook the explosion of the farm-to-table, tail-to-snout movement; the mushrooming of the fast-casual restaurant, and the rapid growth of craft breweries and artisanal food.
But we, food reporters and editors of USA Today Network in New Jersey — read our bios at the end of this story — love a good challenge. To help us with this formidable task, also enlisted we turned to two trusted food lovers and avid restaurant-goers: Michael Sinatra, a Hoboken and Asbury Park resident who is vice president of communications for restaurants-discovery platforms The Infatuation and Zagat, and formerly with Whole Foods Market; and Vincent Barcelona, a River Vale resident and former restaurant chef-owner who today runs Vincent Barcelona Hospitality, a restaurant consulting business.
So, who are the women and men who made the greatest mark this decade on the ever-evolving, ever-expanding, ever-luscious dining landscape in New Jersey? Let's dig right in.
The Wizard | David Burke Ventanas, Fort Lee; David Burke at Orange Lawn, South Orange; Drifthouse by David Burke, Sea Bright; and Nauti Bar in Sea Bright
He may be one of America's most creative and innovative chefs — he has restaurants in New York, Washington, Sarasota Springs and Garden City, Long Island. But David Burke, a Fort Lee resident who began his admirable career in New Jersey (washing dishes at the Sheraton Hotel in his hometown of Hazlet), heads five restaurants in New Jersey with plans to add more Jersey spots to his portfolio in the years to come.
He made food Insta-friendly before Instagram even existed (seen his bacon hanging on a miniature clothesline?); he has won a handful of James Beard awards (including Best Chef New York — twice) and received the coveted Meilleurs Ouvriers de France Diplôme d'Honneur (the only American chef to do so). And now he is slowly growing an empire in his home state. "At my age, I don't need to fly all over the world," Burke told The Record earlier this year. "I can save three hours by staying in New Jersey." Besides, he said, "I'm a Jersey guy." A Jersey culinary wizard, we'd say.
The Mentor | Anthony Bucco Chef/Owner, Felina, Ridgewood
Matawan resident Anthony Bucco has wowed critics and diners alike with his cooking prowess in a slew of top-notch restaurants. He garnered a four-star review in 2012 in New Jersey Monthly for his cooking at the legendary Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station. Bucco also received ai guessn "Excellent," New York Times's highest rating, and AAA's coveted Four Diamond Award. Plus he got four stars from The Star-Ledger for his work at Stage Left Steakhouse in New Brunswick, Uproot in Warren and the Ryland Inn. And this year his modern Italian restaurant Felina was named by New Jersey Monthly one of the Best Restaurants in New Jersey.
Impressive? Yes. But perhaps even more impressive is how many chefs under his tutelage today are heading first-rate kitchens themselves. The list includes: J.R. Belt, executive chef at Stage Left Steakhouse and restaurant Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick; Jason Ramos, executive chef of the Pluckemin Inn in Bedminster; Martyna Krowicka, chef de cuisine, Felina; AJ Capella, executive chef, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown; David Viana, executive chef-partner, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge (see below); Aishling Stevens and Matt Laurich, executive chef and chef de cusine respectively, Crystal Springs Resort and Restaurant Latour, Hamburg; and Randy Forrester, who until recently was chef and owner of award-winning Osteria Radici in Allentown.
Says Bucco about his many prominent proteges: "These talented individuals did more to ensure their own success than I or anyone could have ever done for them. I am humbled to have had so many talented people share time in the kitchens I have had the luxury of overseeing. They own the success, not I." Talented and humble: a winning combination in life and the kitchen.
The Restaurateur | Chris Cannon Owner, Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, Morristown
Once arguably the predominant restaurateur in New York City (his portfolio included Marea, Alto and Convivio), nearly six years ago Chris Cannon showed New York hotshots and New Jersey diffident food lovers what can be done on this side of the Hudson. Jockey Hollow Bar & Kitchen, his magnificent,15,000-square-foot, four-restaurant compound in Morristown, was the first Garden State restaurant in 2015 to make Esquire's Best New Restaurant list in more than a decade. It also received a 3-and-a-half star review in New Jersey Monthly and was named by NJ.com as one of the "49 restaurants you need to eat at before you die."
Cannon, a proud Mountain Lakes resident and passionate wine lover, wants those across the river to know that dining (and boozing) on this side is pretty darn amazing. "New Jersey is so misunderstood, so maligned," Cannon told Esquire. "Three quarters of the stuff from the Union Square green market is coming from New Jersey. My staff, all the key guys, moved from the city out here." Feeling slightly cowed, NYC?
The Chef | Robbie Felice Chef/Owner, Viaggio, Wayne, and Osteria Crescendo, Westwood
Not yet 30 — he celebrated his 29th birthday two months ago — Robbie Felice, a Sussex native and a Culinary Institute of America graduate, has already shown North Jersey diners how awesome authentic Italian food tastes at his two award-winning restaurants: Viaggio in Wayne and Osteria Crescendo in Westwood.
Nowhere on his menu are such Italian-American dishes as chicken cacciatore, penne alla vodka, spaghetti and meatballs or garlic bread. Arancini, di Stefano Stracciatella, salmon oreganato, tagliatelle Bolognese, and tiramisu panna cotta are.
Felice cures his meats, hand rolls his pasta, makes most everything from scratch. In less than four years, he's shown New Jersey how darn good real Italian food can taste. Buon appetito!
The Pizzaiolo | Dan Richer Owner, Razza Pizza Artiginale, Jersey City
Seven years ago, Dan Richer, a Rutgers University grad, opened a BYOB pizza joint in Jersey City — and redefined the art of pizza making.
Says Michael Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Outside of sports gambling, Razza has maybe become the state's most successful new source of interstate commerce. Anyone who's been rants about the incredible bread, butter and pizza. But more importantly, Razza gives New Jersey the hammer that punches the final nail in the coffin of the debate of who does it better: NJ or NYC. Don't believe it? Just check out the people filing off the PATH train at Grove Street to get a taste of some of what's on a menu that pays tribute to purveyors in every corner of the state."
The Grill Master |Stephen Chrisomalis, Jr. Chef/Owner, Steve's Burgers, two locations, both in Garfield
Stephen Chrisomalis, Jr. may have learned how to butcher animals, clean and debone fish and julienne vegetables at the Johnson & Wales culinary school, but the Hackensack resident is happy, thank you very much, flipping burgers at his roadside stand, and equally humble second, similarly eponymous burger joint, in Garfield.
Not just any burgers, mind you. But, well, the best. Yelpers recently named Steve's Burgers one of 50 Best Burgers in America. Travel Channel's "Food Paradise" voted it the best in the tri-state area. And in 2018, it was named "Best Burger" at the Famous Food Festival in Jersey City. We second all those accolades, having named his patty Bergen's Best Burger this year.
CENTRAL The Mixologist | Jamie Dodge Reyna's, Barrio Costero and Laylow, Asbury Park
For too long, cocktail culture huddled in a few corners of the Garden State (Cheers, Jersey City! Cheers, Princeton!). But over the past 10 years, it has spilled over widely into just about every Jersey region.
Mixologist Jaime Dodge can take a chunk of credit for New Jersey's newfound cocktail zeal. The 35-year-old Long Valley native started his career seven years ago at Circa in High Bridge and went on to floor the press and cocktail lovers alike with his wildly creative potent potions at Elements, Princeton's revered fine-dine restaurant, and Mistral, its more casual sister restaurant.
Today he heads the drinks programs at three Asbury Park spots: Mexican restaurants Reyna's and Barrio Costero and newly opened cocktail lounge Laylow.
The press — and public — have taken notice. In a review of Barrio, New Jersey Monthly wrote: "(Executive chef) Anthony Bustamante is not Barrio's only star. Jamie Dodge ... has crafted Mexican-influenced cocktails that make Barrio's busy bar worth a visit on its own."
Recently, Dodge began concocting "off-the-wall" drinks in underground "killer lounge" Laylow that serves as his lab for experimentation. "I'm playing with more science," he says; his toys include foams, infusions, citrus acids — as well as homemade tonics, gins, colas and syrups. We can't wait to drink what he comes up with next.
The Sommelier | Susanne Wagner Wine Director, Restaurant Latour, Hamburg
German-born Susanne Wagner, wine director at Restaurant Latour, is arguably the most knowledgeable sommelier in the Garden State. She oversees one of the world's most exceptional wine collections, boasting more than 100,000 bottles.
Last year, The Wine Enthusiast Restaurant named Restaurant Latour to its Restaurant Hall of Fame, the only New Jersey restaurant to be given the honor. It is in stellar company; also inducted were such industry luminaries as Blue Hill at Stone Barns (Pocantico Hills, N.Y.) Eleven Madison Park (New York City) and The French Laundry (Yountville, Calif.).
And while New Jersey oenophiles rave about her — "She's amazing; hands down the best," declares Anthony Bucco, chef and owner of Felina in Ridgewood — her influence stretches beyond the borders of New Jersey. Among those she has trained are Samantha Shaw, today wine director of highly regarded seafood restaurant The Pearl in Nantucket, Mass.; Brent Jones, cellar sommelier at The French Laundry in Napa, Calif.; and Kenneth Belgard, who recently started working at The Modern in NYC.
The Partners in All Things Food | Neilly Robinson and David Viana Owner and Chef/Partner Respectively, Heirloom Kitchen, Old Bridge
Three years ago, chef David Viana became a partner of six-year-old Heirloom Kitchen, a restaurant, retail boutique and cooking school founded by Neilly Robinson and housed in one gorgeous space in Old Bridge. And while the wonderfully talented chef has gotten lots of kudos — he was nominated for a James Beard award; was inducted into the Hall of Fame at his culinary alma mater, the Institute of Culinary Education; became one of 15 chefs to compete on Top Chef's 16th season — Robinson is no industry slouch.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "While David Viana's food is what has brought a level of notoriety to Heirloom Kitchen as a restaurant, Neilly Robinson's tireless work in developing a dedicated following for her best-in-class cooking school and connecting the state's most influential food suppliers together. From butchers in North Bergen to bakers in Asbury Park, oyster harvesters on the Barnegat Bay, local chefs, wine retailers, farmers and more, Neilly is an undeniable lynchpin that connects all things related to food in not only Monmouth County but throughout the state."
The Brewer | Michael Kane Founder, Kane Brewing Company, Ocean Township
Kane Brewing churns out lots of different beer, make that, lots of amazing artisanal, small-batch beers. Kane specializes in hoppy and barrel-aged beers that wisely take advantage of the Garden State's bounty. Founder and owner Michael Kane mixes such local ingredients as New Jersey honey and apple cider into his brews.
"We work with local farms to make culinary-inspired beers," says the 43-year-old Little Silver resident. The brewery's flagship beer Head High today is poured in at least 500 restaurants and bars in New Jersey.
Says Sinatra of The Infatuation: "Kane Brewing might not have been the first, but its success in the 2010s brought newfound levels of respect to the state's growing brewery community, as well as long lines to their brewery for one-of-a-kind and special beer releases."
The Sommelier | Francis P. Schott Co-owner and Beverage Director, Stage Left Steakhouse and Catherine Lombardi, both in New Brunswick
In 1992, when Francis Schott and his business partner Mark Pascal opened Stage Left Steakhouse, hardly any restaurant in New Jersey was offering estate-bottled wines from small producers. Stage Left was. "Now everybody is doing it," said Schott, who is not only co-owner but beverage director of the restaurant. (He is beverage director for Catherine Lombardi, the duo's second restaurant, too.)
Thanks to Schott, Stage Left has won Wine Spectator's coveted Best of Award of Excellence every year since 2005. It has hosted some of the wine world's most luminary professionals, including Alexandra Cherniavsky, beverage director of The Love, an award-winning restaurant in Philadelphia, and Master Sommelier Johnathan Ross (ex-Eleven Madison Park guru; today a wine consultant in Australia). And it has introduced one of the first cocktail programs in the country. New York Times's drinks writer Robert Simonson features him in his book "A Proper Drink."
Says Schott, "We helped to change the way people drink wine and cocktails in New Jersey." A thank you is in order.
The Professor | Craig Shelton Co-Founder, Princeton Center for Food Studies, Princeton University
Craig Shelton, who has trained in eight of the world's greatest restaurants, including El Bulli, Jamin; Ma Maison and Le Bernardin, is one of only two New Jersey chefs to have ever received a James Beard Award (the other is Maricel Presilla, chef and owner of Cucharamama in Hoboken). The Bedminister resident also has received four New York Times four-star ratings, a five-star Forbes rating, the Relais & Châteaux Grand Chef title; and No 1. Top Restaurant in America in 2004 from GQ.
As many longtime Jersey food fans know, Shelton was the chef and owner of legendary haute-cuisine temple Ryland Inn until 2010. He was for a time the chef of a New Jersey diner (The Edison Diner), one that — surprise! — received a four-star review in The Star Ledger and the New York Times.
So what does an apparent awards magnet with more than 30 years of virtuoso cooking experience do at the pinnacle of his career? Teach — and think — about food, nutrition, agriculture, the environment ... and how they are related and can be made better.
In a statement, Shelton, who holds a degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from Yale, wrote that his mission is "to make great and healthy food available and affordable for all citizens of our great country." Shelton hopes to "help shift public opinion toward the demand for wholesome, nutritious and natural foods grown or raised holistically ... To bring fun and competency to the home cook and the professional culinarian ...To free culinary conventional wisdom from centuries of myth and false theory."
Recently, Shelton was awarded the New Jersey Restaurant Association's Lifetime Achievement Award. If only the Nobel Norwegian Committee gave a prize in food science.
The Teacher | Chris Mumford Former Chef/Owner, Mumford's Cafe, Tinton Falls
Chris Mumford was doing farm-to-table before it was the thing to do. He could see his garden from his restaurant window, where he also held cooking classes, teaching people they could make a beautiful meal from the food they grew in their backyards (the backyard of his own home was full of vegetables, too, as were the side yards and anywhere he could fit a pot). He has a passion for cooking unlike anyone most of us have seen, and chefs up and down the Shore hold him in the highest regard. He made cooking seem like something people could, and would want to, do.
(P.S.: After three decades of cooking, Mumford closed shop in mid-2018. But he left his cafe in good hands with chef Casey Pesce, who renamed it Apple Street Kitchen.)
The Chef | Bruce Lefebvre Chef/Owner, The Frog & the Peach, New Brunswick
Bruce Lefebvre has been cooking at what again and again many consider to be one of the state's best restaurants for some three decades. He was named executive chef in 2001, became the restaurant's owner in 2012. But don't expect to hear him boast.
"He is a very quiet, unassuming chef," says Vincent Barcelona, New Jersey-based restaurant consultant. Since Lefebvre won't toot his own horn, we thought we'd boast for him.
Lefebvre, Barcelona says, "has been impacting not only central New Jersey for the past decade with ever-evolving food, top-notch service, and a great wine program, but he has trained successful cooks that have gone on to have solid careers as chefs all over."
The Beer Expert | Mike Proske Owner, Project PUB and Tapastre, both in Somerville
For more than a decade, Mike Proske run Tapastre, a tapas-style restaurant that pairs dishes with its huge selection of craft beer. Project PUB is Proske's new venture, a brew pub that does a tap takeover every month at a brewery and offers a new menu designed to be paired with that brewery's beer. He also has hosted the town's Oktoberfest for the past few years, which has been called one of the best Oktoberfests in America, and has begun hosting a beer fest at Somerset Patriots Ballpark.
The Restaurateur | Steven Botta Owner, Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park; Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro; Feast Italian Kitchen in Old Bridge; and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse in Old Bridge
Monmouth County food enthusiasts have known for some time that Steven Botta, the executive chef and co-owner of the popular Brando's Citi Cucina in Asbury Park and Osteria Cucina Rustica in Marlboro, is a local authority on Italian cuisine. But earlier this year, Middlesex County residents learned it, too. Botta opened two restaurants in Old Bridge: Feast Italian Kitchen and Churrascaria Brazilian Steakhouse. He gets credit too for resurrecting Fromagerie in Rumson after it was sold by chef David Burke (see above, North).
SOUTH The Rising Star, Valentina Fortuna Co-Owner/Chef, Constellation Collective, Collingswood
She may have grown up in nearby Haddon Heights, but Valentina Fortuna made her mark in Collingswood's competitive dining scene. With founding partners Maura Rosato and Lindsey Ferguson, she quickly saw Constellation's star rise.
Born first as a catering company and farmers market pop-up, and nurtured in an industrial Collingswood building, the from-scratch bakery and cafe is a magnet for food aficionados from both sides of the Delaware. Nashville Hot Chicken, housemade tacos and especially Constellation's famous Honey Pie bring them back for more.
In fewer than five years, the 32-year-old captured the Garden State Culinary Arts's 2018 Ring Star Chef Award.
The Sushi Veteran | Shigeru Fukuyoshi Sagami, Cherry Hill
Sushi is everywhere from the hibachi chains to the supermarket, but Fukuyoshi remains the master.
The 74-year-old chef hasn't stopped producing some of the best raw-fish dishes at his no-frills restaurant. He honed his skills in a New York City restaurant five decades ago and brought sushi to South Jersey in 1974. Any wonder that Fukuyoshi's knives have Philadelphia chefs and celebrities frequently cross the Delaware to get their chopsticks around his sushi?
Fukuyoshi has watched as sushi spots have proliferated across the landscape, but he remains the standard-bearer: In 2017, Sagami was nominated for Outstanding Restaurant by the James Beard Foundation Awards.
The Neighborhood Star | Joey Baldino Chef/Owner, Zeppoli, Collingswood
Whether he ever lands that James Beard Best Chef Award, this eight-time nominee is confident in his Sicilian-inspired cooking and his 35-seat humble BYOB restaurant in Collingswood. From the carefully curated Sicilian-style antipasto platter to the cloud-like ricotta gnocchi to the savory rabbit stew, no meal at Zeppoli is easily forgotten.
Baldino is the chef most frequently cited as the best of the best in the southern half of the state, and can claim credit for making the borough a formidable food destination. (His annual Sicilian-style backyard barbecues sell out in mere minutes.)
This unassuming chef also owns the members-only Palizzi Social Club in South Philly, and recently put out his first cookbook, drawing from his family's history and the menu there. But he can frequently be found manning his open kitchen and chatting with guests on the Jersey side.
The Culinary Phoenix | Jim Malaby Chef/Owner, blueplate, Mullica Hill
When Jim Malaby's then 14-year-year-old restaurant caught fire in August 2018 after costly renovations, the chef and owner didn't despair. He brought it back one year later, bigger and better.
A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, Malaby once worked at Philadelphia's well-known four-star restaurant Brasserie Perrier, owned by George Perrier.
The Mullica Hill resident set the pace for other South Jersey chefs who wished to apply the "farm-to-fork" label. He works closely with farmers, incorporating their harvest into his seasonal fare. Malaby also was an early adapter to offering menu items for those with dietary restrictions.
The relaunch of blueplate and its comfort food, with both New American and French influences, was met with gratitude in a region of South Jersey without a lot of dining options.
The Locavore | Todd Fuller Chef, Farm & Fisherman Tavern, Cherry Hill
The last 15 years have seen the rise of the eat-local, farm-to-fork movement throughout the culinary world, but few chefs take it to heart like Todd Fuller, chef/partner at this Cherry Hill mainstay.
This relaxed yet sophisticated restaurant and tavern was launched by Cherry Hill residents Colleen and Josh Lawler in 2013, the second iteration of their Philly BYOB (a 2012 James Beard nominee for Best New Restaurant). In partnership with Fuller and mixologist Danny Childs, they champion sustainable, regional produce and proteins and offer one of the most ambitious farm-to-bar cocktail menus in the region.
Fuller is a master of nose-to-tail cooking, aims for a zero-waste kitchen and is a frequent partner of the Courier-Post in its #WasteNot efforts to combat food waste in New Jersey.
The Natural | Phil Manganaro Chef/Owner, Park Place Cafe & Restaurant, Merchantville
From foraging for wild blueberries, morels and maple syrup to making his own sea salt, baking his own rustic breads, and preparing from-scratch-made pastas and classic French dishes, Phil Manganaro runs a tiny restaurant that is very much a one-man show, one that critics love.
Guests to Park Place can reserve a seat in the kitchen and watch Manganaro work his magic or relax in the small dining room, where they will be treated to vinyl records, dozens of photos of Pinelands flora and fauna, and a perfect cup of espresso.
In a glowing three-star review two years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer's restaurant critic wrote, "Park Place Cafe is the best excuse to pay a $5 toll I've found in years."
The Multi-Restaurant Operator | The PJW Restaurant Group The PJW Restaurant Group, headquartered in Haddon Township, revolutionized casual dining in South Jersey, first with the PJ Whelihan mini-chain (find one in Cherry Hill, Haddon Township, Maple Shade, Medford Lakes and Washington Township), but also The Pour House, Treno Pizza Bar and Central Taco & Tequila (all in Westmont). Today it has nine restaurants in Southern Jersey and more across the bridges.
PJW Assistant Culinary Director Jacqueline Platzer was recognized by the Garden State Culinary Arts Awards for her part in creating PJW's core and seasonal menus.
The Newcomers | Dominic and Lindsay Piperno Owners, Hearthside BYOB, Collingswood
When the Pipernos opened Hearthside in Collingswood in 2017, they did what you might think was impossible. Their New Jersey restaurant quickly began racking up "Best New Restaurant in Philadelphia" accolades, including from Food & Wine. Among their other early honors was a Best New Restaurant nomination from Bon Appetit and a Garden State Culinary Arts Award for Best New Restaurant in the state.
With its hearth as a focal point, an evolving seasonal menu and impeccable service, Hearthside gets raves from all quarters, and is easily the hardest-to-land reservation in South Jersey. Chef Dominic Piperno leads the kitchen, while Lindsay's vision inspires front of house.
The couple has announced plans to open a wine bar nearby, and South Jersey eagerly awaits whatever comes next from this team.

Texto completo: Rajon Lynch's ties to Appleton — the one-time home of Harry Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
One thing Rajon Lynch is unable to escape? His ties to Harry Houdini.
Not that he'd want to.
The 23-year-old magician who in recent years performed around the Appleton area, including at the History Museum at the Castle and Houdini's Escape Gastropub, has found a new job in a new city. He's now the director of the Houdini Museum of New York.
His ties to Appleton — the one-time home of Houdini, history's most famous magician — didn't land him the job. But it certainly didn't hurt.
"I think it definitely piqued his interest," Lynch said of the museum's owner, Roger Dreyer, who hired him in September. "Being from Appleton, when I started getting in the papers and stuff, the main thing was Houdini was old and Appleton might be looking to revive magic. Because I started writing about that stuff, I felt like I had a good grasp in terms of what people want from magic."
Houdini famously claimed to be a native of Appleton, though he came here as a child from Budapest, Hungary, and left well before finding fame. Lynch, who performs as RJ the Magician, is a native of Racine who came to this area for college — he earned a communications degree from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in the spring — and often performed in Appleton while in school.
In 2017, he launched a dinner-show program called "Now Serving Magic," which was hosted at times by Houdini's Escape, the History Museum and Oshkosh's Time Community Theater.
He spent the summer after graduation teaching magic in China. That's where he was when he was first contacted about the opening at the Houdini Museum, which is found in the same city Houdini now rests. The great illusionist is buried in a cemetery in Queens.
Opened in 2012, the museum itself is a small, a one-room showcase on the fourth floor of a Midtown Manhattan building, but it houses more than $3million in memorabilia. With cuffs, posters, keys, a coffin and a trunk from the famous "Metamorphasis" stunt, it's the largest public collection of Houdini items.
One of the goals of the Houdini Museum, according to the official website, is to "inspire all age groups to realize once you focus and set your mind on something, you can accomplish anything you desire." It's fitting, then, that shortly before Now Serving Magic was starting in Wisconsin, Lynch told The Post-Crescent his plans after college were simple: "I want to be in New York," he said.
The operation also includes the Fantasma Magic Shop, which Lynch now oversees. He said they often sell magic kits to kids, and he joked he sometimes feels like "black Santa."
"You don't see magic shops around anymore," said Lynch, who owned a Fantasma kit as a child. "When my parents were younger, like every neighborhood (in New York) had a magic shop where you could go and learn some tricks. Now it's all converted to online."
Besides peddling magic wares, the duties he took on in September include giving tours, producing magic shows, performing and chatting up the guests.
He also helps market the museum, something he's already getting the hang of. In his few short months he's been covered by New York's ABC, NBC and Fox affiliates, AM New York and The New York Times. (And now, of course, The Post-Crescent.)
As a young, black magician with a background linked with Houdini, he knows he has a story hook.
"I was able to learn that I kind of had a knack for writing, especially about magic," he said. "And that's probably why I got this job, because I love magic, I love people and I love making connections like that."
RJ the Magician returns Rajon Lynch, a.k.a. RJ the Magician, will be back in northeast Wisconsin for a performance with two other magicians. The event is at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 24 at Tim Community Theater, 445 N. Main St. in Oshkosh. RJ will perform with Caleb Hyatt and Noah Sonie. Hyatt is based in Milwaukee and Sonie is from Minnesota. Tickets start at $15 and are available at eventbrite.com.

Texto completo: AL-UYAYNAH, Saudi Arabia - Ghazi Al-Anazi and his business, Ghazi Tours, take up to 900 visitors a month on treks like one to a dry riverbed dotted with acacia trees north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
But he is confident those numbers are about to multiply, as Saudi Arabia begins to open itself up as a major tourist destination. The government recently began issuing tourist visas for the first time, a remarkable shift for a traditionally shuttered society.
And it goes far beyond that: Billions of dollars are being poured into vast tourism projects throughout the kingdom in a bid to shift the economy away from its dependence on the petroleum industry and the government jobs it finances.
Visiting Saudi Arabia has long been a difficult proposition for everyone except Muslim pilgrims going on the hajj and business travelers. For decades, historic sites have been largely ignored, and hotels and travel services were scarce outside major cities.
Unemployment among Saudi nationals is about 12%. But the government figures that the travel industry, which employs about 600,000 people, can be expanded to create up to 1 million more jobs, as the need for everything from drivers, chefs and guides to hotel managers and archaeologists expands.
The move toward tourism was devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 34-year-old chief policymaker, whose Vision 2030 program seeks to diversify the economy, draw in more outside investment and expand the private sector.
The Saudis are hiring international real estate executives and introducing elaborate advertising campaigns to try to put themselves on the map. Already, there are signs the push is paying off: Saudi hotel room sales in the first nine months of 2019 increased 11.8% from the same period last year.
But a question hanging over the whole initiative, some travel experts say, is how many people will want to visit an ultraconservative kingdom that's the subject of intense criticism over its treatment of dissenters and women, that restricts the use of alcohol and until recently barred unmarried couples from sharing rooms.
Referring to the vast golden vistas, "I call it the new yellow oil," said Amr Al Madani, the chief executive of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula, a region in the northwest part of the kingdom that is roughly the size of New Jersey.
Al-Ula includes the evocative ruins of an ancient city of carved rock tombs, called Mada'in Saleh. Like Petra, a popular tourist draw in southern Jordan, the city was built by the Nabataeans about 2,000 years ago.
The vast region has only 45,000 residents. There are some existing resorts, and France's Accor chain recently agreed to manage one. Madani is planning an investment of up to $20 billion, from a mix of public and private sources, to finance airport expansion, hotels and other facilities to accommodate up to 2 million visitors drawn to archaeological sites as well as food and cultural attractions.
An even more ambitious scheme is under construction on Saudi Arabia's western coast. The Red Sea project covers a remote area with 120 miles of coastline, more than 90 islands and extensive coral reefs that could one day be a diving and snorkeling paradise.

Marriage is dead? Not in America

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes. The critically-acclaimed new movie, "Marriage Story," described by its costar Adam Driver as a "love story about divorce," provides viewers with an intimate and often raw glimpse into the demise of a marriage in New York City and Hollywood.
Pop cultural offerings like these give the impression that many marriages are messy and miserable, and the descent into divorce is rampant nowadays.
Or take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing."
But the story of the death of marriage has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce and the collapse of the institution of marriage, the reality is that there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s,offering their children a better shot a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, nonmarital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
The rate of nonmarital childbearing has fallen from 41.% in 2009 to 39.6% in 2018. We think what has happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upward. Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock mean more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has risen to 62.6% in 2019,says our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upward in the coming years.
What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.
All of this is good news for our children. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.
W. Bradford Wilcox is director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia and a senior fellow of the Institute for Family Studies. Alysse ElHage is editor of the Institute for Family Studies blog.

WHY 2019 HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR EVER

Texto completo: If you're depressed by the state of the world, let me toss out an idea: In the long arc of human history, 2019 has been the best year ever.
The bad things that you fret about are true. But it's also true that since modern humans emerged about 200,000 years ago, 2019 was probably the year in which children were least likely to die, adults were least likely to be illiterate and people were least likely to suffer excruciating and disfiguring diseases.
Every single day in recent years, another 325,000 people got their first access to electricity. Each day, more than 200,000 got piped water for the first time. And some 650,000 went online for the first time, every single day.
Perhaps the greatest calamity for anyone is to lose a child. That used to be common: Historically, almost half of all humans died in childhood. As recently as 1950, 27% of all children still died by age 15. Now that figure has dropped to about 4%.
"If you were given the opportunity to choose the time you were born in, it'd be pretty risky to choose a time in any of the thousands of generations in the past," noted Max Roser, an Oxford University economist who runs the Our World in Data website. "Almost everyone lived in poverty, hunger was widespread and famines common."
But . but . but President Donald Trump! But climate change! War in Yemen! Starvation in Venezuela! Risk of nuclear war with North Korea. .
All of those are important concerns, and that's why I write about them regularly. Yet I fear that the news media and the humanitarian world focus so relentlessly on the bad news that we leave the public believing that every trend is going in the wrong direction. A majority of Americans say in polls that the share of the world population living in poverty is increasing - yet one of the trends of the last 50 years has been a huge reduction in global poverty.
As recently as 1981, 42% of the planet's population endured "extreme poverty," defined by the United Nations as living on less than about $2 a day. That portion has plunged to less than 10% of the world's population now.
Every day for a decade, newspapers could have carried the headline "Another 170,000 Moved Out of Extreme Poverty Yesterday." Or if one uses a higher threshold, the headline could have been: "The Number of People Living on More Than $10 a Day Increased by 245,000 Yesterday."
Many of those moving up are still very poor, of course. But because they are less poor, they are less likely to remain illiterate or to starve: People often think that famine is routine, but the last famine recognized by the World Food Program struck just part of one state in South Sudan and lasted for only a few months in 2017.
Diseases like polio, leprosy, river blindness and elephantiasis are on the decline, and global efforts have turned the tide on AIDS. Half a century ago, a majority of the world's people had always been illiterate; now we are approaching 90% adult literacy. There have been particularly large gains in girls' education - and few forces change the world so much as education and the empowerment of women.
You may feel uncomfortable reading this. It can seem tasteless, misleading or counterproductive to hail progress when there is still so much wrong with the world. I get that. In addition, the numbers are subject to debate, and the 2019 figures are based on extrapolation. But I worry that deep pessimism about the state of the world is paralyzing rather than empowering; excessive pessimism can leave people feeling not just hopeless but helpless.
Readers constantly tell me, for example, that if we save children's lives, the result will be a population crisis that will cause new famines. They don't realize that when parents are confident that their children will survive, and have access to birth control, they have fewer children. Bangladesh was once derided by Henry Kissinger as a "basket case," yet now its economy grows much faster than America's and Bangladeshi women average just 2.1 births (down from 6.9 in 1973).
Yes, it's still appalling that a child dies somewhere in the world every six seconds - but consider that just a couple of decades ago, a child died every three seconds. Recognizing that progress is possible can be a spur to do more, and that's why I write this annual reminder of gains against the common enemies of humanity.
Climate change remains a huge threat to our globe, as does compassion fatigue in the rich world, and it's likely that we will miss a U.N. target of eliminating extreme poverty by 2030. Meanwhile, here in the United States, Mr. Trump presents a continuing challenge to our institutions, and millions of families have been left behind and are struggling. We should keep pressing on all these fronts (the last one concerns me enough that it's the topic of my new book), but we'll get a morale boost if we acknowledge the backdrop of hard-won improvement.
"We are some of the first people in history who have found ways to make progress against these problems," says Mr. Roser, the economist. "We have changed the world. How awesome is it to be alive at a time like this?"
"Three things are true at the same time," he added. "The world is much better, the world is awful, the world can be much better."
I also take heart from the passion so many - especially young people - show to make the world a better place. I recently published my annual "gifts with meaning" guide and suggested four organizations to support in lieu of traditional presents. Readers have so far donated more than $1.6 million to those organizations, saving and transforming lives at home and around the world.
So I promise to tear my hair out every other day, but let's interrupt our gloom for a nanosecond to note what historians may eventually see as the most important trend in the world in the early 21st century: our progress toward elimination of hideous diseases, illiteracy and the most extreme poverty.
When I was born in 1959, a majority of the world's population had always been illiterate and lived in extreme poverty. By the time I die, illiteracy and extreme poverty may be almost eliminated - and it's difficult to imagine a greater triumph for humanity on our watch.

Texto completo: The masses arrived with coolers overflowing with Miller High Lifes and Sam Adams. At the nearby docks, fishermen unloaded their catch and fended off wailing sea gulls. The air smelled of salt and fish. Inside the No Name Restaurant, tons of seafood were broiled and fried and peddled at bargain prices.
“This place was a destination," remembered Pam Roberts, who graduated from Simmons College in 1980 and flocked to the seafood joint each summer after exams. “Half the fun was standing outside with a six-pack. If the wait was over an hour, you just got two six-packs. A whole mess of friends. Pure chaos. And it was wonderful."
The restaurant on South Boston's Fish Pier shook some of its rough-and-ready charms over the years, but it remained a hot spot — until Monday night.
The No Name announced Monday that it would be shuttered immediately. Bankruptcy documents show it owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to creditors including the Massachusetts Port Authority, the City of Boston, and several seafood companies.
What's more, the No Name stopped paying property taxes in 2013, and Boston has put a lien on the property. No Name owes the city close to $700,000 in back taxes including interest, according to city records.
“It's a significant sum of money. We don't take it lightly," said Emme Handy, chief financial officer for Boston.
Handy said the city has a “99 percent collection rate" because it is first in line to be paid. Asked why the city hasn't taken further action to collect taxes, Handy said it can take several years and can involve pursuing a foreclosure proceeding.
While the dollar amount is sizable, that is not what is unusual about the No Name situation, said Handy.
“To me what stands out a little more is zero dollars of payment from 2014 to 2020. That is striking to me," she added.
A lawyer for No Name did not return e-mails seeking comment Tuesday. The restaurant thanked its customers and employees on its Facebook page Monday night and said that, “After over 100 years, we had to make the difficult decision to close the No Name Restaurant."
The establishment filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which provides for the liquidation of property and the distribution of assets to creditors. Staffers learned of their looming unemployment only 24 hours prior, during a management meeting Sunday night.
The sudden closure — on the day before New Year's Eve, no less — was an unceremonious end to a storied 102-year-old Boston establishment that manifested the American dream and served a diverse cast of locals and tourists over the years.
The oldest continuous family-owned restaurant in Boston, the No Name traces its history back to a small hole-in-the-wall eatery founded in 1917 by John Contos. He'd arrived in Greece as a penniless 16-year-old, then worked 80 to 90 hour weeks to keep his new restaurant afloat. The no-frills, cheap seafood joint was aimed at the fishermen and warehouse workers toiling away in the neighboring business.
“Originally, the place was supposed to be called Deluxe Diner," Contos's son Nick told the Globe in 1997. “My father planned to cater to all the men who worked on the Fish Pier. But word got around about the restaurant, and soon people were coming from all over. There wasn't any sign out front. That's how the place got its name. Since it didn't have a sign, customers started calling it the No Name."
Rick O'Connor secured a summer job at the restaurant in the 1960s and recalls a boiling hot kitchen full of chowder cauldrons, scalding dishwashers, and hard workers who never complained.
“Papa John [Contos] would send me down to the boats for haddock and I'd bring them up in a basket. He'd send me back down, and by the time I returned he'd have all the previous haddock seared fileted and frying," said O'Connor.
In the spring of 1967, the restaurant renovated to become a mere 40 inches wider and serve five dozen (rather than three dozen) customers. Three years later, back when the chowder sold for 95 cents, Globe staffer Anthony Spinazzola called the No Name “one of those places about which people say, 'Don't write about it, you'll spoil it.' "
But for the next half-century, people kept writing about it. The Tampa Bay Times, San Diego Union-Tribune, and The New York Times all sent correspondents to cover the No Name. The restaurant cemented its place alongside other Boston seafood staples like Anthony's Pier 4, Legal Sea Foods, and the Union Oyster House. Celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse stopped by in 2002. Politicians like Michael Dukakis and Mitt Romney gave it a shoutout during their campaigns. Cambridge-born comedian Lenny Clarke told the Globe in 2009 he took all out-of-towners to the No Name, calling it “the best buy in town."
Jessica Nazario, 30, ate what turned out to beher final meal at the restaurant a couple months back. She estimated she'd been there more than 50 times.
“It's the staff and the familiarity that makes it a staple of Boston. Everything is changing so much, but No Name has always been there, and we've always felt comfortable going," she said.
Her father Jose Perez immigrated from El Salvador in 1980 and began driving a cab shortly thereafter. For a decade, passengers pointed him to the No Name and he ate there himself. Every weekend. And nearly every weekday. The restaurant offered a discount for cabbies, and the staff served him extra shrimp on his already towering broiled shrimp sautee plate.
“Every time I was there, I felt like I was at home," said Perez.
Within 15 hours of the management's Monday night announcement, more than 450 people had commented online with messages of shock and nostalgia. Some like, Perez, had eaten there recently. But most, like Pam Roberts, recalled memories and meals from bygone eras and a Seaport without sleek skyscrapers, sky lounges, and Sweetgreen.
Despite the fond memories of its patrons, though, it was clear that the No Name was struggling.
“When places like this go, people argue to save them for nostalgia's sake, but they haven't patronized them in decades," said Robert Maguire, a hospitality consultant and advocate for service industry workers. “Nostalgia doesn't pay the rent in a competitive environment."
After John Contos's death, his son Nick took over the No Name's management. Since Nick's death in 2004, the restaurant has remained in the family. Members of the Contos family did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the Globe regarding the sudden closure and bankruptcy filing.
In a farewell Facebook post Monday night, the family wrote: “To our employees, many of whom have been with us for decades, we cannot thank you enough — we thank you for your tireless dedication and hard working service."
On Tuesday afternoon, a message taped to the restaurant's front door read, “We will be closed today for a management meeting. Happy Holidays." By then, staffers — old and young — hadworked their last shift at the No Name. And the century-old haunt had turned off its fryers, stopped its shipments, and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.

A MIXED 2020 VISION; This year, there is reason to be optimistic for a bit of progress on some of California's most pressing issues -- along, of course, with more tumult

Texto completo: Here we go again, starting off on a new year and a new decade. The year is 2020, and my vision is too, so here's what I see coming:
The sea will rise, the ground will shake, the fires will rage, the state will sue the Trump administration every Tuesday and sometimes on Thursday, some people will flee, others will arrive, the cost of housing will rise, the number of homeless people will grow, and the bullet train will not leave the station.
Wait a minute, that was last year's prediction.

Actually, call me naive, but I'm going to go out on a limb this year and predict a bit of movement in 2020 on new strategies to address homelessness.
Do not misread that. I said "a bit of." Homelessness is here to stay in California, where wealth drives up prices, we don't build enough new housing, and far too many people earn wages that don't cover the rent.
But the public demand for solutions has heated up, and the state is exploring ways to put more roofs over more heads.
And if all goes as planned, a Hollywood pilot program based on an Italian model will begin an ambitious effort to shred bureaucracy and other impediments to housing and serving the area's most severely mentally disabled residents.
The project is fraught with challenges, but this early in the year, I'm pretending to be an optimist.
Except when it comes to the Dodgers.
Stop wondering when they're finally going to win another World Series. I can tell you right now the next victory parade will be in 2038, when Clayton Kershaw's son is in the starting rotation. The Dodgers signed an $8-billion-plus broadcast deal with the devil in 2013, leaving thousands of loyal fans without TV coverage, and I hereby predict the blackout curse will not end for another 18 years.
The Clippers, however, will win the NBA championship. No, not the Lakers, who don't work as hard as the Clippers. Write it down and take me to lunch when it happens.
Speaking of lunch, I predict this will be the year the Los Angeles Times corrects a grave oversight and adds Los Tacos, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, to its list of best restaurants.
This is not food you should eat. It's food you deserve to eat, especially if you just lost your job, someone left you, or Donald Trump gets reelected.
Go with the #3 combination, and thank the heavens you live in a corner of the world where you can get cheese enchiladas at 3 a.m., should the need arise (open 24 hours, and I once had lunch there with billionaire Eli Broad, I kid you not).
While I'm on the subject of restaurants, I'm reminded of my pet peeve of 2019.
You walk into a restaurant, they ask if you have a reservation, you say yes, and they say "perfect."
They ask if you'd like tap water or bottled water, you say tap, and they say "perfect."
They ask if you'd like anything else, you say no just the bill, and they say "perfect."
My question:
Why?
This is all the more reason to eat at Los Tacos. Nobody says "perfect," and they might not even talk to you, which is OK.
Another pet peeve of 2019: the New York Times telling Californians how we're doing or how we're feeling.
"It's the End of California As We Know It," we were informed in October. The NYT explained to us rubes that "at the heart of our state's rot" is "a failure to live sustainably."
We are not without sin, but as I pass another electric car, look beyond a cluster of windmills and into the glare of solar farm reflections, huh?
Then, this week, the NYT began its latest doomsday story with a flimsy anecdote about someone who had lived in the Bay Area since 2004, ran for office in San Francisco, lost, and moved to Denver with her family because of California's many problems.
Good riddance, say I.
"California is at a crossroads," said the NYT.
Guess what? Everybody is; every city, every state is at a crossroads.
The country is at a crossroads.
We've got a president who said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and get away with it, and it turns out he wasn't kidding.
A president, I might add, who is actively and aggressively trying to pollute our air and water, who believes scientists are crackpots, who is an inspiration to white supremacists, who has whiffed on all his major campaign promises (a list topped by cheaper, better healthcare for all), but for all that could still get reelected.
That, my friends, is a nation at a crossroads.
California, to be clear, does indeed have major social and economic problems, which we don't need help identifying, thank you very much, New York Times. And it also has major assets.
Kind of like New York.
Except that New York doesn't have our beaches, and in the year 2020, in the noble cause of beach access for all, Gov. Gavin Newsom and I will kayak together from Gaviota State Park to Hollister Ranch.
A few months ago I got a call from Newsom's office asking if I could meet him in Gaviota, so we could paddle north. I had written about the Hollister residents' long fight to keep us locked out, and their argument that if the great unwashed want to visit, they can test the often treacherous waters and attempt to visit by sea.
Jerry Brown never asked me to go kayaking. Ronald Reagan didn't call and say, hey, let's go for a horseback ride, amigo. Arnold Schwarzenegger never invited me to go hiking (though he once called and asked me to meet him in Long Beach for a cigar, and I happily obliged).
But this year, if Hollister residents continue to flout the public's constitutional right to access all the state's beaches, they will have to answer to me and the governor and a motley flotilla of scurvy sea dogs. We will arrive by sea, plant a flag and fight to the death. You read it here first.
Bear with me now, because if you're stealing a break from the Rose Parade, or a ballgame, or you're having trouble lifting your head off a pillow, I have just one last observation to share before you embrace the new year.
It's sad to note that two more newspapers in California have ended their run, as reported by my colleague Brittny Mejia. Sierra County's Mountain Messenger, once published by Mark Twain, and the Martinez News-Gazette, which I used to read daily, are going out of business.
Those losses -- the silencing of voices -- are blows to the community and to the mission of keeping the bastards honest.
No newspaper operates without blind spots and deficiencies, but there is no bigger news operation west of the Hudson than the Los Angeles Times, and no greater source of accountability journalism in California.
In this, my 45th year as a journalist, my colleagues in sports, in entertainment, in foreign, national, state and local news, are a daily inspiration, and I'm proud to be their colleague.
I'm still a reader first and learn multitudes each day by going online or by turning pages.
Thanks to subscribers for your continued support (and shame on those who read without subscribing). In these tumultuous political times, I'm reminded of the Thomas Jefferson quote on the old Times parking lot in downtown Los Angeles:
"Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter."
Happy new year.

Durst says he wrote 'cadaver note'; Defense backtracks on letter pointing police to home where Susan Berman was killed.

Texto completo: Robert Durst admitted to writing a cryptic note that police have long believed was penned by the person who shot and killed Susan Berman inside her Benedict Canyon home nearly two decades ago, according to a court filing made public last month.
The so-called cadaver note -- an anonymous letter sent to Beverly Hills police containing only Berman's address and the word "cadaver" -- has been considered a critical piece of evidence in Durst's pending murder trial, ever since the scandal was vaulted back into the public eye by the 2015 HBO documentary series "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst."
Durst's legal team has repeatedly denied Durst wrote the note and fought to block handwriting experts from testifying at the New York real estate scion's murder trial. But in a Dec. 24 court filing, the defense abruptly reversed course on the issue.

After noting that Durst "vigorously objected to the introduction of evidence at trial from a forensic document examiner" that identified him as the author, his defense team said it was making a "strategic decision" to acknowledge that Durst wrote the document described as the "cadaver note," according to the filing.
The development was first reported by the New York Times.
Durst's lead defense attorney, Dick DeGuerin, said in an emailed statement: "We will not be publicly discussing strategy or evidence. This does not change the fact that Bob Durst did not kill Susan Berman and doesn't know who did."
Calls and emails to representatives for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office were not immediately returned.
In 2015, shortly after the HBO series revitalized public interest in Durst and his suspected involvement in three killings across the U.S., the millionaire was arrested in New Orleans in connection with Berman's 2000 slaying.
Police believe Durst killed Berman, a crime writer and longtime confidante who sometimes acted as his unofficial spokeswoman, to prevent her from disclosing information about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife, Kathleen.
The cadaver note was believed to have been written around the same time Berman died, and investigators have long believed the author of the note also killed her. In the HBO series, Berman's stepson was shown discovering a letter Durst wrote to Berman in 1999 with the word "Beverly" spelled incorrectly as "Beverley." The same error was made on the cadaver note.
The note has been a fixture of the Los Angeles Police Department's investigations into Durst for nearly two decades. In 2002, LAPD detectives obtained a writing sample while Durst was awaiting trial in Galveston, Texas, for the killing of his elderly neighbor, Morris Black.
Under a judge's orders, Durst scribbled the words "BEVERLEY HILLS POLICE," "1527 BENEDICT CANYON" and "CADAVER," the sum total of what was contained in the cadaver note.
After claiming that a gun fired while he was defending himself during a tussle with his neighbor, Durst was acquitted by a jury of Black's murder.
The Texas fact-finding mission followed an earlier mistake by the LAPD. In February 2001, just months after Berman was killed, an LAPD handwriting expert concluded it was "highly probable" that the note was written by Berman's manager, Nyle Brenner, not Durst. After investigators obtained fresh writing samples from Durst in 2002, the same expert reversed himself and concluded Durst was the author.
Superior Court Judge Mark E. Windham has barred the expert's analysis from being introduced as evidence at Durst's trial, calling the conclusion "garbage" during a hearing last year.
Jury selection in Durst's trial is tentatively scheduled to begin Feb. 10, though the proceedings could last into the summer.

Texto completo: If your only sense of the state of our unions is drawn from the pop culture and the prestige press, you probably think marriage in America is on the ropes.
Take the messages about marriage we get from the media. The New York Times recently ran an op-ed, "Beyond Marriage," from an eminent family scholar suggesting that marriage is "disappearing." Elsewhere, Brookings Institution fellow Isabel Sawhill warns, "marriage is in trouble and, however desirable, will be difficult to restore."
But the story of the death of marriage, told in popular and elite venues, has been greatly exaggerated, to paraphrase Mark Twain. While movies like "Marriage Story" and Times op-eds do their part to perpetuate the cultural myths of widespread divorce and the collapse of the institution of marriage, the reality is that there is good news to report about the state of our unions and state of the American family. If we look at three key trends over the last decade in the United States, there are bright spots on the family horizon.
1. Divorce is on the rocks First, divorce is down. In fact, the divorce rate has been falling since it peaked around 1980, at the height of the divorce revolution. According to our analysis, the divorce rate has fallen by nearly 25% over the last decade to the point where there are about 15 divorces per 1,000 married people today — about the same rate as in 1970. And scholars predict that the divorce rate will continue to fall.
Surveys tell us that Americans are less tolerant of divorce today. That's in large part because, as family scholar Richard Reeves put it, "Modern marriage is not principally about money, sex, or status. It's about children." Today's married couples seem to invest more in staying together, unlike the Boomers who were obsessed with their own fulfillment in the '70s, offering their children a better shot at a more stable family life and future.
2. Children following marriage Second, non-marital childbearing is down. As Lyman Stone explained at the Institute for Family Studies, though the reasons for the decline are complex, "we are actually approaching a decade of falling births to unmarried women."
Since 2009, the rate of non-marital childbearing has fallen from 41% to 39.6% in 2018. We think what's happened, in part, is that young adults in America have become more cautious in the wake of the Great Recession about forming families and, hence, are less likely to leap into parenthood without a ring on their finger.
3. Two-parent households And, finally, the share of children being raised in intact, married families is ticking upwards.
Although family instability and single parenthood are still too high, less divorce and fewer babies born out of wedlock means more stable, married families in America. Since bottoming out in 2014, we've seen a small increase in the share of children being raised by their own married parents. Specifically, the share of children being raised in intact, married families bottomed out at 61.8% in 2014 and has now risen to 62.6% in 2019, according to our analysis of Census data. We expect this number to keep heading upwards in the coming years.
What does all this mean for American children? Children raised by their married parents enjoy a host of life-long benefits compared to children born into other family forms, including more financial stability, greater physical safety, more involved fathers, and greater educational, social and psychological outcomes.
And, as we have seen, those who are privileged to be born into married-parent families today are less likely than children in the past few decades to witness their parents' divorce, sparing children the grief that often follows the death of their parents' marriage.
All of this is good news for our children, good news that has been obscured in recent pop cultural and media depictions of marriage in America. It should encourage us to do a better job of promoting the facts about the benefits of marriage to the rising generation, even as we try to help them form stronger marital bonds.

Texto completo: Kim Jong-un said North Korea was free of a self-imposed pause on testing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, which President Trump had called a diplomatic victory.
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, said his country no longer felt bound by its self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, its official media reported on Wednesday, the strongest indication yet that the country could soon resume such tests.
Mr. Kim also said the world would witness a new strategic weapon "in the near future," according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency, though no details were provided.
North Korea has not conducted a long-range missile test or a nuclear test in more than two years. Mr. Kim had announced his moratorium at a time when he hoped negotiations with the United States -- and his budding personal relationship with President Trump -- would prompt the United States to begin lifting crippling sanctions.
Mr. Trump, who has met Mr. Kim three times, has often cited the North's restraint as a major diplomatic achievement. Speaking with reporters Tuesday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Mr. Trump said he still had a "very good relationship" with Mr. Kim.
The North had set a Dec. 31 deadline for the United States to make at least some concessions, complaining that its 18 months of diplomacy with Mr. Trump had yielded limited results. And for weeks, American officials feared Mr. Kim might test an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, to make his point.
During the party meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Kim said his country "will shift to a shocking actual action" that will make the United States "pay for the pains sustained by our people," the North Korean news agency said.
It remained unclear if a test was imminent. It is possible that Mr. Kim's announcement on Wednesday is, by itself, the warning shot he wants to send to prod Mr. Trump, on the eve of a presidential election year, to begin lifting sanctions.
All of the North's state media gave prominent coverage to Mr. Kim's remarks, indicating that they may have replaced an annual New Year's Day speech that he had been expected to deliver. In its New Year's Day edition, the North's main party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, filled its front page with Mr. Kim's remarks, including an exhortation to his people to "foil the enemies' sanctions."
Mr. Kim, who had hoped to shift his focus to finally reviving his country's economy, has been growing frustrated in recent months as his negotiations on denuclearization with the Trump administration have stalled.
He made the latest remarks about the moratorium on Tuesday, the last day of a four-day meeting of the Workers' Party Central Committee, the North's highest decision-making body. The remarks threatened a major shift in North Korean policy.
He stressed that North Korea "should more actively push forward the project for developing strategic weapons" now that Washington's "gangster-like acts" have stymied economic growth.
The unprecedented rapprochement between the United States and North Korea began nearly two years ago, after months of nuclear and ICBM tests and threats from both sides. Two months after Mr. Kim announced his moratorium -- saying he had now completed his nuclear force -- the two leaders met in Singapore in June 2018 in the first summit meeting between the two countries.
The summit ended with a commitment to "work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," but the pledge was never understood the same way by the two sides. The administration insisted that meant Mr. Kim would give up his nuclear weapons, his stockpile of fissile material and his missiles, but the North argued that it also meant the United States would withdraw troops and offshore ships and submarines that could launch nuclear weapons.
Subsequent negotiations have failed to close the gap.
Mr. Trump, speaking in Florida on Friday night, cited the Singapore pledge and said he considered Mr. Kim to be a "man of his word."
"I know that he is sending out certain messages about a Christmas present," Mr. Trump added, reprising a line he had used before, "and I hope his present is a beautiful vase."
But Mr. Kim's words on Tuesday were much harsher. "If the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the D.P.R.K., there will never be denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula," he said, using the initials for the North's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. "The scope and depth of bolstering our deterrent will be properly coordinated depending on the U.S. future attitude to the D.P.R.K."
That remark, and Mr. Kim's reluctance to clarify when North Korea would officially resume testing, indicated that he might still be open to further negotiations with Washington.
While the North has demonstrated that its fleet of missiles could likely reach parts of the United States, the country still has not shown it could design a nuclear warhead that would survive the heat and huge forces that come with re-entry of a warhead into the atmosphere.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday night that the Trump administration continued to hope that Mr. Kim would "take a different course."
"President Trump came into office with the threat of war from North Korea real, and a true concern for the American people. He took a tack -- we said we can deliver a better outcome for the people of North Korea," Mr. Pompeo said in an interview with Fox News.
"We're hopeful that Chairman Kim will make the right decision, and he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war," he added.
Washington had dismissed the Dec. 31 deadline imposed by the North as "artificial," urging Pyongyang to maintain a dialogue and not revert to the provocations that had raised fears of war on the Korean Peninsula two years ago.
Since taking over his country following the death of his father and predecessor, Kim Jong-il, in 2011, Mr. Kim has accelerated his country's nuclear weapons and missile programs. North Korea has conducted the last four of its six underground nuclear tests under Mr. Kim. It flight-tested three intercontinental ballistic missile tests in 2017.
As his diplomacy with Mr. Trump has failed to bring about the benefits he had sought, especially the lifting or easing of sanctions, Mr. Kim has sounded increasingly impatient. North Korea broke an 18-month hiatus in weapons tests in May, launching 27 mostly short-range ballistic missiles and rocket since then and warning of more provocative tests to come. In December, it conducted two ground tests at its missile-engine test site to bolster what it called its "nuclear deterrent."
At the same time, Mr. Kim has exhorted his people not to expect any immediate easing of sanctions and to brace for a prolonged struggle against the Americans by building a "self-reliant" economy. David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

Texto completo: Mr. Durst, who was profiled in the HBO series, had long denied mailing a note alerting the police to a dead body. Last week, his lawyers acknowledged that he did.
On Dec. 23, 2000, someone mailed the Beverly Hills Police Department a single sheet of spiral notebook paper, across which were printed an address and a word in big block letters: "cadaver."
The address belonged to Susan Berman, who was shot and killed at her home the same day the note was sent. Police found her body the next day, but it would be another 15 years before a suspect was arrested: Robert Durst, a real estate scion who has been dogged by murder suspicions for nearly four decades.
Mr. Durst, who is scheduled to face trial in February, has long insisted that he did not kill Ms. Berman, one of his closest friends, and did not write what has become known as the "cadaver note."
In 2015, he told the producers of "The Jinx," an HBO documentary that turned his story into a national sensation, that the writer of the note had taken a "big risk" because it was something "that only the killer could have written."
His defense lawyers have repeatedly tried to block testimony from forensic document examiners who say the handwriting on the note matches Mr. Durst's. The judge in the case also rejected the lawyers' attempt to identify Ms. Berman's personal manager as the author of the note and the killer. Then, in a court document filed on Christmas Eve, the lawyers suddenly reversed course, acknowledging that Mr. Durst was the author of the note.
It is the first time that either Mr. Durst or his lawyers have conceded that he was in Ms. Berman's home, or even in Los Angeles, around the time that someone put a 9-millimeter handgun to the back of her head and fired, killing her instantly. But they continue to deny that Mr. Durst, a millionaire who will turn 77 during the trial, was involved in her murder.
"Bob didn't kill Susan Berman, and he doesn't know who did," said Dick DeGuerin, Mr. Durst's lead defense lawyer, in an interview.
Mr. Durst has been in jail since 2015, when he was arrested in New Orleans and charged with Ms. Berman's murder just hours before the final episode of "The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst" aired on HBO. The authorities said they suspected that he was about to flee the country.
The upcoming trial, which could last as long as five months, is expected to refocus the media spotlight on the long, complicated story of Mr. Durst, once considered the heir apparent to a vast New York real estate empire. Already, NBC's Dateline, ABC's 20/20 and CNN Headline News are planning episodes.
The police in Los Angeles found Ms. Berman's body in 2000 after neighbors notified them that her back door was ajar and her terriers were running free. There was no sign of forced entry. Nothing had been taken, and no fingerprints or DNA were found from the killer.
Prosecutors contend that Mr. Durst killed Ms. Berman because he feared that she was about to tell the authorities what she knew about the 1982 disappearance and murder of Mr. Durst's first wife, Kathie McCormack Durst, in New York, five months before she would have graduated from medical school.
Ms. Berman, who friends say was fiercely loyal to Mr. Durst, was his spokeswoman and media adviser at the time. Prosecutors and witnesses say she also made a critical call while posing as Kathie Durst that redirected New York police detectives away from the actual crime scene and hobbled the investigation.
The "cadaver note" that arrived at the Beverly Hills police department became a key piece of evidence in Ms. Berman's death. After clearing various suspects, the Los Angeles police got a court order in 2002 for handwriting samples from Mr. Durst to compare with the block lettering on the note.
By then, Mr. Durst was in jail in Galveston, Texas, charged with the killing and dismembering of Morris Black, a man who had lived across the hall from him. The two men became friendly after Mr. Durst left New York in 2000, when the authorities reopened the investigation into his wife's disappearance.
Mr. Durst testified during the trial in 2003 that he and Mr. Black had struggled over Mr. Durst's gun. As they fell to the floor, the gun went off, Mr. Durst said. He told the jury that he had resorted to dismemberment because he thought no one would believe it was self-defense. The jury acquitted him.
With the murder investigations in Los Angeles and New York stalled, Mr. Durst could have laid low, but in 2010 he made a decision to talk to journalists and filmmakers. He gave the producers of "The Jinx" access to his private papers, urged friends to talk to them and gave them more than 20 hours of filmed interviews.
The producers discovered new evidence, including a letter that Mr. Durst had written to Ms. Berman in 1999. In her address on the envelope, he had misspelled the first word in Beverly Hills as "Beverley." The address on the envelope of the cadaver note included the same misspelling, in similar lettering, with the first word of the Beverly Hills Police Department written as "Beverley."
"The Jinx" filmmakers confronted Mr. Durst with the earlier letter and its similarities, but he denied writing the cadaver note.
Although his lawyers now acknowledge that his denial wasn't true, a legal brief they filed in August indicates that they will likely argue that the note could have been written by someone other than Ms. Berman's killer. "What the note demonstrates is that the person who mailed it was aware that there was a body at the house, not that the individual murdered Susan Berman," the brief stated.
In interviews in 2015 and 2016 with The New York Times, one of Mr. Durst's friends, who requested anonymity out of fear of legal entanglements in the case, said Mr. Durst had privately acknowledged finding Ms. Berman's lifeless body when he went to her home on Dec. 23, 2000, and did not want her dogs to gnaw on it. But he fled after writing and mailing the cadaver note because he did not think anyone would believe he was innocent, the friend said.
But Mr. Durst also told John Lewin, the Deputy District Attorney, the filmmakers and his godson, Howard Altman, something very different. "The person who wrote the note killed her," Mr. Altman said, recalling Mr. Durst's words while he was in jail in Galveston.
Asked about those statements by his client, Mr. DeGuerin replied: "He said a lot of things that I don't think are correct."

Texto completo: Facing a public reckoning, the Trump Organization has been cracking down on its unauthorized laborers.
For years, the Trump Organization used undocumented workers to tend to its hotels, golf courses and other properties, even as Donald Trump railed against the threat of illegal immigration as both a candidate and president.
This year, faced with a public reckoning after some of those workers came forward, the organization has been cracking down.
Dozens have been fired. The company vowed to follow what was already a widespread industry practice of using E-Verify checks to confirm employment eligibility. Leaders issued messages to laborers that they would need to show proof that they could work. Immigrants from places like El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico have left their jobs.
Then, on Monday, after harvests were complete at Trump Winery in Virginia, the organization fired several more.
Anibal Romero, an immigration lawyer who has represented a number of former Trump workers and is advising one of those fired from Trump Winery this week, said the pool of undocumented laborers at Trump properties has always been an open secret.
"He's benefited from undocumented labor for a very long time," Mr. Romero said.
A year ago, a New York Times story featured undocumented workers who served at Mr. Trump's properties and had interactions with Mr. Trump himself. That article has since led to others from The Times, Univision and The Washington Post, which first reported on Tuesday the latest round of firings at Trump Winery.
Mr. Romero said he believed the Trump Organization thought it could get away with continuing to hire undocumented laborers, who feared repercussions that could disrupt their lives or livelihoods even though some had worked at Trump properties for a decade. But he said that since the Times story last year, more have emerged, empowered to speak. He now represents about 40 undocumented people who have worked at Trump properties.
"These workers have been there for many years," Mr. Romero said. "It's sad to hear about their firing. But many of them have been able to move on and get better paying jobs. At first when you hear about them, you feel bad. But then you realize that maybe it wasn't the best environment to work in."
In an audio recording from one of the firings this week at Trump Winery, a manager told a worker named Omar Miranda that the company had completed a review of immigration paperwork and found that his "did not seem genuine or was insufficient."
"Do you currently have legal permission to work in the United States?" the manager asked with the aid of an interpreter. Mr. Miranda responded that he did not.
The manager said the company would not continue employing him. She said that he was "wonderful" and that she was sad about the termination. Mr. Miranda was given six weeks of additional pay.
"If your employment status ever changes, you are welcome back, of course," she said.
Mr. Romero said he believed the Trump Organization has long known about the workers at the winery, noting that Univision had done a story over the summer focused on them.
"Getting rid of them at that point could have caused problems for the wine," Mr. Romero said. He believes property leaders waited until the grueling harvest season was complete before letting the workers go.
Mr. Trump made immigration and border security cornerstones of his campaign for the White House. He has pledged to build a border wall, while his administration has carried out aggressive tactics like workplace raids and family detention.
The president has touted himself as a champion of American workers, signing a "Buy American, Hire American" executive order in 2017 to tighten the conditions for visas for foreign workers. But his companies have continued applying for hundreds of guest worker visas.

Texto completo: "Never read the comments." It's an internet cliché. But here at The New York Times, we do read your comments -- and your emails, tweets and letters, too.
We know that our readers have great ideas, valid criticism, constructive feedback and compelling stories to share. Listening to you and incorporating your thoughts make our journalism stronger. (And, sometimes your comments are hilarious; just ask Stu and Kathy, or Christine or the unofficial NYT Cooking Comments Instagram account.)
Below are just a few times when Times readers have contributed to our report this year, and what we learned from them.
Making our journalism more transparent
Readers often inform our journalism. Their questions and feedback provide opportunities to explain how we work and grapple with difficult editorial decisions.
In January, when we published a photo showing some of the dead victims of an attack in Nairobi, Kenya, many readers thought we made the wrong call. They said the image was inappropriate, and some questioned whether we would publish similarly horrific photos after an attack in the United States or elsewhere in the West.
Whenever the question of publishing graphic images arises, many people across the newsroom are involved in hard conversations. Editors must weigh the desire to be sensitive and respectful of victims and their families with our mission to give readers a clear view of what's happening in the world.
Criticism of the Nairobi photo spurred us to revisit and clarify our guidelines for the publication of graphic images. And we asked Meaghan Looram, our director of photography, and Marc Lacey, our National editor and a former Nairobi bureau chief, to answer a selection of questions raised by readers.
"To give you a sense of how difficult these decisions are, there are people in the newsroom who felt in retrospect that we shouldn't have run the Nairobi photo," Marc wrote. "As a result of the concerns from our readers that this photo raised, we're going to convene a group of people to come up with clearer guidelines."
You can read their full answers here:

Readers also prompted us to explain why we sometimes include descriptions of a person's appearance in our political coverage.
When Vanessa Friedman, our chief fashion critic, wrote about Speaker Nancy Pelosi's burnt orange coat and our Politics reporters mentioned it in an article, some readers took issue.
"I look forward to your headline about Trump having worn a navy suit and red tie at his next press conference, and about McConnell wearing a black suit and blue tie when announcing that he won't let the Dems' bill be voted on in the Senate," read one tweet.
The feedback made us realize we could benefit from doing a better job explaining why we cover such things, so Vanessa did:
To ignore how public figures use what they wear is to ignore one of the ways our own understanding is being manipulated. I consider it part of my job as The Times's chief fashion critic to help readers understand how fashion is being used to communicate, in the same way Andrew Ross Sorkin helps us understand economic policy.
Admittedly, if this context is missing, that's our mistake; if we are going to use clothes as a signpost of related substance, that connection should be clear. (That is why we deleted our tweet that referred to Ms. Pelosi's dress: The context was missing.)
You can read her full explanation here:

Over the years, readers have asked how our editorials work: who writes them, why they're unsigned and how their views are developed.
When The Times's editorial board argued in support of the impeachment inquiry in September, James Bennet, the editorial page editor, used it as an opportunity to explain not only why the editorial board was making this argument, but also what an editorial board is -- a question he said he and his colleagues are asked constantly, including within The Times.
"The role of the editorial board," he wrote, "is to provide Times readers with a long-range view formed not by one person's expertise and experience but ballasted by certain institutional values that have evolved across more than 150 years."
You can read his full explanation here:
Building on our reporting with readers' experiences
Poignant memories and experiences shared by readers often add to our journalism, leading to articles and follow-up pieces that highlight their stories.
In May, a Times article on chest binding prompted a discussion among readers about the practice, which some transgender and gender-nonconforming people use to compress their breasts and to treat body dysphoria. We heard from readers who were upset that more voices of trans people were not included.
We then asked readers who have used chest binders to tell us why they've worn them and what effect binding has had on their lives. We heard from more than 200, mostly teenagers and young adults. Here is a selection:

After President Trump attacked four Democratic congresswomen of color in a series of tweets in July -- "Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came," he wrote in one -- we asked readers if they had ever been told to "go back." Some 16,000 responses flooded in on our website, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.
Readers recounted the insults they had heard as African-Americans, Asian-Americans, Native Americans and Jewish Americans. Many recalled first becoming aware of their "otherness" as young children and said that slurs had followed them into adulthood.
Pat St. Claire from Atlanta wrote: "It wasn't just mean kids. Even teachers would sometimes ask me where I was from with a look of disdain."
Read a selection of those 16,000 responses here:

After The Times published a Food article about how mealtimes can be difficult for widows (a gender-neutral term that bereavement counselors now use), hundreds of readers described in the comments the heartbreak and the joy that food and cooking can bring after losing a partner.
We rounded up some of those comments in this article:
Readers continued to console one another in the comments of the roundup. "I'm a nine-month widow tonight and this thread has given me some hope and a lot of comfort -- I feel that I am not alone," wrote Mary Sutton Pobedinsky from Monroe, N.Y.

Strong story ideas, straight from our readers
For years, The Times has asked readers to contribute their voices to our reporting -- usually centered on a question or a topic that our journalists would like to address. But Your Lead, a Reader Center project announced last month, is involving our readers in the editorial process even further, empowering them to act almost as assignment editors. The project asks readers to send us their questions that they want our journalists to investigate.
Our National desk and our Metro desk are piloting the experiment. National is soliciting questions about inequality in California, and Metro wants to know what questions New Yorkers have always wondered about their city. (Click those links to submit your questions.)
Here are a few of the articles that have come out of the project so far:
Readers often ask smart, thoughtful questions, which have led to new coverage.
This happened in October, in our coverage of President Trump's interactions with Ukraine's leader, which have since led to Mr. Trump's impeachment. In an article about Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine's former prosecutor general, one of the most recommended comments said, "We need clear explanations of why pressuring foreign nations to investigate political opponents threatens our democracy."
We heard this question from several readers, so one of our White House correspondents, Katie Rogers, wrote this explainer:

Lewandowski Will Not Run For Senator

Texto completo: President Trump's former campaign manager, Mr. Lewandowski, had been weighing a bid but said he would focus on Mr. Trump's re-election instead.
Corey Lewandowski, the polarizing political operative who was President Trump's first 2016 campaign manager, said Tuesday that he would not seek a United States Senate seat in New Hampshire, ending months of speculation about a run that had put some Republican state leaders on edge.
Mr. Lewandowski, who faced the prospect of a grueling primary race and a tough general election matchup against the Democratic incumbent, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, made his announcement in a series of tweets. He wrote that he was "certain" that he would have won, but had instead decided to focus on ensuring that Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020.
"I am truly humbled by the outpouring of support I have received from people across New Hampshire and the country," he said, adding that he would endorse a Republican candidate "in the near future."
A bid by Mr. Lewandowski would have had support from key parts of Mr. Trump's political apparatus in a rare race where Republicans would have a chance to pick up a Senate seat in 2020. It would also have tested the appetite for Trumpism in a purple state with a Republican governor where Hillary Clinton very narrowly won in 2016 and Ms. Shaheen won her Senate race two years earlier by less than three percentage points.
At least three Republicans are already in the contest: William O'Brien, a former speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives; Donald Bolduc, a retired Army brigadier general; and Corky Messner, a businessman and veteran.
In August, Mr. Trump all but endorsed Mr. Lewandowski in an interview with a New Hampshire radio host. "I will say this -- if he ran, he would be a great senator. If he ran and won, he'd be a great senator," Mr. Trump said in the interview.
Mr. Lewandowski helped Mr. Trump notch his first primary victory in New Hampshire in February 2016, which began Mr. Trump's march to the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Trump's children fired Mr. Lewandowski as the campaign manager less than five months later, but the president would retain a fondness for him and would speak with him often.
If he had run in New Hampshire, Mr. Lewandowski's business activities would have been the subject of intense scrutiny. While Mr. Trump has been in office, Mr. Lewandowski has been an adviser to companies that have interests with the government.
In May 2017, Mr. Lewandowski left the lobbying firm he helped start, Avenue Strategies, amid questions about whether he was lobbying without having registered. Since then, Mr. Lewandowski has had private clients and for many months gave paid speeches to various groups. Mr. Lewandowski has previously said that he was not a lobbyist, and that he had never called government officials on behalf of a client.
Nonetheless, some Republicans, both in New Hampshire and in Washington, had expressed skepticism about whether Mr. Lewandowski would ultimately enter the Senate race, in part because doing so would have forced him to file financial disclosure forms that would have provided additional details about his work.
Mr. Lewandowski has also faced allegations of assault: In 2016, during the campaign, he was accused of grabbing a reporter for Breitbart News who was trying to ask Mr. Trump questions. Mr. Lewandowski was charged with simple battery by the police in Jupiter, Fla.; the charges were later dropped. The following year, a pop singer accused Mr. Lewandowski of slapping her twice on the buttocks at a party in Washington.
In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Democratic Party sought to tie Republicans to Mr. Lewandowski and Mr. Trump even without Mr. Lewandowski in the race.
"Every Republican running for Senate in New Hampshire has stood proudly with Corey Lewandowski and Donald Trump in their efforts to take away health care from tens of thousands of Granite Staters and reverse Roe v. Wade," said the spokesman, Josh Marcus-Blank. "While Messner, Bolduc and O'Brien tear each other down in the contentious primary Lewandowski has left behind, Senator Shaheen will continue working across the aisle for New Hampshire, leading efforts to lower prescription drug costs and making sure veterans and their families get the benefits they deserve."
Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.

Dizzying Day For President Caps a Year Full of Them

Texto completo: The president monitored a Middle East crisis from his golf club, threatened Iran and implored reporters to be "honorable" in 2020.
PALM BEACH, Fla. -- It was perhaps fitting that President Trump ended another dizzying year in office with a crisis-driven day of surreal contrasts, one that began with him tracking a Middle East emergency from his golf club and ended with a tuxedo-clad president holding forth about North Korea, Iran and impeachment and vaping on a red carpet over the thumping din of party music.
Mr. Trump arrived at the $ 650-a-person annual New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago resort shortly after 9 p.m., as a packed ballroom of guests -- including his children; his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wore a green and red bow tie; and a procession of local society notables -- awaited him inside.
He weighed in on the prowess of the Marines who rushed to the American Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday to help secure diplomats there under what amounted to a siege by demonstrators whom Trump administration officials said were directed by Iran.
"We have some of our greatest warriors there," the president said. "They got in very quickly."
With his wife, Melania Trump, standing beside him in a sparkling black and gold dress, Mr. Trump said that Iran would be foolish to start a war with the United States. "I don't think that would be a good idea for Iran," he said. "It wouldn't last very long."
"I want to have peace," Mr. Trump added. "I like peace."
The president also restated his confidence in the character of the brutal North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, who warned hours earlier that he had an unspecified "shocking" action planned to repay the United States for sustained economic sanctions on his country.
Noting that Mr. Kim had previously pledged to begin a process of denuclearization -- although many experts differ with that assertion -- Mr. Trump professed little concern that his diplomacy with the North was on the rocks.
"I think he's a man of his word," the president said, adding that he still had a "very good relationship" with Mr. Kim.
And of course there was impeachment: "A big, fat hoax," Mr. Trump said, something that has been engineered by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he called "a highly overrated person."
Over pounding drums and a chorus that made it difficult to hear his words, the president renewed his complaints that European leaders, including Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, had not done more to support Ukraine.
By then it had already been a long and action-filled day for Mr. Trump after what had been a relatively peaceful holiday escape. For the better part of two weeks, he had been laying low during his vacation, shuttling back and forth between Mar-a-Lago and the Trump International Golf Club only a few miles away.
Before he stopped to talk to reporters on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump had last been seen in public on Christmas Eve morning, when he explained that his time at what he called the "Southern White House" was far from leisurely.
"I really pretty much work -- that's what I like to do, is work," Mr. Trump said in a video conference with military members serving overseas.
But White House officials have provided scant details about his daily activities, leaving the news media to speculate about what the golf-loving president was doing during the several hours per day he has been spending at his golf club.
As ever, the news media loomed particularly large in Mr. Trump's mind. He bristled on Tuesday at what he called false reports that he had hit the links amid the Iraq crisis.
"The Fake News said I played golf today, and I did NOT!" he wrote in an afternoon tweet. "I had meeting in various locations, while closely monitoring the U.S. Embassy situation in Iraq, which I am still doing. The Corrupt Lamestream Media knew this but, not surprisingly, failed to report or correct!"
And near the end of his red-carpet remarks, Mr. Trump offered a message for the news media ahead of the year that will determine if he serves another term.
"If you're honorable, I'm going to win by a lot," the president told the reporters assembled before him. "If you're not honorable, I'm just going to win the election by a little. So I'd rather have you be honorable, O.K.?"
And with that, he headed into the grand ballroom of Mar-a-Lago, and the dawn of a new year as president of the United States.

Texto completo: The senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El says we need to demonstrate that an attack on one New Yorker is an attack on all New Yorkers. Also: Security in the subways; Joe Biden's stuttering.
To the Editor:
Re "As Intruder Swung Machete, Jews Fought Back" (front page, Dec. 30):
In December 1993 in Billings, Mont., a rash of nativist rhetoric and violence culminated in an attack on a Jewish home during the festival of Hanukkah. The city responded in a remarkable way.
Recognizing that anti-Semitism is not just a Jewish issue, residents of all faiths and of no faith at all placed pictures of Hanukkah menorahs in their windows. Together, they beat back the forces of hate.
The anti-Semitic violence that has plagued our city lately has targeted members of the more traditional Jewish community, easily identifiable by the clothing they wear. Let New Yorkers respond as the people of Billings did.
The yarmulke, the Jewish ritual head covering, is worn to show humility before God. Some Jews wear them; some do not. But if we all wore them, Jews and non-Jews, men and women alike, perhaps we could demonstrate to the haters in our city that an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.
Joshua M. Davidson
New York
The writer is the senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El in New York.
Policing the Subways, and the Streets, Too
To the Editor:
Re "A Misuse of Funds for the Subway" (editorial, Dec. 23), about the decision by the financially strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority to add more police officers to patrol the system instead of spending the money on improving service:
It is heartening to read that serious crime in the subway continues to decline, but the general sense of lawlessness in the subways is most definitely not down. Fare-beating seems rampant, despite the "crackdown" your editorial mentions; panhandling is incessant; and reports of riders being slapped, pushed and groped seem to be on the rise.
We need those extra police officers in the subways to increase the sense of safety for everyday strap-hanging New Yorkers. Without that safe feeling, ridership will decline, which is not good for anyone -- the public, the M.T.A., the environment, traffic.
And while I take your point about adding officers who report to "a state-controlled authority that is less accountable to average New Yorkers," the New York Police Department has plenty of other fish to fry. Having the governor save us from needing to use additional local officers to make us feel safer deserves thanks, not opprobrium.
Joan Westmeyer
New York
To the Editor:
Right on with that editorial.
The current policing priorities it mentions do seem odd. Who decided that fare evasion or selling food in the subway was more disturbing or dangerous to us than, say, the reckless impunity of car and truck drivers breaking traffic laws?
In any single week, hundreds of drivers exceed speed limits, run lights, creep into pedestrian crosswalks and double-park in bike lanes. If extra officers are hired for transportation duty, they belong on the streets, ticketing drivers and enforcing traffic laws.
There would also be a lot of new revenue in this intervention that could be put toward further improving our quality of life.
Patty Weisenfeld
New York
Joe Biden's Stuttering
To the Editor:
Re "Joe Biden's Sharpness" (column, nytimes.com, Dec. 24):
As a physician and psychiatrist, I found David Leonhardt's article about Joe Biden's stuttering very informative. About three million Americans stutter. Mr. Biden is one of them. It would be helpful to have the candidate himself explain how he overcame his stuttering as a child and young man. This would assuage concern voters may have about what appear to be memory lapses or a lessening of his "mental sharpness."
He uses certain well-known techniques -- circumlocution or lowering his head -- to control stuttering. As Mr. Leonhardt points out, circumlocution can result in "mangled syntax." This can be misinterpreted as an indication that Mr. Biden isn't as sharp as he once was. In fact, he's used these methods all his life to counter stuttering and has been an effective senator and vice president.
Talking about this would not only be a revealing personal moment, but would also detail his overcoming a problem that would hinder almost anyone wishing to enter public life.
It could be a game changer.

Texto completo: The senior rabbi at Temple Emanu-El says we need to demonstrate that an attack on one New Yorker is an attack on all New Yorkers.
To the Editor:
Re "As Intruder Swung Machete, Jews Fought Back" (front page, Dec. 30):
In December 1993 in Billings, Mont., a rash of nativist rhetoric and violence culminated in an attack on a Jewish home during the festival of Hanukkah. The city responded in a remarkable way.
Recognizing that anti-Semitism is not just a Jewish issue, residents of all faiths and of no faith at all placed pictures of Hanukkah menorahs in their windows. Together, they beat back the forces of hate.
The anti-Semitic violence that has plagued our city lately has targeted members of the more traditional Jewish community, easily identifiable by the clothing they wear. Let New Yorkers respond as the people of Billings did.
The yarmulke, the Jewish ritual head covering, is worn to show humility before God. Some Jews wear them; some do not. But if we all wore them, Jews and non-Jews, men and women alike, perhaps we could demonstrate to the haters in our city that an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.

Texto completo: Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway's inbox makes abundantly clear how personally venomous local politics has become.
" 'Fat,' 'sick,' 'worthless,' 'gutless,' 'loser,' " she said, reciting some of the insults that have been leveled at her since becoming mayor of Madison, Wisconsin, in April.
She got a taste of the animosity during her campaign, when she was criticized on blogs and social media not for her plans for housing, stormwater management or transportation, but for not wearing makeup.
"People are angry, or afraid, and express themselves in mean ways," she said.
Rhodes-Conway is not alone in facing this type of abuse. As many as 79% of mayors in the United States report being the victim of harassment, threats or other psychological abuse, according to a recent study. Thirteen percent also reported instances of physical violence.
And one factor - gender - stood out above all others as a predictor of whether a mayor would be targeted. Using a statistical analysis that took into account factors like time in office, the researchers concluded that female mayors were more than twice as likely as their male counterparts to experience psychological abuse and almost three times as likely to experience physical violence.
The study, published in the academic journal State and Local Government Review, and interviews with current and former mayors, lay bare today's harsh political climate, in which threats of violence over social media are constant and speaking out can be perceived as a political weakness.
"We're seeing more women get elected into political office everywhere at the same time that there are increasing threats against all public officials," said Mona Lena Krook, a political science professor at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. "Men also face violence, but women face more and more types of violence."
And the ease of making threats on social media is driving the abuse, said Sue Thomas of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, lead author of the paper.
"Social media is absolutely toxic to women politicians. It's much more virulent to me as a woman than as an out lesbian," said Annise Parker, who was mayor of Houston for three two-year terms. "Remarks about the way I look, what I weigh or how I dress - aspects of femininity - escalate into threats of physical violence."
And when Karen Weaver made history in Flint, Michigan, by becoming its first female mayor - amid a burgeoning water crisis in 2015 - she believed that she would have more support to discuss the issues facing the city, she said.
On social media, she said, "They went after me like I wasn't a person and had no feelings or family."
In all, 16% of the 238 mayors who responded to the survey said their experiences of abuse had them thinking about leaving their office, suggesting that the toxic environment also threatens to scare off mayors who are interested in long careers and higher political office.
"Folks who have everything it takes to succeed, win an election and be a terrific public servant, that's why they say no," said Christopher Cabaldon, mayor of West Sacramento, California, since 1998. He added that on social media it's "open season on politicians and their families. It definitely warps what our local democracy looks like."
He said that he had been able to remain in office for more than two decades, in part, because he is single and has not faced the discomfort of having a spouse or relative attacked.
"People don't know it until they experience it," said Parker, who is now the chief executive of the LGBTQ Victory Fund, which helps train candidates for office. "It doesn't keep people out, but it burns people out once they're in it."
For Heather McTeer Toney, the first woman and the youngest person, at 28, to serve as mayor of Greenville, Mississippi, the menace arrived in her mailbox, not her inbox.
The words were written on a yellow sheet of paper, torn off from a legal pad, in black, blue and red ink, and the ones that explicitly threatened rape were written in red. It was more disturbing in a way, she said, that someone took the time to write a letter and mail it.
"It's 15 years later, and I can still remember that," said McTeer Toney, who was also the first black person in the post. "Trust me, this is something that I want to forget."
Mark Barbee, 29, a restaurant server who leads Bridgeport, Pennsylvania, a city of 5,000 about 20 miles northwest of Philadelphia, said he received death threats after winning election in 2017. City Council meetings have been especially contentious. His proposal for an anti-discrimination policy only increased the ire directed at him.
Barbee, a gay African American, said that the difficult times - during which some supporters told him his advocacy was "not worth your life" - forced him to contemplate leaving office.
The survey also found that mayors who are younger, in strong chief executive systems and in larger cities were more likely to be affected by violence and abuse.
And then there is the political calculation that comes with speaking out about the abuse: Will the public be sympathetic to a mayor who is complaining?
"Politicians have an image to keep up," Krook said. "That's particularly hard for women. If you potentially show some weakness, people can really jump on that."
Many mayors seemed to have reluctantly accepted the abuse as part of serving in office but have come up with their own methods of coping.
Rhodes-Conway does not engage with the attacks that come over social media, but her office reads everything, she said. "If I were reading this every day, it would be just awful," she said. "I feel for mayors who have less of a staff or less of a filter. This is really painful."
Instead, she combats the barrage of nastiness by visiting coffee shops around the city, where she and her staff buy drinks for residents, many of whom arrive upset and talk for an hour. "Even when people disagree with me face to face, they are polite," she said.
Mayor Lovely Warren of Rochester, New York, said she went so far as to shut down her personal Facebook account for nearly three years.
"When you get into a fight with the pig, you get dirty, and the pig likes it," she said, paraphrasing advice given by her family.

Building a new tourist mecca Saudi Arabia embarks on projects to reinvent itself as a vacation destination

Texto completo: AL-UYAYNAH, Saudi Arabia - Ghazi Al-Anazi and his business, Ghazi Tours, take up to 900 visitors a month on treks like one to a dry riverbed dotted with acacia trees north of Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
But he is confident those numbers are about to multiply, as Saudi Arabia begins to open itself up as a major tourist destination. The government recently began issuing tourist visas for the first time, a remarkable shift for a traditionally shuttered society.
And it goes far beyond that: Billions of dollars are being poured into vast tourism projects throughout the kingdom in a bid to shift the economy away from its dependence on the petroleum industry and the government jobs it finances.
Visiting Saudi Arabia has long been a difficult proposition for everyone except Muslim pilgrims going on the hajj and business travelers. For decades, historic sites have been largely ignored, and hotels and travel services were scarce outside major cities.
Unemployment among Saudi nationals is about 12%. But the government figures that the travel industry, which employs about 600,000 people, can be expanded to create up to 1 million more jobs, as the need for everything from drivers, chefs and guides to hotel managers and archaeologists expands.
The move toward tourism was devised by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom's 34-year-old chief policymaker, whose Vision 2030 program seeks to diversify the economy, draw in more outside investment and expand the private sector.
The Saudis are hiring international real estate executives and introducing elaborate advertising campaigns to try to put themselves on the map. Already, there are signs the push is paying off: Saudi hotel room sales in the first nine months of 2019 increased 11.8% from the same period last year.
But a question hanging over the whole initiative, some travel experts say, is how many people will want to visit an ultraconservative kingdom that's the subject of intense criticism over its treatment of dissenters and women, that restricts the use of alcohol and until recently barred unmarried couples from sharing rooms.
Referring to the vast golden vistas, "I call it the new yellow oil," said Amr Al Madani, the chief executive of the Royal Commission for Al-Ula, a region in the northwest part of the kingdom that is roughly the size of New Jersey.
Al-Ula includes the evocative ruins of an ancient city of carved rock tombs, called Mada'in Saleh. Like Petra, a popular tourist draw in southern Jordan, the city was built by the Nabataeans about 2,000 years ago.
The vast region has only 45,000 residents. There are some existing resorts, and France's Accor chain recently agreed to manage one. Madani is planning an investment of up to $20 billion, from a mix of public and private sources, to finance airport expansion, hotels and other facilities to accommodate up to 2 million visitors drawn to archaeological sites as well as food and cultural attractions.
An even more ambitious scheme is under construction on Saudi Arabia's western coast. The Red Sea project covers a remote area with 120 miles of coastline, more than 90 islands and extensive coral reefs that could one day be a diving and snorkeling paradise.

Self-checkout on Sundays sparks battle in France

Texto completo: ANGERS, France - On a Sunday afternoon, customers at a Géant Casino supermarket browsed the aisles and lined up to buy groceries. It was a typical shopping experience except for one thing: All the cashiers had gone home. Customers scanned items at automated checkout stations as security guards hovered nearby.
That the store was even open was unusual. French labor rules prohibit most shops from employing workers past 1 p.m. on Sundays. But as e-commerce and online giants like Amazon usher in an era of round-the-clock spending, retailers are amping up the use of automated cashiers to help them compete.
The move has caused an outcry in France, where Sundays are traditionally a rest day for workers and families. While self-checkout machines are often used alongside cashiers, labor unions say tilting toward fully cashierless operations threatens the French way of life by encouraging American-style consumerism and automation, putting thousands of jobs at risk.
"Sundays are sacred," said Patrice Auvinet, the head of the General Confederation of Labor union in Angers, a midsize city in western France. "If they change that, it will change French society."
Groupe Casino, the country's biggest supermarket operator, began testing Sunday-afternoon openings in August using only automated machines at the warehouse-sized supermarket in Angers. It has expanded the experiment to at least 20 other megastores around the country, igniting raucous protests.
Casino further riled unions recently by becoming the first supermarket chain in France to keep most of its stores open - including the one in Angers - on Christmas Day using only self-checkout machines. Casino said in a statement that it planned to do the same on New Year's Day, and that the move was an extension of how it was already operating on Sunday afternoons.
"We're in a very competitive environment," said Sébastien Corrado, the marketing director of Groupe Casino. "The internet doesn't have frontiers, so we need to adapt to new modes of consumption that let us stay in the game and be winners."
Ringing up more profit is especially important for Groupe Casino, which also operates supermarkets in South America and Asia. It is restructuring billions of euros of debt after its holding companies recently entered a form of bankruptcy protection.
At the Angers store, which employs 115 in a working-class neighborhood, Groupe Casino is having salaried employees clock out as usual at 12:30 p.m. on Sundays, then bringing in security guards, hired through another company, to keep the store open through evening.
Groupe Casino's huge supermarkets, like the one in Angers, employ thousands, often on urban outskirts with limited job opportunities. That first Sunday afternoon in August, 200 demonstrators converged on the Angers store, chanting angrily and accusing the company of taking a big step toward replacing employees.

Local Jews defiant after anti-Semitic attack in NY Annapolis supporters celebrate Hanukkah at menorah lighting

Texto completo: A day after a man cloaked in a scarf barged into a New York rabbi's home and stabbed five people, members and supporters of Annapolis' Jewish community lit eight torches in celebration of Hanukkah.
Nearly 50 people huddled under a forest of umbrellas as sheets of rain beat down on City Dock, where a new light in a 15-foot electric menorah is illuminated each night of the eight-day holiday. Sunday is the last night of Hanukkah, a time that commemorates spreading light in the world to dispel hatred. Attendees were also defiant.
"We're happy to be Jews. We're proud to be Jews. And nothing will stop us," Rabbi Nochum Light said to the crowd.
The menorah lighting kicked off with a procession of 20 cars topped with illuminated menorahs parading to City Dock. People danced in their cars and blasted songs like Adam Sandler's "The Hanukkah Song" and "Oh Hanukkah" by The Maccabeats. People gathered around a 15-foot menorah, which needs a scissor lift to reach the top. When the lift jammed, Light stuck the torches in the railing of the lift.
Despite pouring rain, children and families were in high spirits, singing, praying and sharing latkes together.
"Rain, where?" said Aloys Evers, a member of Chabad of Anne Arundel County, where Light is a rabbi.
Saturday's violence in New York is being condemned as an act of domestic terrorism. The attacker was identified as Grafton Thomas, 38, who screamed "I'll get you" during the attack, the New York Times reported.
Thomas, wielding a machete, allegedly stabbed five people, one of whom was stabbed six times, at a synagogue in a house, the Times reported. Police have not yet disclosed a motive. Thomas has been charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of first-degree burglary. Chabad of Anne Arundel County is a synagogue in Rabbi Light's home.
"It knocks a little closer," Evers said.
Two weeks ago, a deadly shootout between police and two people who opened fire on a Jewish market in Jersey City left the country's Jewish community devastated. In 2018, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting at the Tree of Light synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Evers, who drove a car topped with a menorah and has been attending the event for 10 years, said he never stopped checking the surroundings for danger.
"It's kind of scary to do this sometimes because you're scared something is going to happen," said Maya Evers, his daughter.
Fire fighters and police escorted the parade on its route to City Dock, a reassurance for Maya and her sister Mariel.
"It is scary, but the sense of community brings us together and we're more proud than ever," Mariel said.
In line with the holiday, Annapolis residents stood together and brought light to the dark, rainy night.
"This is representational of the power of coming together and embracing each other and remembering what is important to us as a community, as a faith and for all of our cultures," said William Rowell, director of public engagement and community relations for the City of Annapolis.

Texto completo: My crystal ball got a little cloudy in 2019, so as the new year dawns, join me in what the late, great New York Times columnist Bill Safire liked to call the 'office pool,' where, as he put it, 'every reader becomes a pundit.' Some of my suggested answers are fanciful, some entirely serious. But whatever the news brings, a happy 2020 to all.
1) During 2020, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will: (a) take the additional title of prime minister and declare elections for a Saudi parliament; (b) offer China a larger role in the development of his futuristic city of Neom; (c) expand commercial and academic ties with Israel and announce an interfaith study center in Riyadh; (d) create a royal commission to ensure that the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi could never happen again.
2) For North Korea's Kim Jong Un, the biggest challenge of 2020 will be: (a) establishing a Central Committee department to research possible quid pro quos to offer President Trump; (b) worrying about what life might bring if his 'great friendship' with Trump doesn't endure past Inauguration Day 2021; (c) signing an accord on the White House South Lawn for a joint U.S.-North Korean nuclear research and real estate investment program.
3) Iranian politics will be rocked during 2020 by: (a) Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's nomination of hard-line chief justice Ebrahim Raisi as his chosen successor; (b) a campaign by Quds Force leader Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani to blame the 'authorities' for instability and violence in Iran; (c) a comeback try by former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pitching Trump-style populism; (d) all of the above.
4) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will demonstrate his impulsive independence during 2020 by: (a) secretly helping Russia install a new government in Libya, replicating Moscow's Syria intervention; (b) threatening to impound U.S. nuclear weapons at Incirlik Air Base unless he can keep U.S. F-35 fighters and a Russian air-defense system to shoot them down; (c) building a lavish 'Turkey Loves Trump' spa and resort in Bodrum run by Trump family pal Mehmet Ali Yalcindag; (d) annexing the northern Cyprus territory that has been under Turkish control since 1974, with Vladimir Putin's acquiescence, in return for recognizing Russian annexation of Crimea.
5) Chinese President Xi Jinping's biggest headache in 2020 will be: (a) stopping Hong Kong protests without killing thousands of Chinese demonstrators; (b) suppressing Internet and press freedom in Taiwan following the reelection of President Tsai Ing-wen in January; (c) resisting pressure from the People's Liberation Army to abolish the rival Ministry of State Security and incorporate its intelligence functions within the PLA; (d) all of the above.
6) The economic surprise of 2020 will be: (a) the Justice Department files an antitrust suit against Amazon; (b) the Dow Jones industrial average falls below 20,000; (c) Facebook merges with NBCUniversal; (d) the European Union announces that, because of the unpredictability caused by overuse of U.S. sanctions, all European finance will be 'de-linked' from the dollar; (e) the corporate debt bubble begins to burst as a result of several high-profile downgrades and defaults; (f) none of the above.
7) The political surprise of 2020 will be: (a) President Trump replacing Mike Pence with Nikki Haley as his running mate; (b) Joe Biden announcing that, if elected, his vice presidential nominee Stacey Abrams will attend all National Security Council and CIA briefings; (c) Republican Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), defeated for reelection to Congress, opening a global private intelligence group called 'NeverSteele'; (d) Trump ordering the U.S.-military to guard polling places to prevent 'massive voter fraud' on Election Day.
8) The 'sleeper' military crisis of 2020 will be: (a) Russian deployment of hypersonic nuclear weapons for which the United States has no defense or counterpunch; (b) Chinese space weapons that can blind U.S. spy satellites, hack communications satellites and limit projection of military power; (c) new bioweapons being developed by China, Russia and other countries that can target specific populations " and create super- empowered warriors that are tougher, faster and smarter than others on the battlefield; (d) all of the above.
Extra credit: By the end of 2020, which country will have eradicated 'extreme poverty' as defined by the World Bank? Which will have the largest economy, as measured by the CIA and IMF? Which will lead AI competitions for voice recognition, facial recognition and financial technology?
Answers: 1) all except d; 2) a; 3) d; 4) a; 5) d; 6) f; 7) b; 8) d; Extra credit: China, China, China.

Texto completo: The entertainment business has been in a perennial state of change pretty much since the Lumiere Bros. first showed their short films in 19th-century Paris.
But few periods have brought the degree of upheaval as this past decade. The collision of new technology, a massive creative boom, major corporate reorganizations and shifting consumer preferences " and a social revolution " has ensured that the more things change in Hollywood, the more they go completely topsy-turvy.
Here's a countdown, in descending order, of the 12 most influential moments in the U.S. entertainment business over the past 10 years.
12. Fox announces plans to sell to Disney (December 2017) Arguably no personality has shaped the current media landscape like Rupert Murdoch, whether it was with Fox News, the Fox Network or kingmaking newspapers all over the world. With the decision to sell his huge film and television studio business two years ago, he telegraphed that he didn't want to continue being in the A-list content-creation business anymore; when it came to scripted entertainment, at least, he was mainly happy to distribute the content of others. Thus ended a momentous era for Murdoch " and a century-old studio behind some of the most iconic films ever made.
11. Spotify hits 5 million paid subscribers globally (December 2012) Not that long ago, the notion of music as a product we would consume mainly by subscription seemed a little strange. Album sales were where the money lay, with stores and sites pushing the latest collection from our favorite artists. Or with song downloads a la iTunes. But the Swedes of Spotify showed a different way " a subscription way. They weren't first, but they were the most formidable. When the company hit this threshold seven years ago this month, we knew they were here to stay. Apple and other competitors would soon ratchet their efforts, and the way artists sold music " the way we listened to music " changed forever.
10. 'John Carter' flops (February 2012) You probably don't even remember 'John Carter.' And that's exactly the point. When this decade began, the biggest hit in theaters was also one of the biggest hits in history " 'Avatar,' which would go on to take in $2.74 billion worldwide. It did that by making use of 3-D technology, which looked for all the world like it would change the film game. But the years that followed would demonstrate that the form was more novelty than reality. Studios didn't want to produce it, audiences didn't want to see it and no one wanted to pay extra for it. A seminal moment in that swift decline? The failure of 'John Carter,' a 3-D science-fiction spectacle that cost Disney more than $300 million to make and promptly opened in the United States to . . . $30 million. The company took a $200 million write-down on the film and fired its then-studio chief, Rich Ross. And now finding a big 3-D blockbuster is as rare as coming upon a mine of unobtainium.
9. Fortnite Battle Royale is released (September 2017) The video game industry has seen some huge hits over the years. But few came in the form of Fortnite Battle Royale. The Epic Games creation, which sees players fight for survival using novel items on a contained island, combined networked game play, intricate worlds, humor, action and high skill levels in ways that had rarely been attempted before. But maybe most important, it perfected a very modern model: A free-to-play game that makes much of its revenue via in-world microtransactions. Last year, Epic generated $2.4 billion in revenue from its Fortnite properties.
8. Court finds in favor of AT-T-Time Warner (June 2018) A large telco and a giant content company coming together seemed like a good idea on paper. But could it pass legal muster? Courts, after all, have not always looked favorably on such vertical integration. That was the stumbling block to the creation of WarnerMedia, which aimed to combine the reach of a phone company with the content-well of a media giant. The Department of Justice argued that this would give one firm too much power. A federal court said otherwise, ruling that the $85 billion merger didn't pose antitrust concerns. The ruling not only opened the door to the creation of a new megalith " it cleared the way for other media mergers.
7. 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'NCIS' and 'American Idol' slide badly (May 2019) If one wanted to capture the decline of network television " essentially the dismantling of an entire platform that once regularly gathered large numbers of Americans for a shared experience " over this past decade there are no shortage of places to look. The five major English-language networks suffered drops through much of the 2010s, as audiences in this era of prolific programming became fragmented and went digital. But a look at where some of the longest-running network hits finished last May demonstrates just how steep the declines have been. 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'NCIS' and 'American Idol,' which were all going strong in 2009, each finished 2019 with at least 20 percent fewer viewers than they began the decade. ('Idol' finished down some 67 percent.) A telling metric: the most-watched non-sports show last season ('The Big Bang Theory') garnered an average of 18-million viewers. The most-watched non-sports show in 2009-2010 ('Idol'): an average of 23 million viewers. Oh, and 'Big Bang' is now off the air.
6. Disney opens 'The Avengers' (May 2012) Superhero movies have been around for decades. But Joss Whedon's 'The Avengers' changed everything when it was released in 2012. With it came not just a huge hit but the idea of the shared film universe " the zeitgeisty concept that suggests franchises don't just continue as linear sequels but via overlapping characters across a sprawling set of movies (the Marvel Cinematic Universe, in this case). The idea was game-changing because it not only allowed for cross-promotion between numerous movies but for a studio to develop and produce several installments in a franchise simultaneously. That has regularly yielded multiple films the same year " and made fans, Wall Street and shareholders very happy. Just ask Disney: MCU films have grossed $22.6-billion worldwide.
5. 'Game of Thrones' changes discourse with 'Red Wedding' episode (June 2013) Before 'Game of Thrones,' the idea that so many people could come together over television that didn't air on a broadcast network was pretty rare. And that such TV could be fueled by a fever on social media really hadn't been contemplated. Then 'GoT's' 'Red Wedding' episode happened. Robb Stark and his men were killed, Twitter and Facebook blew up, and the idea of social media as a place where we gather to express shock, amazement and anger about entertainment solidified " indeed, the very way audiences consume television changed.
4. Disney announces its plan to buy Fox (December 2017) Yes, it happened at the same moment as No. 12. But the significance looks very different from the other side. As an entertainment giant, Disney was already well positioned to take on Silicon Valley giants such as Netflix. But with Bob Iger's announcement that the company would spend $52.4 billion (later $71.3 billion) to buy key Fox assets meant a new frontier. Disney, which had previously beefed up with purchases of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, was now in full supersize mode. The move would set the table for streaming service Disney Plus, and make the idea that one giant company could produce so many fan favorites either a thrilling or scary reality.
3. #OscarsSoWhite Movement is birthed (January 2015 and January 2016) The Academy of Motion Picture Arts - Sciences has struggled with diversity challenges for many years. But when all 20 of the acting nominees were white in 2015, and then again in 2016, the tide turned. A movement led by activist April Reign and anchored by a potent hashtag was founded; high-profile celebrities threatened a boycott; and change, finally, was enacted. The academy amended its new-member process and began admitting far more people of color, with a goal of doubling its diversity by 2020. In the past two years, the group has welcomed nearly 2,000 new members, with a significant percentage of them being people of color. At the 2019 Oscars, people of color populated many of the acting and other categories, while 'Black Panther' became a force.
2. The New York Times and the New Yorker run Harvey Weinstein articles (October 2017) When the New York Times and New Yorker ran stories, within just a few days of each other, detailing a decades-long pattern of alleged sexual abuse and assault by film mogul Harvey Weinstein, it changed everything. Other high-profile people in media and entertainment would come to be accused and fired " Matt Lauer, Leslie Moonves and Kevin Spacey, to name just a few. A new accountability had arisen; a new consciousness was formed. And the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements were born.
1. Netflix unveils 'House of Cards' (February 2013) Go through the concepts that define the current entertainment climate. Streaming Wars. Bingeing. Peak TV. Cord-cutting. Pretty much all of them can trace their roots to one moment: when Netflix, with a little-known playwright and screenwriter named Beau Willimon, took a flier on a different kind of series. When it launched 'House of Cards' that winter's day " dropping the whole season's episodes at once " it didn't just unveil a political soap opera. It didn't just transform what had been basically a digital library service into an original-content powerhouse. It changed how we watch television, where we watch television, what we expect from television and how every other rival might produce and release television. Frank Underwood's camera address was the turn that launched a thousand streams. And it changed the business of entertainment forever.
