Texto completo: It was only a matter of time before some dense journalist in the national media uncovered the invisible link connecting recent violence at places of worship to — who else? — President Trump.
After a gunman shot up a church in Texas and a knife-wielding psycho attacked Jews celebrating Hanukkah at a Hasidic rabbi’s home in New York, Jeremy Peters of the New York Times said what was on the minds of precisely no one.
“You have to wonder,” he said Monday on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, “at what point the rhetoric, not just on social media but in the media that a lot of the president’s supporters consume, in the media that the president himself often speaks to [is responsible].”
Peters went on to push the (debunked!) theory that the El Paso, Texas, Walmart shooter had been inspired by Trump’s position on immigration.
As of now, we know very little about the two attackers. We don’t even know the identity of the church shooter, who was shot dead by a volunteer security officer. We know that the suspect in the knife attack, Grafton Thomas, whose family says has a history of mental illness.
And that’s it. We know nothing about either person’s motive, their political leanings, or whether they were driven into a blind rage by watching the misfits of Morning Joe make a lot of bad points on TV. (At some point, you have to wonder.)
Thomas, a black man, is at least statistically unlikely to admire or support Trump. But so long as we’re making connections where there is no solid evidence of them, the stabbings at the rabbi’s home look quite similar to the shooting at a New Jersey kosher market earlier this year, wherein six people were killed and the suspects were black, one of them tied to an anti-Semitic organization.
Peters has no reason at all to link Trump and his supporters to any of the recent violence targeting religious people, but this is what he and the rest of the national media do. They look at an ugly incident and think to themselves, how can I make this about Trump?

Texto completo: A day after a man cloaked in a scarf barged into a New York rabbi's home and stabbed five people, members and supporters of Annapolis' Jewish community lit eight torches in celebration of Hanukkah.
Nearly 50 people huddled under a forest of umbrellas as sheets of rain beat down on City Dock, where a new light in a 15-foot electric menorah is illuminated each night of the eight-day holiday. Sunday is the last night of Hanukkah, a time that commemorates spreading light in the world to dispel hatred. Attendees were also defiant.
"We're happy to be Jews. We're proud to be Jews. And nothing will stop us," Rabbi Nochum Light said to the crowd.
The menorah lighting kicked off with a procession of 20 cars topped with illuminated menorahs parading to City Dock. People danced in their cars and blasted songs like Adam Sandler's "The Hanukkah Song" and "Oh Hanukkah" by The Maccabeats. People gathered around a 15-foot menorah, which needs a scissor lift to reach the top. When the lift jammed, Light stuck the torches in the railing of the lift.
Despite pouring rain, children and families were in high spirits, singing, praying and sharing latkes together.
"Rain, where?" said Aloys Evers, a member of Chabad of Anne Arundel County, where Light is a rabbi.
Saturday's violence in New York is being condemned as an act of domestic terrorism. The attacker was identified as Grafton Thomas, 38, who screamed "I'll get you" during the attack, the New York Times reported.
Thomas, wielding a machete, allegedly stabbed five people, one of whom was stabbed six times, at a synagogue in a house, the Times reported. Police have not yet disclosed a motive. Thomas has been charged with five counts of attempted murder and one count of first-degree burglary. Chabad of Anne Arundel County is a synagogue in Rabbi Light's home.
"It knocks a little closer," Evers said.
Two weeks ago, a deadly shootout between police and two people who opened fire on a Jewish market in Jersey City left the country's Jewish community devastated. In 2018, 11 people were killed in a mass shooting at the Tree of Light synagogue in Pittsburgh.
Evers, who drove a car topped with a menorah and has been attending the event for 10 years, said he never stopped checking the surroundings for danger.
"It's kind of scary to do this sometimes because you're scared something is going to happen," said Maya Evers, his daughter.
Fire fighters and police escorted the parade on its route to City Dock, a reassurance for Maya and her sister Mariel.
"It is scary, but the sense of community brings us together and we're more proud than ever," Mariel said.
In line with the holiday, Annapolis residents stood together and brought light to the dark, rainy night.
"This is representational of the power of coming together and embracing each other and remembering what is important to us as a community, as a faith and for all of our cultures," said William Rowell, director of public engagement and community relations for the City of Annapolis.

THE KHASHOGGI COVER-UP GOES ON

Texto completo: An editorial from The New York Times
The death sentences handed down by a Saudi court to five anonymous men in the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul only add another level of infamy to the foul murder. The claim by the Saudi prosecutors, who report directly to the royal court, that Khashoggi was killed in a "spur of the moment" decision defies all the evidence that points to a premeditated extrajudicial assassination - the bone saw the assailants brought along, the gruesome chitchat taped by Turkish intelligence, the Khashoggi look-alike who was filmed walking out of the consulate after the killing.
The court was closed to all outsiders save a few diplomats sworn to secrecy, and the identities of the five condemned men and three others sentenced to prison were not made public. But all the evidence unearthed since Khashoggi, who was living in self-imposed exile in the United States, was throttled and dismembered inside the consulate leaves little doubt that the powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the hit, and that a team of operatives flew to Turkey to carry it out. The fact that two organizers of the execution, Crown Prince Salman's close adviser Saud al-Qahtani and the former deputy head of intelligence, Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, were acquitted for lack of evidence serves only to make the convictions less credible.
But then it is reasonable to assume that the goal was not to put on a convincing trial, much less a fair one. Crown Prince Mohammed knows what really happened and who did it, and after the storm of international censure and revelations since Khashoggi's death on Oct. 2, 2018, he must understand that beheading the executioners - if that's who have been sentenced to death - will not make his culpability go away. "Mockery," "laughable lies" and "a sham" are only a few of the reactions from human rights experts and the Turkish government that followed the sentences.
There is nothing to show that Crown Prince Salman has been humbled by the global outcry over the murder, as he has continued to crack down against any sign of dissent in his kingdom. The cynical conclusion is that he staged the trial and threw a few underlings to the dogs to give friendly foreign leaders - including President Donald Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has a chummy relationship with the prince - a pretext for carrying on with business as usual.
The sentences were announced shortly after Mr. Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act, in which Congress included a directive to the director of national intelligence to provide a list of officials complicit in Khashoggi's murder within 30 days.
It's doubtful that any such report will change Mr. Trump's approach to the crown prince, especially given the disdain he has exhibited for the intelligence services, or dissuade businesspeople from seeking lucrative Saudi deals.
But the pretense that justice has been even remotely served must not be given any credence, at any level. And nobody should mistake Crown Prince Salman for the benign reformer he once pretended to be, or let him believe he has closed the chapter on the barbaric extermination of a troublesome critic.

Texto completo: Mr. Lewis said he had Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, but would return to Washington to continue work and begin treatment.
WASHINGTON -- Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and an icon of the civil rights movement, announced on Sunday that he had advanced pancreatic cancer, but planned to return to Washington to continue work and begin treatment.
"I have been in some kind of fight -- for freedom, equality, basic human rights -- for nearly my entire life," Mr. Lewis, 79, said in a statement. "I have never faced a fight quite like the one I have now."
Survival rates for pancreatic cancer are grim, and Mr. Lewis said his cancer was Stage 4, the most advanced. Mr. Lewis said that while he was "cleareyed about the prognosis," doctors had told him that advances in medical treatment would help give him "a fighting chance."
"I have decided to do what I know to do and do what I have always done: I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the beloved community," Mr. Lewis said. "We still have many bridges to cross."
Mr. Lewis said that doctors determined he had the cancer during a routine medical visit this month and that subsequent tests confirmed the diagnosis. His treatment plan will continue for several weeks.
"I may miss a few votes during this period, but with God's grace I will be back on the front lines soon," Mr. Lewis said.
Pancreatic cancer, which will be diagnosed in about 56,700 people this year in the United States, is the country's third-leading cause of cancer deaths, behind cancers of the lung and the colon. Three-fourths of people struck with pancreatic cancer die within a year of diagnosis, while only about one in 10 live for five years or longer.
Born on a sharecropping farm, Mr. Lewis has spent his life fighting for racial integration and civil rights, rising through the ranks of the civil rights movement before taking office. As the representative of Georgia's Fifth Congressional District since 1987 and the dean of the Georgia delegation, he is seen by many Democrats on Capitol Hill as the conscience of the caucus.
"You're not alone in this fight, my friend," Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island, wrote on Twitter. "The whole nation, which owes you an incredible debt, is with you."
"John, know that generations of Americans have you in their thoughts & prayers as you face this fight," Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted, adding, "We know that you will be well."
A practitioner of what he likes to call "good trouble, necessary trouble," Mr. Lewis was an early advocate of nonviolence, even as he suffered brutal, senseless beatings. Arrested 40 times between 1960 and 1966, he endured and survived numerous days in jails, as well as the Bloody Sunday march in 1965 over the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala. He is also a veteran of the 1960s Freedom Rides and lunch counter protests, and is the sole surviving speaker from the March on Washington in August 1963.
"If there's one thing I love" about Mr. Lewis, former President Barack Obama tweeted, "it's his incomparable will to fight. I know he's got a lot more of that left in him. Praying for you, my friend."

Why the Dazzling Skyline Always Glows

Texto completo: The lights are dazzling. But there are several other practical reasons that they stay on all night long.
Manhattan's glittering skyline makes Aja Corliss feel proud to live in New York City, and its soaring buildings represent her ambition to move upward in life.
But one night, while taking the subway to her apartment in Lower Manhattan, Ms. Corliss wondered, "Why are those lights still on?"
Ms. Corliss, 24, posed her question to The New York Times, noting that despite being "in love with the nighttime cityscape views," she is concerned about how much energy all those lights drain. Her question is part of a project from The Times that invites readers to join in our reporting process.
Con Edison, the utility that provides power to New York, estimated that 5,200 megawatt-hours of electricity keep Manhattan lit overnight.
"The reality of this is, about 99 percent of those lights need to be on at night," said John Catuogno, the director of resource planning and forecasting at the utility. "Aside from decorative lighting, people need to live, trade and work."
Here's a breakdown of why the lights stay on, and why some people want to dim them.
Residents live in tall buildings
Many towers serve as office space, but others are residential buildings. In both kinds of skyscrapers, emergency exits usually stay lit -- even when many New Yorkers are sleeping.
Some lights are required to help keep aircraft from crashing
The Federal Aviation Administration generally requires that buildings higher than 200 feet, or about 20 stories, be lit or marked by light. On some of Manhattan's larger towers, for instance, a red light blinks atop a long antenna.
For new buildings that are slated to exceed 200 feet, the F.A.A. asks developers to complete an aeronautical study to determine whether the structure needs lights to avoid potential hazards to airplanes and helicopters.
People love the view
Instagram teems with photos of the lights in New York, and tourists seem to particularly enjoy the vista, whether they are gazing at billboards in Times Square or taking helicopter and boat tours for a bird's-eye view of skyscrapers, including the iconic Empire State Building.
The building, which is usually lit in its signature white, has embraced some decorative lighting -- orange for Halloween, green for Eid al-Fitr, blue and orange for the New York Knicks -- since the Bicentennial in 1976, when red, white and blue shone from its top.
Anthony E. Malkin, the chief executive officer of Empire State Realty Trust, which runs the Empire State Building, said the tower's external lighting system was overhauled in 2011 with energy-efficient LED bulbs and a new control system that can display 16 million color combinations.
Those lights shut off at 2 a.m., Mr. Malkin said, with one exception. "If movie studios are filming New York City, and they're filming at 2, 3 or 4 a.m.," he said, "they reach out to us and ask us to leave the lights on."
The Empire State Building's internal lights have been mostly retrofit with motion detector sensors, he added. If light is coming from one of its windows, it is likely that someone is inside.
But CO2 and light pollution can be a problem
Lighting is more energy-efficient than it was only five or 10 years ago, but the night skyline is still responsible for about 1.7 billion pounds of planet-warming CO2 a year, said Mr. Catuogno.
The 1.7 billion pounds account for about 1.5 percent of the city's annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to an estimate by Con Edison.
In June, New York State pledged that by 2050, all of its electricity would come from carbon-free sources.
Light pollution is also a scourge for nocturnal animals, interfering with reproduction and migration. Birds, for example, that are drawn to light may crash into buildings, particularly ones with transparent or reflective windows.
These collisions kill as many as 230,000 birds in the city every year, according to New York City Audubon.
Some have fought to dim the lights
Donovan J. Richards, a councilman from Queens, has been trying to dial back internal and external lighting in the city since at least 2015, when he sponsored a bill that would have required thousands of buildings to turn off or dim lights overnight.
"I think one of the most important strategies we can have as a city is to conserve energy," Mr. Richards said. "It's a no-brainer that if you're not using your lights, turn them off."
He added: "I have a 3-year-old son who practices this. He knows he has to go to bed and turn his lights out. If a 3-year-old has the discipline to turn the lights out when he's not using them, then there's no reason that New York City can't find its way to do that, too."
The 2015 bill ultimately languished, with opponents -- including real estate and food industry leaders -- saying that dimmed lights would threaten public safety.
Others expressed worry over playing favorites, if government workers were to choose which destinations were notable enough to stay aglow.
In 2016, the city began requiring owners of midsize buildings to retrofit lighting systems in nonresidential spaces. It also required them to ensure that lights are off when a room is not occupied and set efficiency standards for exterior illumination.
"New York City is leading globally on reducing emissions, and we will keep doing so to reach our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050," said Julia Arredondo, a City Hall spokeswoman. "Our retrofit programs are reducing emissions, making our air cleaner and ensuring New Yorkers are healthier."

Texto completo: There are many lenses through which to look at books in the decade just past. But one thing is certain: Women writers were a powerful force.

Early in the decade, bestseller lists were dominated (sorry) by E.L. James Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, which sold 35 million copies in the United States  making the novels the three bestselling books of the decade in any genre.

As the decade ends, the current book-selling champ is Michelle Obama with her memoir, Becoming. With more than 10 million copies sold worldwide (fueled by an unprecedented rock-star book tour), it was the bestselling book of 2018 and might take the 2019 title. Another contender is Delia Owens, a 70-year-old wildlife biologist whose first novel, Where the Crawdads Sing, is an unlikely phenomenon, selling more than 4.5 million copies and spending 30 weeks at No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list.

What these books have in common, and what they share with many other notable books of the decade, is that they were written by women. According to the NPD Group, a market research company that analyzes fields including book-selling data, women wrote eight of the 10 bestselling books between 2010 and 2019. (The only men on the list are John Green with The Fault in Our Stars and Stieg Larsson with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo  both, by the way, books about female characters.)

Its not just a matter of copies sold, either. Many of the decades major book prizes were won by women. Take fiction awards: Five of the 10 National Book Awards went to women  Jesmyn Ward won two, for Salvage the Bones and Sing, Unburied, Sing  as well as seven of nine National Book Critics Circle awards (but only two of nine Pulitzer Prizes).

The decade has seen an extraordinary run of literary fiction by women, starting in 2010 with Jennifer Egans amazing A Visit From the Goon Squad. It was followed by such standout books as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichies Americanah, Donna Tartts The Goldfinch, Lauren Groffs Fates and Furies, Elizabeth Strouts My Name Is Lucy Barton and many, many more.

And, of course, there is the comeback novel of the decade, Margaret Atwoods darkly stellar The Handmaids Tale, published in 1985 but suddenly relevant. Atwood followed it up this year with a timely sequel, The Testaments.

Popular fiction by women included juggernauts like Gillian Flynns Gone Girl, Paula Hawkins The Girl on the Train and Veronica Roths Divergent series. Suzanne Collins The Hunger Games was published in 2008, but it ranks as the No. 4 bestseller of this decade with 8.7 million copies.

Women wrote major works of nonfiction as well. The decade had barely begun when Rebecca Skloot published The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks; the same year saw publication of Isabel Wilkersons The Warmth of Other Suns. Other nonfiction standouts include Elizabeth Kolberts The Sixth Extinction, Katherine Boos Behind the Beautiful Forevers and Jane Mayers Dark Money.

There have been a number of stunning memoirs by women since 2010, including Patti Smiths Just Kids, Helen Macdonalds H Is for Hawk, Margo Jeffersons Negroland, Cheryl Strayeds Wild, Roxane Gays Hunger, Valeria Luisellis Tell Me How It Ends and Tara Westovers Educated. The true crime genre is exploding in popularity, and much of it is written by women, such as Ill Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara, Furious Hours by Casey Cep and American Fire by Monica Hesse.

Women arent just writing more; they read more. According to the Pew Research Center, 78 percent of women report having read one or more books in the last year, while only 68 percent of men have.

The surge of womens writing shows no sign of slowing. Among the most anticipated books of 2020: Zora Neale Hurstons Hitting a Straight Lick With a Crooked Stick, Hilary Mantels The Mirror and the Light, Louise Erdrichs The Night Watchman and Emily St. John Mandels The Glass Hotel. And thats just between January and March. Looks like a promising decade.

Texto completo: Mr. Graham covered the Supreme Court for The New York Times during an era of intense political upheaval and racial tension before becoming CBS's law correspondent in 1972.
Fred P. Graham, a legal affairs reporter, television anchor and author who covered the Supreme Court, the Justice Department and the major trials and controversies of a tumultuous juridical era for The New York Times, CBS News and Court TV, died on Saturday at his home in Washington. He was 88.
His wife, Skila Harris, said the cause was complications of Parkinson's disease.
The son of a Tennessee preacher, Mr. Graham, a lawyer with a soft drawl, a habitual cheroot and the steady gaze of a Mississippi riverboat gambler, was a Yale, Vanderbilt and Oxford University scholar who went to Washington in 1963 as chief counsel to Senator Estes Kefauver's subcommittee on constitutional amendments, then served two years as a special assistant to Labor Secretary W. Willard Wirtz.
With his legal and Washington background, Mr. Graham began life in journalism at the top in 1965, as the first lawyer hired to be The Times's Supreme Court correspondent, a job most reporters today would consider the climax of a career. In an era of racial tension and political transition, Mr. Graham brought solid legal expertise and experience in government to the task.
Blending news, analysis and background on daily deadlines, he detailed cases arising from civil rights murders in the South, free press versus privacy issues, questions over prayer in public schools and, in 1971, the Nixon administration's losing fight to suppress publication by The Times and The Washington Post of the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department history of the government's duplicity in Vietnam.
In 1972, he joined CBS as the network's law correspondent. Over 15 years, he became a familiar face to Americans, pioneering coverage of Supreme Court rulings for the transitory attention of television viewers. While with CBS, he reported on the Watergate scandal; the resignation of former President Richard M. Nixon; and the legal struggles over abortion rights, racial preferences in college admissions and protections for criminal defendants.
Mr. Graham was also a substitute anchor for "Nightwatch" on CBS, the Sunday news show "Face the Nation" and the "CBS Morning News." As television news became more visual in the 1980s, with cameras still banned from courtrooms, Mr. Graham's on-air time dropped sharply. He was laid off in a CBS staff reduction in 1987. For two years, he was a local news anchor of WKRN-TV, the ABC affiliate in Nashville.
He then wrote "Happy Talk: Confessions of a TV Newsman," first published in 1990, on his two decades in broadcast journalism, in which he argued that network news programs had become "infotainment," the equivalent of "a well-produced video version of a tabloid." As Michael C. Janeway, then the dean of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, noted in a review for The Times Book Review, the title, "Happy Talk," referred to "that mindless banter with which television anchors fill air time."
In 1991, after a seismic change that allowed television cameras into courtrooms for live coverage of criminal trials, Mr. Graham and the legal reporter Cynthia McFadden became the first anchors of a new Courtroom Television Network, also known as Court TV. Its crime-themed programs included dramas, documentaries and live coverage of major criminal cases. It became TruTV in 2008, with a new focus on reality programs.
Interviewing experts like the defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey, Mr. Graham functioned in the courtroom the way color commentators did at sporting events, covering the 1991 acquittal of William Kennedy Smith in a Florida rape case and the 1992 acquittals of four Los Angeles police officers videotaped in the beating of Rodney King, a black man. Ensuing riots left more than 50 people dead and 2,000 injured.
"Although fans of courtroom dramas may miss the big revelations, the surprise witnesses, the tricky tactics, the climactic confessions that make such shows what they are, the real stuff has a fascination of its own, especially when principles are at stake," Walter Goodman said in a review in The Times. "Along with the legal issues, the program offers character sketches, moments of emotion and even entertaining interludes."
Mr. Graham's best-known Court TV coverage unfolded in Los Angeles in 1995 as O.J. Simpson, the former football and Hollywood star, was acquitted in the 1994 killings of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman. Besides legal analysis, Mr. Graham offered running interpretations of lawyers' body language, witnesses' facial expressions and other little dramas.
"Bailey's gripping the podium very, very tightly," Mr. Graham reported during crucial testimony by Detective Mark Fuhrman, a star prosecution witness, while at the prosecutor's table, "Marcia Clark and Chris Darden look very relaxed and happy with this witness."
Mr. Graham, who became Court TV's managing editor and retired in 2008, insisted that cameras in courtrooms did no harm. "I have covered hundreds of televised trials," he wrote in The Times in 1995, "and there was no hint that the camera adversely affected any of them."
Fred Patterson Graham was born in Little Rock, Ark., on Oct. 6, 1931, one of four children of Otis and Lois Patterson Graham. He attended schools in Texarkana, Ark., and graduated from West End High School in Nashville, where his father was a Presbyterian minister.
He received a bachelor's degree from Yale in 1953. In his three years in the Marine Corps, he served in Korea and Japan as an infantry and intelligence officer. He received a law degree from Vanderbilt University in 1959, and another from Oxford University in England in 1960. He then practiced law in Nashville for three years.
In 1961, he married Sheila Lucile McCrea. They had three children, Grier, David and Alyse Graham, and were divorced in 1982. He married Skila Harris in 1982. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his three children and eight grandchildren.
Besides his memoir, he wrote "The Self-Inflicted Wound," on Supreme Court criminal decisions under Chief Justice Earl Warren; "Press Freedom Under Pressure," on the news media and the First Amendment; and "The Alias Program," on the federal witness protection program.
Mr. Graham was a founder of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press; lectured widely; and wrote articles for The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, Harper's, Esquire and The New Republic. He won a Peabody Award for his coverage of the Watergate scandal, three Emmys and two American Bar Association Silver Gavel awards.

Texto completo: Two mothers blamed the youth football organization for the deaths of their sons, who were found to have a degenerative brain disease after a fatal motorcycle crash and suicide.
A federal court judge has dismissed a lawsuit against Pop Warner, saying the two women who sued the youth football organization failed to prove that their sons' deaths were directly linked to head trauma sustained a decade earlier as young players.
The women, Kimberly Archie and Jo Cornell, said their sons' brain trauma was caused by playing Pop Warner football and that trauma led to irrational behavior that contributed to their deaths in 2014. Archie's son, Paul Bright Jr., died at age 24 in a motorcycle accident. Cornell's son, Tyler Cornell, was 25 when he died by suicide. In 2015, both men were posthumously found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., the degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head hits.
The judge in the case, Philip S. Gutierrez, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, said that the mothers did not show sufficient links between the head trauma their sons may have suffered while playing Pop Warner football and their behavior later in life. He also said that they had discounted other contributing factors, including the football that their sons played in high school and "social and biological factors."
"Plaintiffs essentially argue that any child that plays Pop Warner football, simply by virtue of participating, without any documentation of head trauma, if found with C.T.E.-post-mortem, has a viable cause of action based on any occurrence as a result of recklessness or mood behaviors in that person's life," the judge wrote.
Ms. Archie said in an email that she intended to appeal the decision. She added that she believed her son's brain trauma and erratic behavior were caused by repeated head hits while playing youth football, not individual concussions.
"The courts missed the whole point," she said.
In a statement, Anthony Corleto, the lead attorney for Pop Warner Little Scholars, said the judge's ruling was based "on a very clear set of facts."
"While the motorcycle death of one young man and the suicide of the other are absolutely tragic, their deaths cannot be blamed on youth football," he said. "Judge Gutierrez's decision clearly illustrates the speculative nature of these claims and the absence of proof."
The case, which was set to go to trial in January before the judge's decision on Friday, was a benchmark for head trauma-related cases against sports organizations. Earlier this decade, thousands of retired N.F.L. players accused the league of knowing that repeated head hits could lead to cognitive and neurological problems but failed to warn the players.
The players' lawyers settled with the league before the case went to trial. One of their rationales for avoiding a trial was that it would have been difficult for many players to document and link head injuries they suffered in the N.F.L. to brain damage after their careers ended. In the settlement, the players do not have to prove any such link to be eligible for payouts of up to $ 5 million.
While C.T.E. has been posthumously diagnosed in hundreds of former football players, some members of the medical community continue to dispute whether there is a direct link between exposure to repeated hits to the head in games like tackle football and the development of cognitive and neurological problems later in life. Studies by scientists at Boston University and elsewhere suggest that there is a dose response -- the more hits to the head, the more likely people are to develop problems later.
But researchers have questioned studies that have shown C.T.E. in a high percentage of deceased former football players, arguing that the results were skewed because research subjects were self-selected and the families of players who suspected they had brain disease were more likely to donate the players' brains to science.

Texto completo: Las plantas de procesamiento de pollo donde hubo redadas en Mississippi el pasado agosto han recuperado una parte de fuerza laboral.
Un informe del New York Times revela que miembros de la comunidad negra en la región han tomado las plazas de trabajos en plantas como Koch Foods. El reporte indica que muchos fueron contratados en los días posteriores a las redadas en las que 680 inmigrantes hispanos fueron detenidos.
Los trabajadores negros volvieron a la industria en la que laboraron entre finales de la década de los 60 y mediados de los 80, antes de que las plantas decidieran ir por trabajadores migrantes a México para bajar costos operativos, motivados por la oportunidad de ganar más de $11 dólares por hora. Esos sueldos no se pueden ganar en tiendas minoristas o restaurantes de comida rápida, donde el pago es el mínimo del estado ($7.25).
Un gerente de un restaurante Sonic Drive-In dijo al diario neoyorquino que perdió 10 empleados a los pocos días de las redadas.
El reportaje de Richard Fausset también hace un recuento del dilema ético para los trabajadores negros ya que muchos lamentan la separación de familias hispanas y la persecución a los inmigrantes. Muchos son solidarios porque recuerdan los tiempos de la esclavitud.
Finalmente, el texto deja claro que el trabajo en las plantas de procesamiento de pollo es calificado como “duro” por los trabajadores. Esto lleva a pensar que la contratación actual podría estancarse, y las empresas podrían enfrentar a una escasez de trabajadores en el futuro.

What We Learned In Science News In 2019: Things Are Changing Fast,sometimes For The Better, Sometimes Not, And Often Indifferently.

Texto completo: It’s not easy to say that any particular development in science was the most important in a given year. But if we had to choose some highlights, we’d opt for these unforgettable events and findings.
A very bad day
in the Cretaceous
You probably know the broad outline of the story: 66 million years ago, a giant meteorite landed in what is now the Gulf of Mexico, and ended the dinosaurs. This year, various teams of scientists, working independently, helped fill in the picture of exactly what happened on that fateful day.
The biggest discovery was a site in North Dakota that preserved a jumble of fossilized fish and plant life that may have been thrown together by a tsunami on the very day of the meteorite strike. Closer to the impact site, scientists also cataloged a geological timeline of disasters that befell Earth that day. And researchers detailed evidence found in Europe that the Chicxulub event acidified the ocean in a flash, extinguishing much of Earth’s ocean life at the time.
North America’s birds
are vanishing
An exhaustive analysis of hundreds of bird species in the United States and Canada contained a warning: The majority of bird species are in decline, many by huge numbers. The likely culprits? Habitat loss and pesticides.
Milk doesn’t just come from mammals
Almond milk is over. Oat milk is canceled. What’s in? Spider milk. Burying beetle milk. Great white shark milk. Flamingo milk. Which raises the question: What exactly is milk? Not all experts agree, but some scientists say that if a substance is synthesized or highly modified by a parent, and the offspring’s life depends on it, that’s milk. Which is why we put out cookies and pink flamingo milk for Santa.
Quantum computing changed everything
and nothing
Quantum computing had a big year. Google claimed to have reached a long-sought breakthrough called “quantum supremacy,” allowing computers to perform calculations at inconceivable speeds. Some scientists are cautious about the implications of the development, but major U.S. tech companies and China are investing heavily in quantum computing. IBM, a Google competitor, described the term “quantum supremacy” as misleading and proposed another metric, “quantum volume.”
Not mind-blowing enough? An IBM quantum computer was used this year to make history go backward.
The human family tree
got a new branch
This year we met a new extinct human relative, Homo luzonensis. It was discovered in a cave on Luzon Island in the Philippines, and adds further complexity to the story of human evolution.
Your dog loves you
It really does. Clive Wynne, a psychologist specializing in dog behavior, contends that what makes your furry friend special is not its intellect but its ability to bond with you. And not just with you. The dog’s ability to bond across species - with sheep, goats, even (horrors!) cats - makes them an evolutionary success story.
Your cat likes you, too
Your cat may or may not like-like you. But it is strongly bonded to you, and in an unfamiliar situation, when it feels threatened, it is likely to turn to you for comfort.
There really is
a 5G conspiracy
At home, Russia, like the United States and other countries around the world, has embraced the promise of 5G, the next generation of cellphone technology. But in the U.S., RT America, the broadcast network run by the Russian government, has been warning American viewers that the telecommunications technology will kill and disable children. Many alarming claims about 5G technology are linked to bad, debunked science. The U.S. intelligence agencies describe RT America as “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet.” The network has taken aim at fracking, vaccination and even the U.S. electoral process; now it has applied its playbook to cellphones.
Extinction warnings for some salmon and orcas
Thirteen species of salmon and steelhead trout are considered threatened or endangered in the Northwest’s Columbia basin region. Wild Chinook salmon could disappear within the next 20 years, according to one Forest Service expert. The fish are a keystone food source for other species, and an endangered population of orcas may be starving for lack of enough wild salmon to eat. Many scientists favor removing dams on some rivers to save the orcas and the fish. But the idea faces resistance from government agencies that manage the rivers.
The fish cannon is no joke
A video of salmon traveling through a long tube went viral in 2019. You probably watched it. But the Whooshh cannon - its actual name - is a serious tool that conservationists are testing not only to help fish migrate, but to contain invasive carp that foul North American waterways. If it doesn’t work, scientists have other ideas, like koi herpes.
Deep-sea expeditions
can’t find everything
Voyages deep below the ocean uncovered many things this year: 3D images of underwater volcanoes; close-ups with giant squid; pristine shipwrecks that are centuries old. The technology for such dives is getting better and better, too. But some mysteries have yet to surface.
Robert Ballard, the ocean explorer who found the wreck of the Titanic, set his sights on solving the enigma of Amelia Earhart’s fate. Following an irresistible hint, his crew headed to the Pacific island nation of Kiribati, spending weeks searching for her crashed plane by air, land and sea. They returned empty-handed, but with one bit of solace: A blurry clue from an old picture, which had driven years of speculation about Earhart’s final resting place, can probably be dismissed for good.
The North Pole isn’t
where you think it is
The North Pole is at the very top of the world, right? Actually, the planet’s magnetic north is a considerable distance from 90 degrees north, and it moves around. Lately it has moved more than expected, requiring scientists to update the World Magnetic Model a year earlier than planned. The tinkering ensures that modern navigation tools will continue to function properly, but it is a reminder of the geoscience mysteries deep beneath Earth’s surface.
Dead brain cells
were ‘revived’
When does life end and death begin? Scientists seem to have blurred that line when they managed to restore cellular activity in brains removed from slaughtered pigs. Although the pig brains did not exhibit any higher functions, some cells regained metabolic activity. The research is preliminary, but it upends standard medical thinking about the brain and raises a few metaphysical conundrums.
Pondering the periodic table’s future
Happy 150th birthday to the Periodic Table of Elements! As scientists celebrated Dmitri Mendeleev’s enduring array of chemical elements this year, some also wondered whether there might be a better way to organize the stuff of the universe. A New and Improved Table could come in handy: As more superheavy elements are discovered, their behaviors could challenge the integrity of Mendeleev’s memorable chart.

Texto completo: "I tell young writers all the time that you can think that when a book comes out that everything's got to happen right then."
So said Jess Walter Saturday afternoon, hours after Barack Obama named the Spokane writer's 2013 collection "We Live in Water: Stories" to a list of the former president's - and cultural tastemaker's - favorite books of 2019.
"But the great thing about books is that they get spread by word of mouth," Walter added.
Word about "We Live in Water" might have been spread initially by Twitter instead of by mouth on Saturday, but it still proved Walter's maxim right, as Obama's 111 million followers found out about his high esteem for the six-year-old collection of mostly Spokane-based fiction.
Walter is no stranger to readers finding his books - his novel "Beautiful Ruins," for example, was a No. 1 New York Times bestseller - but he said Obama's pick of "We Live in Water" struck him both for the "reach" it provided and the "real honor" it represented.
"It's really flattering," Walter said. "I think people really sort of harken back to the days when the president read something other than far-right media. So it's very cool."
It's also not the first time Obama has signaled his admiration for Walter's work. Walter said a photo of Obama and his daughter holding "Beautiful Ruins" had "circulated" before.
"So this is sort of the second time my books have at least landed in their hands," he said.
Two other Washington writers, Ted Chiang for "Exhalation" and Melinda Gates for "The Moment of Lift," also made the list, as did Missoula writer Stephanie Land, who wrote "Maid." And Walter noted another Spokane writer also recently reached readers on Twitter, when Margaret Atwood praised Sharma Shields' novel "The Cassandra" on the platform.
"Spokane really does have this larger national literary reputation," Walter said. "So I think it's cool when people see Sharma or Shawn Vestal or any of us in some national light. It really speaks well for the whole community."
Walter said the news about "We Live in Water" comes just as he wraps up work on his next novel, "The Cold Millions," which is due out in the early fall.
"I don't like to talk about 'em it too much, just because it seems superstitious," Walter said. "But it's set in 1909 in Spokane. That's about all I can say about it."

Cole Porter and a songcraft so easy to love

Texto completo: Cole Porter's middle name was “Albert." Well, did you evah! “Cole" is just right: short, simple, regal (as in Old King), and close enough to “cool" without overdoing it. “Cool Porter"? As the French would say, de trop.
“Porter" is good, too: a little longer, a little less simple, and with that nifty near-assonance with the “o" in “Cole." Even the man's name almost rhymes. Porter is also a French verb — pronounced por-TAY , it means “to wear" or “carry" — an extra fillip. “I Love Paris" is one of his best-known songs. Two of his early musicals were “Paris" and “Fifty Million Frenchmen." “Les Girls" was his last film score. Porter was easily the most Gallic composer in the Great American Songbook: suave, cosmopolitan, not-infrequently risqué.
Which brings us back to Albert. It's so far from the glamour and swank and effortlessness associated with the name “Cole Porter." More to the point, it's so far from the sense of glamour and swank and effortlessness associated with his songs. Porter may or may not be first among equals as regards the Great American Songbook; but he was, without question, the most stylish of its creators.
The composer-lyricist of “Night and “Day" and “You're the Top" and “I Get a Kick Out of You" has never lost his cultural currency. But Porter has been even more visible of late. His fondness for the number 15 may be the single funniest anecdote in the 2018 documentary “Scotty and the Secret Life of Hollywood." “Harry Connick, Jr. — A Celebration of Cole Porter" finishes up a three-week run on Broadway this Sunday. In November, Yale University Press published a handsome volume of Porter's letters.
Porter's stylishness comes with a twist. This supremely urbane man was not at all urban in background. He may have loved Paris and lived there for several years after World War I, but he was born and raised in Peru, Ind. PEE-roo , as it was pronounced back then, was a long way from Pare-REE, and mileage was the least of it. In 1924, Porter wrote to a Russian lover, “I'm a simple American from the Midwest." That was a bit of a stretch, but close enough to the truth that Porter could write something as corny as “Don't Fence Me In" — though even then, he couldn't resist an internal rhyme, internal rhymes being second only to lists as a Porter trademark: “Let me straddle my old saddle underneath the Western skies."
The Porters were rich (or the Coles, his mother's family, were). He was sent East to be educated: at Worcester Academy, then Yale, and — speaking of twists — Harvard Law School. Among his housemates on Mercer Circle, off Brattle Street, was the future US secretary of state Dean Acheson. Already, Porter's affinity for glittering associates was on display. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor are as likely to turn up in the index of “The Letters of Cole Porter" as Ethel Merman or Irving Berlin. A kind of social crescendo occurs in its pages when Porter invites the socialite Elsa Maxwell to his Waldorf Towers apartment for a “snack" before the opening-night performance of his musical “Can-Can," in 1953. Among those in attendance are to be a countess, a duke, a baron, and (ho-hum) one of Porter's Cole cousins. What a swell snack it must have been.
Thankfully, Harvard Law proved a dead end, as Yale had not. Elis are still singing at least two Porter-composed fight songs: “Bulldog" and “Bingo." He first met with musical success in New Haven. So it's fitting that Yale should be the new book's publisher.
You may find yourself thinking, “How odd that it took this long to gather the letters of someone as witty and well-connected as Cole Porter." That would be because the letters tend to be duds. Porter was a diligent if mostly uninspired correspondent. There are memorable exceptions. After the 1937 riding accident whose physical consequences would shadow the rest of his life, Porter joked to his friend the actor Monty Woolley, “Morphine simply made me want to give parties." In 1953, he wrote to a musical colleague at MGM that “One day I want to give a big party and invite nothing but Censors, to find out how their minds work."
The “Letters" extend beyond correspondence from Porter to include correspondence to him, articles about him, passages from his diaries (which, alas, are as much travel summaries as anything else). The occasional oddball biographical fact will crop up. Porter was a passionate collector of Grandma Moses paintings. In Los Angeles, he annually rented a house that was a hundred yards from where O.J. Simpson would later live.
That latter fact is nowhere to be found here, which is representative of how overdone yet unhelpful the editorial apparatus is. A passing reference to Coty eau de cologne inspires a footnote describing the company's subsequent business history: “Coty was purchased by Pfizer in 1963 and by Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH in 1992." Noted. Conversely, a footnote about the nightclub owner Lou Walters leaves unmentioned that he was the father of Barbara Walters.
Maybe the most characteristic remark in all the letters comes when Porter offers birthday wishes to Berlin: “your copyrights aren't staying as young as you are." Wit, business, and friendship coincide. Again and again the letters confirm what the sheer quantity of Porter's musical output indicates: He was a demon for work. The best thing about the “Letters" is the light cast on his working procedure.
Work meant payment as well as productivity. For someone born wealthy, and who married even wealthier, Porter kept a close eye on financial matters. But it's the window on Porter as craftsman that's most interesting. He kept close at hand dictionaries in three languages, a medical dictionary, an atlas, Fowler's Modern English Usage, Roget's Thesaurus, a book called “Words, Ancient and Modern," and Andrew Loring's “The Rhymers' Lexicon." A dozen pages detailing the back-and-forth on “Can-Can" between Porter and Abe Burrows, who wrote the musical's book, is illuminating. It took a lot of effort to set the stage for that opening-night “snack."
Hard work is measured not just in effort and output but also duration. In 1915 a theatrical agent declared, “I am convinced that Mr. Porter is the one man among the many who can measure up to the standard set by the late Sir Arthur Sullivan." That's the world Porter came from. The year he died, 1964, Bob Dylan released “The Times They Are a-Changin'."
Porter wasn't good at earnestness, as Berlin was (their odd-couple friendship is the letters' nicest leitmotif). Ironists never are. He lacked the hipness of Johnny Mercer or ebullience of Frank Loesser. Ebullience is energy married to naivete; and there was nothing naïve about Cole Porter. Naïve can be a good thing, though; witness Berlin's songbook. So can sweetness, as in Ira Gershwin's lyrics. Naivete and sweetness can keep sophistication from curdling. Porter was no stranger to curdle. He'd no doubt rhyme it with “girdle."
Porter had no capacity for grandeur, as George Gershwin or Harold Arlen did. His composing an equivalent to “Summertime" or “Come Rain or Come Shine" is unthinkable, not that he'd have much cared for writing one. Richard Rodgers was an even better melodist, and Lorenz Hart an even more dazzling lyricist (though too much dazzle can be as detrimental as too little).
One of the more amusing rewards of reading the letters is feeling the temperature drop whenever Porter mentions Rodgers and Hart's stentorian successor, Oscar Hammerstein II. In a 1949 New York Times interview, he says, “The word for Dick Rodgers' melodies, I think, is holy." That's very insightful — and from Porter's cafe-society perspective also a putdown. Were Reno Sweeney ever to meet Nellie Forbush, it would lead to some disenchanted evening.
With “Oklahoma!," in 1943, Rodgers and Hammerstein transformed the Broadway musical. Porter fared well enough in that stout new world. “Kiss Me, Kate" (1948) won the first Tony for best musical. “Can-Can" and “Silk Stockings" (1955) were also hits. But they were Porter adapting to newfound conventions rather than making his own, as he had in the late '20s and throughout the '30s. Both his songs and his person helped define a looser, more knowing, less-carpentered musical world — one with Fred Astaire providing the vocals, not Alfred Drake.
Or if Astaire seems too distant in time, there's Frank Sinatra. You want more knowing and less carpentered? Listen to Sinatra, a hammer in no need of nails, singing “I've Got You Under My Skin" or “From This Moment On" or “You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To." Call it fate, or the bond of the birth certificate: Francis Albert Sinatra was born to sing the songs of Cole Albert Porter.

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Texto completo: In our last two columns you’ve read about some of the responsibilities of a director on a nonprofit’s board. You may now be thinking, “But why? I’m a volunteer!”
And so enters the lawyer to tell you why in two words: personal liability.
When is a board member liable?
While a board member is a volunteer and afforded substantial protection by law, when duties to the organization are violated (whether through acts or omissions), when certain taxes aren’t paid (notably, payroll taxes), or when a board member engages in self-dealing transactions with the organization or allows others to do so, personal liability may arise.
What are their legal duties?
A nonprofit board member, sometimes called a “trustee,” is a fiduciary — a person who must act for the benefit of another. In this case, a board member is charged with acting for the benefit of the public. It is a serious duty, and a breach of the duties can result in both personal liability and the loss of the entity’s tax exemption.
So what are those duties? In general, a board member owes the duties of care and loyalty.
The duty of care
The duty of care requires the following:
* Exercising proper business judgment based on the best interest of the organization (not its board members and certainly not yourself)
* Being properly informed on all matters voted on, and attending the meetings
* Appropriate information flow in and out (you’re obtaining all information you need to make an informed decision), and you’re not disclosing confidential information to anyone
* Following the organization’s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
A board member who violates their duty of care (for example, does not attend meetings, or ask questions about matters they don’t understand, or who, through inaction, allows a behavior detrimental to the organization to continue) can be held personally liable for any damage that occurs. There is a California case where a board, because they couldn’t agree on which investment adviser to hire, allowed a multi-million-dollar gift to sit in a non-interest checking account for two years. This caused the organization to lose significant income, and the board members were held personally liable for that. And, they were removed from the board by the Attorney General.
The duty of loyalty
This requires a board member’s faithful pursuit of the interests of the organization they serve and not the financial or other interests of the director or another person or organization. California law prohibits self-dealing transactions between board members and non-profits.
Serious fines can be imposed against the organization and board members if a transaction is entered into between the organization and an interested director, without steps taken to assure that the corporation did it for its own benefit in a fair and reasonable way that was approved in good faith by a majority of directors then in office (not just those at the meeting where the vote is taken), Did they know material facts? And, prior to approval, did the board consider and determine in good faith after reasonable investigation that they could not have obtained a better deal elsewhere?
Say, for example, the organization needs to paint its building. Director Dave is a long-term board member who happens to own a painting business. Dave offers to paint the building for $X and get it done in the next 48 hours. Board members cannot simply decide Dave is a good guy and deserves some business in return for his years of service, plus, he’s willing to do it quickly so why bother looking elsewhere.
No, the board needs to get bids from other painters and make sure that Dave’s price and quality is the best deal. Does the building need to be painted quickly or does that just to suit Dave’s schedule? Is the price fair? Is Dave properly licensed and bonded?
In other words, board members need to do the same due diligence they would for their selves. If they don’t, they could be liable for the funds lost by the organization. And abstaining from the vote won’t help you — if you don’t feel the board has done its due diligence, you will only be spared personal liability by voting “No.”
The IRS wants a word, too
Board members can also encounter unexpected tax liabilities. The IRS has its own rules against self-dealing (or what it calls “Excess Benefit Transactions”). If a “disqualified person” (someone who in the previous five years was in a position of influence over the organization, such as major donors, board members and executive staff) engages in a transaction with the organization that was to the benefit of the disqualified person, the IRS can exert a penalty against not just the disqualified person, but the entire board, for as much as 200% of the amount of the transaction. If Director Dave had been paid more than the going rate for his painting services, he and the board could face these penalties.
And finally, perhaps most shockingly, board members can be held personally liable for the unpaid payroll tax liabilities of the organization. If payroll taxes are not paid, the IRS will look to all responsible parties — the CEO, the CFO, and often board members — to recover the taxes. This is a very good reason for checks and balances for non-profit financial matters and regular audits.
Emphasis on service
It’s a privilege to serve on a non-profit board. First and foremost it’s a service to the community. To perform that service, always look out for the organization first. And. you should also be certain the organization carries Directors & Officers Liability insurance. It’s the smart thing to do.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Radio personality Don Imus, whose career was made and then undone by his acid tongue during a decades-long rise to stardom and an abrupt public plunge after a nationally broadcast racial slur, has died. He was 79.
Imus died Friday morning at Baylor Scott and White Medical Center in College Station, Texas, after being hospitalized since Christmas Eve, according to a statement issued by his family. Deirdre, his wife of 25 years, and his son Wyatt, 21, were at his side, with his son Zachary Don Cates returning from military service overseas.
He died of complications from lung disease.
Imus survived drug and alcohol woes, a raunchy appearance before President Bill Clinton and several firings during his long career behind the microphone.
But he was vilified and eventually fired after describing a women’s college basketball team as “nappy headed hos.”
His April 2007 racist and misogynist crack about the mostly black Rutgers squad, an oft-replayed 10-second snippet, crossed a line that Imus had long straddled as his irascible rants catapulted him to prominence. The remark was heard coast to coast on 60 radio stations and on a simulcast aired each morning on MSNBC.
At the time, his “Imus in the Morning” show was home to presidential hopefuls, political pundits and his favorite musicians, a must-listen in the media and political corridors of New York and Washington.
Ten years earlier, Time magazine had named him one of the 25 most influential Americans. But the remark made him an immediate pariah and he was dropped by CBS Radio and MSNBC.
Imus apologized repeatedly, calling his remark “completely inappropriate ... thoughtless and stupid,” and met with the team to hear how his comment hurt them. Although he returned to radio, and the Fox Business Network simulcast his show for a number of years, he never approached the same influence before retiring in 2018.
The incident “did change my feelings about making fun of some people who didn’t deserve to be made fun of and didn’t have a mechanism to defend themselves,” Imus told CBS News upon his retirement.
Imus’ unsparing on-air persona was tempered by his off-air philanthropy, raising more than $40 million for groups including the CJ Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. He ran a New Mexico ranch for dying children, and often used his radio show to solicit guests for donations.
Imus, born on a Riverside, California cattle ranch, was the oldest of two boys — his brother Fred later became an “Imus In the Morning” show regular.
Only at age 28 did he appear on the airwaves. His caustic persona, though it would later serve him well, was initially a problem: Imus was canned by a small station in Stockton, California, for uttering the word “hell.”
The controversy only enhanced his career, a pattern that continued throughout the decades.
Imus, moving to larger California stations, earned Billboard’s “Disc Jockey of the Year” award for medium-sized markets after a stunt where he ordered 1,200 hamburgers to go from a local McDonald’s.
He moved to Cleveland and by 1971, was doing the morning drive-time show on WNBC-AM in New York, the nation’s largest and most competitive radio market. He brought along a destructive taste for vodka.
He was a “shock jock” before the term was coined, and listeners flocked to hear what outrageous things he’d say, like phoning people to wake them up and ask, “Are ya naked?” His demons also made it an open question many mornings whether he’d show up for his 6 a.m. shift.
Imus was fired by WNBC but returned in triumph two years later adding a new vice: cocaine. While his career turned around, his first marriage, which produced daughters Nadine, Ashley, Elizabeth and Toni, fell apart.
Imus struggled with addiction until a 1987 stint at a Florida alcohol rehabilitation center, coming out just as WNBC became the fledgling all-sports station WFAN, which retained Imus’ non-sports show as its morning anchor.
His career again soared. He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame and MSNBC signed up his simulcast when the network started in 1996. He mixed comedy with A-list guests like Sens. John Kerry and John McCain. Media personalities like NBC’s Tim Russert and Frank Rich of The New York Times were regulars.
A book plug on Imus’ show guaranteed sales, and authors were soon queuing up for a slot on the show.
Imus remarried in December 1994, to the former Deirdre Coleman. They had one son, Wyatt, and adopted Zachary after he attended one of his camps for cancer-stricken children.

Texto completo: Last week I got new checks in the mail. It had been years since I needed any; like most people I find myself writing fewer and fewer checks these days. Cutting open the package, I was struck by the fact that where I used to receive a whole box of checks, I now got a slim envelope of only two — one more paper item that used to be solid and institutional was now, like so much else, swiftly passing into irrelevance. I couldn’t help feeling a twinge of loss.
When I saw the new checks I was suddenly flooded with a regret I didn’t anticipate at all. I had forgotten this new batch would have my name on it — only my name. My husband’s name, which had also been on our checks for nearly 20 years, was gone. He died in 2015. In the four years since, I gave or stored away virtually all of his stuff, but his name on the bank joint account stayed. I thought of it as a lingering bit of post-mortem paperwork that was no big deal, something I could do anytime I had five minutes to go into the bank. That I never went spoke to how much I am still connected to Alan, especially in matters of money. For all kinds of reasons, many to do with Alan himself, I never wanted to face money alone.
In the past I’d pretended there was nothing to face. Finances for me had never been a big deal, not unimportant but only one fact of life among many. When I was single and a modestly salaried journalist, I pretty much spent what I made — I reasoned that’s what money was for. As long as I could pay rent and essentials and not incur too much debt, I was content, successful even. When I got married in 2000, the idea of joining my money with my husband’s was exciting and endearing. What might we buy together? What would we save up for? The possibilities alone of expanded wealth, monetary and spiritual, made me feel rich.
Alan was much less romantic about money. I discovered he was very anxious about it, as anxious as I was determinedly indifferent. Throughout our nearly 15 years of marriage, he always wanted to call money into account, to make budgets and forecasts, to plan. I wanted to buy things in the moment and not think too much about the future. I was partly trying to counterbalance Alan’s tendency to imagine a dark fiscal future in which we were always broke and overextended, even when the facts and figures of our joint assets said otherwise.
Then roughly halfway through our marriage, in the late aughts, the journalism business began to come apart. I started losing gigs and getting paid dramatically less than the salary I had started married life with: We were no longer equally yoked. Though our love persisted, it didn’t conquer a nagging but mostly unvoiced tension about who was more valuable than who, who was a deficit and who was not.
All of this dovetailed uncomfortably with racial difference, with how we saw ourselves and our fortunes. I’m black and Alan was white. I wasn’t opposed to financial success, of course, but it was hardly a given among the black people I grew up with. More often people struggled simply to have full-time jobs or steady work at all. The real goal, whether you had money or not, was to feel affirmed and fulfilled in a country that in a million ways told black people they were worth less, if not actually worthless.
Alan had grown up seeing financial security as natural and normal, almost a birthright. Even though we both grew up working- to middle-class (though in very demographically different parts of Los Angeles) he saw that status as temporary — his generation would of course make more money than the previous one. In other words, he was deeply invested in the American dream and his place in it as a white person, while I had always stood outside of it. The irony is that Alan was a fiercely progressive history teacher who knew very well the false promise and racial hypocrisies of that dream. But he couldn’t snuff out his expectations of prosperity entirely, just as I couldn’t snuff out my corresponding sense of estrangement from money.
When I lost writing work and scrambled to make it up, Alan was alternately supportive and critical as he struggled mightily with a fear, almost a terror, of being poor. Though I was more circumspect, I couldn’t help but feel I was dragging him into a reality he had never counted on. Per the power dynamics of race, I instantly assumed responsibility for making things worse. I was disrupting our good life not just because I wasn’t making enough money now but also because my husband was obliged, by our marriage, to experience a bit of the long-term struggle so common to black people, even educated people like me.
In my joblessness I fought feeling a kind of shame very similar to the shame I felt as a grad student 30 years earlier when a white professor accused me of plagiarizing a term paper I had written because, he said, people like me simply weren’t competent enough to write like that. I knew he was wrong, yet that didn’t keep me from feeling that I would always be kept from real success — especially financial success — because of beliefs like his. On some level I accepted that.
When Alan died, the unimaginable happened: I came into money. I wasn’t rich but I was O.K., and would be O.K. for years to come. The financial planning Alan had done his whole teaching life to keep away the demons of poverty paid off — to me, not him. It was hard for me to accept his sudden, terrible death and my new struggle-free state he’d made possible. I responded with a mix of bewilderment and gratitude, and decided that I was only taking care of Alan’s money in his absence. Having his name on the checks helped me believe that and kept me from contemplating the unfamiliar truth that I was in charge of not just money, but also the life it was paying for.
That truth arrived with the new checks. But after the initial flood of regret came a surprising calm. Four years on, the truth of being financially alone is not jarring or life-changing so much as mundane. Buying a car, donating to nonprofit radio, regularly paying far too much for veterinary bills and property taxes — these are now the facts of my life, a few among many.
Alan is not among those facts anymore. His permanent absence has created a poverty I’ll always live with.

Texto completo: It's about thinking different.
Editors' Note:
An earlier version of this Bret Stephens column quoted statistics from a 2005 paper that advanced a genetic hypothesis for the basis of intelligence among Ashkenazi Jews. After publication Mr. Stephens and his editors learned that one of the paper's authors, who died in 2016, promoted racist views. Mr. Stephens was not endorsing the study or its authors' views, but it was a mistake to cite it uncritically. The effect was to leave an impression with many readers that Mr. Stephens was arguing that Jews are genetically superior. That was not his intent. He went on instead to argue that culture and history are crucial factors in Jewish achievements and that, as he put it, "At its best, the West can honor the principle of racial, religious and ethnic pluralism not as a grudging accommodation to strangers but as an affirmation of its own diverse identity. In that sense, what makes Jews special is that they aren't. They are representational." We have removed reference to the study from the column.
An eminent Lithuanian rabbi is annoyed that his yeshiva students devote their lunch breaks to playing soccer instead of discussing Torah. The students, intent on convincing their rav of the game's beauty, invite him to watch a professional match. At halftime, they ask what he thinks.
"I have solved your problem," the rabbi says.
"How?"
"Give one ball to each side, and they will have nothing to fight over."
I have this (apocryphal) anecdote from Norman Lebrecht's new book, "Genius & Anxiety," an erudite and delightful study of the intellectual achievements and nerve-wracked lives of Jewish thinkers, artists, and entrepreneurs between 1847 and 1947. Sarah Bernhardt and Franz Kafka; Albert Einstein and Rosalind Franklin; Benjamin Disraeli and (sigh) Karl Marx -- how is it that a people who never amounted even to one-third of 1 percent of the world's population contributed so seminally to so many of its most pathbreaking ideas and innovations?
The common answer is that Jews are, or tend to be, smart. But the "Jews are smart" explanation obscures more than it illuminates. Aside from perennial nature-or-nurture questions, there is the more difficult question of why that intelligence was so often matched by such bracing originality and high-minded purpose. One can apply a prodigious intellect in the service of prosaic things -- formulating a war plan, for instance, or constructing a ship. One can also apply brilliance in the service of a mistake or a crime, like managing a planned economy or robbing a bank.
But as the story of the Lithuanian rabbi suggests, Jewish genius operates differently. It is prone to question the premise and rethink the concept; to ask why (or why not?) as often as how; to see the absurd in the mundane and the sublime in the absurd. Where Jews' advantage more often lies is in thinking different.
Where do these habits of mind come from?
There is a religious tradition that, unlike some others, asks the believer not only to observe and obey but also to discuss and disagree. There is the never-quite-comfortable status of Jews in places where they are the minority -- intimately familiar with the customs of the country while maintaining a critical distance from them. There is a moral belief, "incarnate in the Jewish people" according to Einstein, that "the life of the individual only has value [insofar] as it aids in making the life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful."
And there is the understanding, born of repeated exile, that everything that seems solid and valuable is ultimately perishable, while everything that is intangible -- knowledge most of all -- is potentially everlasting.
"We had been well off, but that was all we got out," the late financier Felix Rohatyn recalled of his narrow escape, with a few hidden gold coins, from the Nazis as a child in World War II. "Ever since, I've had the feeling that the only permanent wealth is what you carry around in your head." If the greatest Jewish minds seem to have no walls, it may be because, for Jews, the walls have so often come tumbling down.
These explanations for Jewish brilliance aren't necessarily definitive. Nor are they exclusive to the Jews.
At its best, the American university can still be a place of relentless intellectual challenge rather than ideological conformity and social groupthink. At its best, the United States can still be the country that respects, and sometimes rewards, all manner of heresies that outrage polite society and contradict established belief. At its best, the West can honor the principle of racial, religious and ethnic pluralism not as a grudging accommodation to strangers but as an affirmation of its own diverse identity. In that sense, what makes Jews special is that they aren't. They are representational.
The West, however, is not at its best. It's no surprise that Jew hatred has made a comeback, albeit under new guises. Anti-Zionism has taken the place of anti-Semitism as a political program directed against Jews. Globalists have taken the place of rootless cosmopolitans as the shadowy agents of economic iniquity. Jews have been murdered by white nationalists and black "Hebrews." Hate crimes against Orthodox Jews have become an almost daily fact of life in New York City.
Jews of the late 19th century would have been familiar with the hatreds. Jews of the early 21st century should recognize where they could lead. What's not secret about Jewish genius is that it's a terribly fragile flower.

Texto completo: Corrections that appeared in print on Saturday, Dec. 28, 2019.
FRONT PAGE
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a hunger strike in Nicaragua included an erroneous byline. It was written by Frances Robles, not by Ms. Robles and Cesar Rodriguez. (Mr. Rodriguez was the photographer for the article.)
INTERNATIONAL
An article on Thursday about Pope Francis's Christmas speech incorrectly rendered a quotation by the pope. He spoke of injustice that forces people to "endure unspeakable forms of abuse, enslavement of every kind and torture in inhumane detention camps," not to "ensure" them.
ARTS & LEISURE
Because of an editing error, the Surfacing article on Page 32, about photographs of clouds, includes an erroneous byline. The text is by Josephine Sedgwick.
BOOK REVIEW
Because of an editing error, a review on Page 22 about the Y.A. novel "Jackpot," by Nic Stone, refers incorrectly to the author. She is a woman.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Tuesday about the journalist Karl E. Meyer misstated who at The New York Times decided not to report in early 1961 that the Bay of Pigs invasion was imminent and that it was being financed and directed by the Central Intelligence Agency. It was the publisher, not the reporter Tad Szulc's editors. The obituary also misstated the given name of Mr. Meyer's paternal grandfather and part of his mother's name. His grandfather was Georg Meyer, not George, and his mother was Dorothy (Narefsky) Meyer, not Narevsky.
An obituary on Nov. 28 about the director Jonathan Miller referred imprecisely to Jeremy Hillary Boob, a character in the animated Beatles film "Yellow Submarine." Although the character may have been based in part on Mr. Miller, it is generally accepted that he is based primarily on the historian Jeremy Adams.
An obituary on Friday about the college football coach Hayden Fry misstated the name of one of the universities at which he coached. It was North Texas State University, not North Texas University.

Texto completo: The grisly footage shows fighters aligned with the Islamic State cutting the throats of 10 prisoners and shooting an 11th captive.
DAKAR, Senegal -- An affiliate of the Islamic State in Nigeria has claimed responsibility for the execution of 11 people, saying the killings were in retaliation for the death of the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Syria in October.
A video released on Thursday showed members of the Nigerian affiliate slashing the throats of 10 people and shooting an additional person. A voice-over says the killings are a "message for Christians" and that all of those killed were Christian, although Nigerian experts said some of them were probably Muslims, based on previous episodes involving the group.
The Islamic State, or ISIS, has lost all of the territory it once held in Iraq and Syria, but it remains a threat even after Mr. al-Baghdadi was killed in an American raid on his hide-out in northwestern Syria. In addition to the affiliate in Nigeria, which is known as the Islamic State West Africa Province, groups in the Philippines, Afghanistan, Sinai and the Sahel, a 3,000-mile stretch of land south of the Sahara, also claim allegiance to ISIS.
The members of the Islamic State West Africa Province, which is known by the acronym ISWAP, left the Islamic militant group Boko Haram in 2016. According to the International Crisis Group, it has between 3,500 and 5,000 fighters. Its leaders split from Boko Haram in part because they disapproved of the violence that the group and its harsh leader, Abubakar Shekau, has meted out to Muslims, according to analysts.
The executions could herald a possible return to the harsher methods of Boko Haram, according to experts.
Abdulbasit Kassim, a co-author of "The Boko Haram Reader: From Nigerian Preachers to the Islamic State," said that other Islamic State provinces had released videos of revenge for the killing of Mr. al-Baghdadi. Mr. Kassim said there was a strong possibility that ISWAP was under pressure to do the same.
"I think there's a demand from IS Central: 'ISWAP, where is your submission for revenge for Baghdadi?"' said Mr. Kassim, referring to the main body of the Islamic State. He added that he believed ISWAP was making two types of propaganda, one aimed at obtaining ransoms from the Nigerian government, and one to satisfy Islamic State demands.
The video was released to Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who often publishes information about both ISWAP and Boko Haram. According to Mr. Salkida, ISWAP had shown interest in negotiating a prisoner swap, but abruptly changed course and executed the prisoners instead.
The 56-second video shows the captives, who were blindfolded and wearing orange tunics, kneeling on the ground, their captors standing behind them in black balaclavas.
A fighter in the middle lifts a handgun and shoots the prisoner in front of him in the head. The video then cuts to the fighters standing behind the other 10 prisoners. Holding each captive by the face or hair, the fighters slit their throats.
In the version of the video seen by The New York Times, which was published on Amaq, an ISIS propaganda arm, a man speaks over the recording.
"This message is to the Christians in the world," he says in both Arabic and Hausa, a Nigerian language, according to the Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadists and white supremacists. "Those who you see in front of us are Christians, and we will shed their blood as revenge for the two dignified sheikhs, the caliph of the Muslims, and the spokesman for the Islamic State, Sheikh Abu al-Hassan al-Muhajir, may Allah accept them."
A day after the death of Mr. Baghdadi, considered the caliph by his followers, the man thought likely to be his successor, Mr. al-Muhajir, the group's spokesman, was killed in a separate raid.
Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he thought that "I.S. is trying to grab headlines during the holidays when usually there isn't much news."
The State Department condemned the attacks. "We are appalled by the vicious ISIS-West Africa attack targeting Christians in Nigeria," Tibor Nagy, the State Department's top Africa policy official, said in a Twitter message.
President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria said in a statement, "These barbaric killers don't represent Islam and millions of other law-abiding Muslims around the world."
There has been an upsurge in violence in northeast Nigeria over the past year, and particularly in the last six months, contributing to a deteriorating humanitarian situation there, with armed groups setting up checkpoints to target and abduct civilians, the United Nation's humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria, Antonio Canhandula, said this week.
In Burkina Faso, another West African country plagued by groups of armed militants, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Tuesday that killed seven soldiers that it said ISWAP fighters had carried out.
Tens of thousands of civilians, the majority of them Muslim, have been killed by both Islamist militants and Nigerian security forces in three northeastern states of Nigeria since 2009.

Texto completo: She was 14 when she was cast in the title role of Stanley Kubrick's 1962 film of the Nabokov novel. It remained her best-known credit.
Sue Lyon, who at 14 was cast in the title role of Stanley Kubrick's "Lolita," a film version of Vladimir Nabokov's eyebrow-raising novel about a middle-aged man who becomes obsessed with a 12-year-old girl, died on Thursday in Los Angeles. She was 73.
Phil Syracopoulos, a longtime friend, announced her death. He said she had been in declining health for some time.
Ms. Lyon accumulated more than two dozen film and television credits from 1959 to 1980, but she was known primarily for one: Mr. Kubrick's 1962 film of the Nabokov novel, which was adapted for the screen by Mr. Nabokov himself. Some 800 girls were said to have sought the part. When Ms. Lyon was cast, Mr. Nabokov, employing the word he used in the novel, called her "the perfect nymphet," although he later said that the French actress Catherine Demongeot might have been better.
The film was memorably promoted with a photograph taken by Bert Stern in Sag Harbor, N.Y., showing Ms. Lyon in heart-shaped sunglasses sucking on a red lollipop, "despite the fact that neither the sunglasses nor the lollipop appear in the film itself," as The New York Times noted years later. The trailer worked the tagline, "How did they ever make a movie of 'Lolita'?"
The novel was scandalous when it was first published in English in 1955; the film, made when the restrictive Motion Picture Production Code still governed Hollywood, was less so -- in part, some critics thought, because Ms. Lyon, whose character was aged slightly for the movie, seemed too mature.
"She looks to be a good 17 years old, possessed of a striking figure and a devilishly haughty teenage air," Bosley Crowther said in his review in The Times. "The distinction is fine, we will grant you, but she is definitely not a 'nymphet."'
Mr. Kubrick, in an interview for the 1970 book "The Film Director as Superstar," by Joseph Gelmis, acknowledged that he wasn't able to capture the forbidden flavor of the novel adequately.
"Because of all the pressure over the Production Code and the Catholic Legion of Decency at the time, I believe I didn't sufficiently dramatize the erotic aspect of Humbert's relationship with Lolita," he said, referring to the character Humbert Humbert, played by James Mason. Opinions of the movie, though, have improved over time.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Lyon was born on July 10, 1946, in Davenport, Iowa, the youngest of five children. Her father died before her first birthday; soon after, her mother, Sue Karr Lyon, took the family to Dallas. Three years later they moved to Los Angeles.
Ms. Lyon landed a few small television roles, including one in 1959 on "The Loretta Young Show," where Mr. Kubrick first noticed her.
After "Lolita," she appeared in "The Night of the Iguana" (1964), "Tony Rome" (1967), "Evel Knievel" (1971) and other movies, as well as an assortment of TV shows. Her most recent credit was in "Alligator," a 1980 horror movie.
Ms. Lyon had brief marriages to Hampton Fancher, Roland Harrison, Cotton Adamson and Edward Weathers. Her marriage to Richard Rudman in 1985 ended in divorce in 2002.
Her marriage to Mr. Adamson in 1973 made news: At the time, he was incarcerated for second-degree murder and robbery. The wedding took place in a conference room at the Colorado State Penitentiary. A year later, when she announced that they were divorcing, she cited the effect the marriage had had on her career.
"I've been told by people in the movie business, specifically producers and film distributors, that I won't get a job because I'm married to Cotton," she said.
Ms. Lyon's survivors include a daughter, Nona, from her marriage to Mr. Harrison.

Texto completo: The holidays will be winding down. The year will be drawing to a close. And just about everyone will be closing the books on the last 12 months while looking ahead – some with anticipation, others with apprehension – to the approaching year. Like no other day on the calendar, Dec. 31 encompasses so much for so many each year – a day for reflection, a day for making plans, a day to relax or a day to grow anxious over all the things you failed to accomplish over the preceding months. Regardless of your New Year's Eve plans – a quiet evening at home, a rowdy night out on the town – the final hours of 2019 offer all a waiver on anxiety. Instead, the moment arrives to unwind and have fun. You can let go of your worries – be they about 2019 or 2020 – and try to focus on the moment at which the clock strikes midnight.
We will all share a collective cheer, a collective sigh of relief that we made it through one more year, a collective moment of humanity defined by a 10-second countdown. At 12:01 a.m. on Jan. 1, 2020, we can all go back to being ourselves, and the misery or joy that might bring.
For now, let's have some fun. So if you're looking to throw down on Dec. 31, there are plenty of options – from the Ed Palermo Big Band at the Falcon in Marlboro to Tramps Like Us, a Bruce Springsteen tribute band at Daryl's House in Pawling.
And why not start the festivities a little early this coming weekend? Or extend it all a few days into the weekend that follows New Year's Day? For those who are feeling ambitious, there is plenty going on when it comes to live music around the Hudson Valley over the coming week or so.
As for New Year's Eve, stepping out on the town sounds just fine to Jean Dalleo of Marlboro.
"Now that my kids are grown and adults I want to go out and have fun," said Dalleo, 52.
Asked what she likes about the holiday, Dalleo said, "It's just one more year down, another year ahead coming. It's just fun to celebrate something brand new again."
So Happy New Year, one and all. For those who would like to ring in the New Year with some live music or comedy, we've got plenty of suggestions:

New Year's Eve
in Times Square
Regarding the annual New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square, did you know:
The Ball is:
a geodesic sphere, 12 feet in diameter, and weighs 11,875 pounds.
covered with a total of 2,688 Waterford Crystal triangles that vary in size, and range in length from 43/4 inches to 53/4 inches per side.
capable of displaying a palette of more than 16 million vibrant colors and billions of patterns that creates a spectacular kaleidoscope effect atop One Times Square.
The first-ever celebration of New Year's Eve in Times Square was held in 1904 and it commemorated the official opening of the new headquarters of The New York Times.
An all-day street festival culminated in a fireworks display, but two years later, New York City banned the fireworks. So Adolph Ochs, owner of The New York Times, arranged for a large, illuminated, seven-hundred-pound iron and wood ball to be lowered from the Times tower flagpole, precisely at midnight, to mark the beginning of the new year.

Texto completo: Joe Biden ha asegurado este viernes que no declarará en el ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra el presidente Donald Trump, si es llamado para ello.
“No lo haré porque está todo diseñado como Trump lo ha hecho durante toda su vida: intentando desviar la atención sobre él mismo. El asunto que se trata no es lo que hice yo”, ha asegurado Biden, en unas declaraciones recogidas por el diario The New York Times.
El exvicepresidente ha asegurado que es todo una “distracción”, a lo que ha añadido que los motivos por lo que sería llamado a declarar en el ‘impeachment’ contra Trump serían “absolutamente engañosos”
Por ello, ha reiterado que los republicanos quieren su testimonio para “desviar la atención” sobre las acciones que ha realizado Trump al frente de la Casa Blanca.
Las declaraciones de Biden tienen lugar después de que la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos aprobara abrir un ‘impeachment’ en el Senado contra Trump, quien se convertirá así en el tercer mandatario del país en hacer frente a un juicio político.
Con 230 votos demócratas a favor, 197 en contra (195 republicanos y dos demócratas) y una única abstención, la de la congresista demócrata Tulsi Gabbard, los cargos presentados en contra de Trump por abuso de poder y obstrucción a la justicia salieron adelante.
La Comisión Judicial acusó a Trump de un cargo de abuso de poder por presionar a su homólogo ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, para que abriera dos investigaciones que le beneficiarían para la reelección en 2020: una sobre las supuestas corruptelas del precandidato demócrata Joe Biden y su hijo Hunter en sus negocios en Ucrania y otra sobre “la desacreditada teoría” de que fue ese país, no Rusia, el que interfirió en los comicios de 2016.
Trump también está acusado de un segundo cargo de obstrucción al Congreso por rechazar los requerimientos que le ha hecho la Cámara de Representantes tanto de información como de comparecencia en el marco de la investigación del ‘impeachment’.
Por su parte, la Casa Blanca afirmó que esta decisión fue “uno de los episodios más lamentables de la historia estadounidense”. “Sin recibir un solo voto republicano y sin probar que se incurriese en ningún tipo de delito, los demócratas han sacado adelante unos cargos ilegítimos contra el presidente en la Cámara de Representantes”, señalaron.

Fair Senate Trial Roberts’ Job, Not McConnell’s

Texto completo: A vigorous debate has broken out among senators and House leaders about how President Trump’s impeachment trial ought to be conducted.
Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-New York, sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, outlining the procedures he believes the Senate should employ, asserting that subpoenas should be issued to four senior administration officials whom Trump prohibited from testifying in the House’s impeachment inquiry (notably, former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney).
McConnell replied on the Senate floor that Schumer “misunderstand[s] constitutional roles” and flatly rejected his proposals. Then, in an opinion article in The New York Times, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., accused McConnell of laying the groundwork for “a Senate coverup.” Now, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says she may hold off on sending the articles of impeachment until she’s confident the Senate will hold a fair trial.
This debate is remarkable because McConnell is unlikely to be making the key decisions about the shape of a Senate trial. The contours will be set by rules dating to the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson, in 1868. Those rules leave answers to the chief justice of the United States, John G. Roberts Jr., who, as set forward in the Constitution, presides over the proceedings. Schumer and McConnell are bit players.
To be sure, senators can pass a special resolution setting rules for Trump’s trial, as they did for President Bill Clinton’s; such a resolution is the subject of last week’s skirmishing. But doing so would require more comity than is evident, as it needs a supermajority of 60 votes and there are just 53 Republican senators. Absent a special resolution, senators must defer to Roberts - or overrule him, if they dare.
McConnell could propose a partisan resolution, but Democrats could filibuster. McConnell could try to do away with the filibuster, but that would require the support of almost his entire caucus, including vulnerable senators who represent states that increasingly are voting Democratic - Susan Collins of Maine, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Martha McSally of Arizona. It probably would doom the filibuster for ordinary legislation, which McConnell wants to keep.
Assuming there’s no special resolution, once the House presents articles of impeachment to the Senate, the Senate’s standing rules make the chief justice responsible for trial preparations and the trial itself; all motions would be directed to him. The motions could come from the representatives the House appoints to manage its impeachment case or from the president’s defense lawyers.
To make clear their disdain for the entire process, the president’s lawyers could move for dismissal of the articles before the managers for the House even begin presenting evidence. Early motions to dismiss are allowed in criminal trials where the indictment or information fails to allege an actual crime. But unless Roberts believes the conduct described in the articles of impeachment would not constitute lawful grounds for removal of a president even if proven, he probably would deny such a motion. The chief justice would not be prepared to say that no president could ever be impeached and removed for such acts.
The House’s impeachment managers, in turn, could move for the issuance of subpoenas to the current and former administration officials who refused to testify in the House on the president’s orders. Again, it’s difficult to see what basis Roberts would have for refusing to issue such subpoenas. The power to compel unwilling witnesses’ testimony is fundamental to the prosecutorial function, which the House assumes in an impeachment proceeding.
On either motion the chief justice could, it is true, decline to rule and put the question to the full Senate. But declining to rule on such simple questions in favor of McConnell, who has declared his intent to shield the president, widely would be perceived as a hyperpartisan move and would call into question the integrity of all his decisions. Given Roberts’ repeated efforts to preserve the public’s esteem for the Supreme Court as a body above politics, he seems unlikely to take such a step.
Once Roberts ruled on a given matter, any senator could seek a vote of the Senate to overrule him. This would require only a simple majority. Republicans have such a majority so long as they lose no more than two of their senators. However, voting to overrule Roberts, a staunch conservative appointed by a Republican president and confirmed by a Republican Senate, to short-circuit a full airing of the charges against the president might well make some senators uncomfortable. Between those senators who have announced their retirement - Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, and Pat Roberts of Kansas - and those facing difficult reelection battles, McConnell probably could not count on limiting defections to two.
Once the House rests its case, Trump’s lawyers would have to decide whether to mount a defense or to move for dismissal. Granting a motion to dismiss at the conclusion of the House’s presentation of the evidence would be the equivalent of the Senate voting to decide the case in Trump’s favor, and the chief justice probably would allow it to go to the full Senate. Unless more than two Republican senators wanted to prolong the proceedings, the case presumably would end there.
Democrats who complain that McConnell has not committed in advance to acceptable trial procedures fundamentally misconstrue his limited authority. And Pelosi’s withholding of the articles is a bit like the electric company threatening not to send you a bill until you get rid of your television. As McConnell has pointed out, the House gains no leverage by “refraining from sending us something we do not want.” He would welcome the chance to avoid making vulnerable Republicans choose between alienating Trump’s supporters and offending moderates troubled by the president’s actions. The threat of not triggering such a trial, which makes the process look even more tactically political, is more likely to make him dance a jig than to offer concessions.
McConnell has no reason to agree to special rules. But standing rules probably would provide for a reasonable airing of the charges against the president. They would force senators to vote in response to a full, public record. McConnell will no doubt be a determined and effective advocate for the president, but he simply lacks the power to turn the proceedings into the farce Democrats fear.

As North Korea and China show, Trump is a terrible negotiator

Texto completo: I'm starting to wonder if Donald Trump, bestselling author of "The Art of the Deal," just isn't very good at making deals. His presidency has been a ceaseless torrent of promises about what he'll achieve from negotiations with foreign leaders. But time and again, he ends up high and dry.
Right now, the administration is waiting to find out what the North Korean regime meant when it made the ominous vow to give the United States a "Christmas gift" if talks didn't produce an agreement on nuclear weapons and economic sanctions by year's end. No such accord has been reached, which confirms the bankruptcy of Trump's strategy.
He started out in 2017 by threatening Kim Jong Un with "fire and fury" if he made threats. But then the two agreed to a 2018 meeting in Singapore -- a made-for-TV spectacle that produced an agreement short on meaningful specifics. About all Trump got in return for giving Kim the propaganda opportunity was a halt in missile tests and the purported demolition of a test site.
At a second meeting in Vietnam in February, Trump walked out after failing to get what he wanted. That ploy didn't work. Since then, Kim has carried out several short-range rocket and missile tests. Trump's response? "He likes testing missiles," the president said last summer with peculiar nonchalance.
All indications are that he's been duped by a wily opponent who is playing for time. Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, recently told NPR the North Koreans will never surrender their nuclear weapons.
"They're happy to sell that same bridge over and over again, but there's no serious chance they will ever voluntarily give it up," he said. "The more time they have, the more they can overcome all the technological and scientific difficulties to perfecting a deliverable nuclear weapons capability."
The China trade deal that Trump celebrated is underwhelming, leaving most of the important issues unresolved. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer had to admit it was just "a first step" -- a far cry from the "epic" agreement Trump said was almost complete back in April.
Despite hitting China with an array of tariffs that hurt American consumers and companies, Trump has yet to get anything worth the cost he's inflicted on the U.S. economy.
As for the view from Beijing, The New York Times reported Dec. 14, "People close to China's economic policy making process say that as the trade talks progressed this past week, the mood among Chinese officials gradually shifted from deeply worried to cautious and finally, by late in the week, jubilant and even incredulous that the hard-liners' goals had been achieved."
When the Chinese refused to sign a deal unless the U.S. agreed to roll back tariffs, the administration said no -- only to cave in the end. Lighthizer says Beijing agreed to buy at least $40 billion in American farm products each year, but the Chinese themselves have made no such commitment publicly.
It just may be the administration is greatly exaggerating what it got. That's what it did with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a modest update of NAFTA that Trump pretended was a radical overhaul.
His negotiating wizardry has also fizzled against Iran. He abandoned the agreement the Obama administration reached to block Tehran's path to the bomb, calling it "a horrible, one-sided deal." But Trump's attempt to use economic strangulation to force the other side to submit has failed.
In response, Iran has taken steps that are forbidden by the agreement. So thanks to Trump, the Iranians are closer today to getting a nuclear weapon than they would be had he stayed in the deal.
Meanwhile, attacks carried out by Tehran in response to U.S. pressure have forced the administration to contemplate sending 14,000 troops to the region. Instead of making the Iranians more compliant, he has made them more aggressive.
Let's not forget the most conspicuous negotiating flop of all. Trump vowed over and over that we would build a wall on the southwest border and Mexico would pay for it. But Mexico has not paid anything and obviously never will.
The president brings to mind Samuel Johnson's comment: "Men who cannot deceive others are often very successful at deceiving themselves." Maybe Trump blustered his way into a few good deals during his time in private business. But when it comes to high-stakes negotiations with foreign adversaries, he's a lamb among wolves.

Texto completo: Linsanity, LeBron James's reunion with Cleveland and "The Block" are some of the many extraordinary memories basketball fans took from the past 10 years.
The New York Times is reflecting on the past decade in the N.B.A., which has evolved perhaps more than any other major sports league.
The last decade in the N.B.A. had something for everyone. New superstars emerged -- Stephen Curry, Kawhi Leonard -- and veterans like Ray Allen and Kobe Bryant reminded us all why they were so great. There were heartbreaks (the Spurs) and comebacks (the Cavaliers) and moments fans and players will never forget ("The Block").
Our writers and editors explained which seasons from the past 10 years were their favorites.
2011-12: A Lockout, Then Linsanity
Senior staff editor and reporter
For incident and excitement, 2011-12. The season started grimly, with a lockout, eventually costing 16 games of the regular season. But the revised 66-game schedule felt fresh and fast, and every game had a little more import. Chris Paul seemed to be headed for the Lakers, only to have the deal vetoed by then-Commissioner David Stern, and he wound up going to the Clippers instead. In February, Jeremy Lin turned into Oscar Robertson for the magical run of Linsanity. In the playoffs, the eighth-seeded 76ers beat the top-seeded Bulls after Chicago's Derrick Rose injured a knee, and the LeBron James-Dwyane Wade-Chris Bosh Heat won their first title.
2012-13: Ray Allen Happened
Sports business reporter
The N.B.A. is at its best when there is a clear top dog but also a number of fun, interesting and credible challengers, and that was never more apparent than in 2012-13.
The Heat had just won a championship with James and were demolishing everything in their path. But the Spurs almost took them down in the finals -- and would have, if not for an incredible shot by Allen.
There were so many other fun teams. A plodding, defensive style was still viable, so the Roy Hibbert-led Pacers were designed specifically to stop James, and Tony Allen led the Grit n' Grind Grizzlies to the Western Conference finals. The post-James Harden Thunder looked unstoppable, until Russell Westbrook needed knee surgery.
It was also a preview of the rest of the decade. The fun-running Warriors upset the Nuggets in the playoffs, and Harden's Rockets and Carmelo Anthony's Knicks found success in bombing 3-pointers for fun.
2013-14 and 2018-19: Kawhi Leonard Proved His Value
Hall of Fame sportswriter
A draw: 2013-14 and 2018-19 with Leonard winding up as the most valuable player of both finals. How Leonard and the San Antonio Spurs recovered from the excruciating 2012-13 seven-game finals defeat at the hands of James and the Heat -- by crushing Miami in a rematch -- was a historically epic bounce-back. And the one-season rental conditions under which Leonard and the 2018-19 Toronto Raptors brought the Larry O'Brien trophy across a United States border for the first time, Golden State's injuries notwithstanding, were nothing short of remarkable.
2014-15: LeBron Returned, and the Warriors Warmed Up
Senior staff editor
No season in the decade started as wide open as 2014-15. The Spurs were a force to be reckoned with, but the rest of the league was in question. How would James's return work in Cleveland? Could the Clippers or Warriors take the leap from fun team to contender? Just how good were the Grizzlies or the Bulls?
The story for much of the year was the shocking improvement of the Atlanta Hawks, who jumped from 38 wins to 60 under Coach Mike Budenholzer and sent four players to the All-Star Game. But Golden State's reinvention under Coach Steve Kerr proved to have more staying power.
Those Warriors teams are thought of as an unforgiving juggernaut, but that feeling didn't develop until the second season under Kerr. In 2015, it was still a bunch of people wondering if the whole thing would work. It did.
2015-16: Golden State Got Hot ... Then Flamed Out
Hall of Fame sports reporter
Nothing tops the 2015-16 season from start to finish. I had a front-row seat for a good chunk of Golden State's insane 24-0 launch to the regular season -- all, remember, without the ailing Kerr -- and I remain convinced that no team will ever match it. The Cavaliers' comeback from 3-1 down in the finals, against a Warriors team that had won a record 73 games, was equally historic given the five decades that the city of Cleveland had waited for a major championship. Throw in the 60 points that Kobe Bryant scored in his final N.B.A. game and there is no debate in this category.
N.B.A. editor
It would have been more difficult for a '90s kid like me to accept the death of the Bulls' wins record had it not been so much fun to see the Warriors take it down. Their dominance in the 2015-16 regular season was boring to some, and I get it. Each night you wondered whether they'd win by 30 points or 40, or if Curry would even need to play the second half. But I love that kind of excellence; it's why it's so much fun to watch the Lakers combo of James and Anthony Davis now.
Sports reporter
The 2015-16 season had everything: intrigue, entertainment, surprises. Who can forget how the Warriors turned the regular season into performance art? They won their first 24 games by dismantling their opponents and went on to finish 73-9, a record-setting run that most figured would extend into the playoffs.
Golden State even had a 3-1 lead against the Cavaliers in the N.B.A. finals. But Draymond Green got suspended for Game 5, James engineered his usual heroics and Kyrie Irving drained a 3-pointer for the ages in Game 7 to clinch the Cavaliers' first championship.
"The game always gives back to people that are true to the game," James said afterward. "I've watched it. I know the history of the game, and I was just calm. I was calm."

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'A SOLDIER'S PLAY' at the American Airlines Theater (previews start on Dec. 27; opens on Jan. 21). Charles Fuller's 1981 play, about a murder at a Louisiana army base, makes its Broadway debut. Kenny Leon's production stars David Alan Grier, Blair Underwood and Jerry O'Connell. "What Mr. Fuller has written," Frank Rich wrote in a review of the original production, "is a relentless investigation into the complex, sometimes cryptic pathology of hate."

Last Chance
'DERREN BROWN: SECRET' at the Cort Theater (closes on Jan. 4). New Yorkers' secrets will be a bit safer now that this evening by Derren Brown, the English magician and mentalist, ends its Broadway run. "Every time I visit the dapper Mr. Brown," Ben Brantley wrote, "I leave in a lighter, less-polluted mood -- brainwashed in the most positive sense of the term."
212-239-6200, derrenbrownsecret.com
'A CHRISTMAS CAROL' at the Lyceum Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Jack Thorne's often delicious adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic, directed by Matthew Warchus, will be packing up its chocolate chip cookies and oranges. "While retaining the jolliness and sentimentality associated with some 170 years' worth of stage versions," Ben Brantley wrote, "Thorne and Warchus have polished the story's social conscience to a restored brightness."
212-239-6200, achristmascarolbroadway.com
'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF' at Stage 42 (closes on Jan. 5). Sunrise, sunset, swiftly flows the season. The National Yiddish Theater Folksbiene's Yiddish language adaptation of Joseph Stein, Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick's musical, directed by Joel Grey, ends its Off Broadway run. Jesse Green wrote of Shraga Friedman's Yiddish translation, "It couldn't sound more right as spoken by these characters -- or as sung."
212-239-6200, fiddlernyc.com
'42 FT: A MENAGERIE OF MECHANICAL MARVELS' at the New Victory Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Cirque Mechanics' new show lays down its pulleys and levers. The steampunk-like gadgets in this friendly spectacle, directed by Aloysia Gavre and Chris Lashua, aren't all that marvelous. But the performers, like the strongman Battulga Battogtokh and the slack wire walker Esther De Monteflores, are.
646-223-3010, newvictory.org
'HALFWAY BITCHES GO STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN' at the Atlantic Theater Company at the Linda Gross Theater (closes on Jan. 5). The inhabitants of this halfway house for homeless and abused women are moving on. Ben Brantley wrote that in this noisy, capacious drama, the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis "enfolds every one of his characters in a blanket of compassion that wisely never extends to the promise of happy endings."
866-811-4111, atlantictheater.org
'THE LIGHTNING THIEF: THE PERCY JACKSON MUSICAL' at the Longacre Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Even a demigod can't stay on Broadway forever. Joe Tracz and Rob Rokicki's adaptation of the popular middle-school novels, directed by Stephen Brackett, steps down from Olympus. Jesse Green described it as "both overblown and underproduced, filled with sentiments it can't support and effects it can't pull off."
212-239-6200, lightningthiefmusical.com
'OUR DEAR DEAD DRUG LORD' at the McGinn/Cazale Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Alexis Scheer's Off Broadway play, directed by Whitney White and set among ghost-obsessed Miami schoolgirls, puts away its Ouija board. As Ben Brantley wrote in an admiring review, "A play that started off as a hoot -- a friendly, familiar satire on high school mores and lingo -- winds up as a primal scream."
212-787-8302, wptheater.org
'SLAVA'S SNOW SHOW' at the Stephen Sondheim Theater (closes on Jan. 5). This show's beloved clowns will entertain audiences through the holidays, then take their blizzard elsewhere. Laura Collins-Hughes wrote that the show left her feeling as if she had just had a massage, "though a massage doesn't, generally speaking, blast paper-confetti snow down your top that you'll have to scoop out later."
212-239-6200, slavaonbroadway.com
'TOOTSIE' at the Marquis Theater (closes on Jan. 5). David Yazbek and Robert Horn's adaptation of the beloved comedy of cross-dressing, which won a Tony for its leading man, Santino Fontana, takes off its dress. "Musical comedy only soars when it's fully grounded," Jesse Green wrote, "and 'Tootsie,' however unbelievable, has its feet on the ground -- in a modest Size 13 heel."
tootsiemusical.com
'WAITRESS' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater (closes on Jan. 5). Sugar, butter and flour turned out to be key ingredients for a long Broadway run. The Times described this 2016 Sara Bareilles musical, directed by Diane Paulus, as an "agreeable if unexceptional musical." As it serves its last slices of pie, Katharine McPhee ("Smash") wears the frilly apron.

Texto completo: "I love playing the game of football, but not the other stuff that goes with it," said Isaiah Woods, now considering a career in design. "I stress myself out way too much."
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our November 2018 report on a college football player's battle with depression .
His smile was back, but now it had a 14-karat flash.
As he sat across from me at a Los Angeles taco stand, I could sense an optimistic lightness to Isaiah Woods, the college football player whose battle with mental illness I wrote about last year.
"I feel great," he said. "I feel like I have a whole new life -- and it's one I really like."
When I first met Isaiah, in early 2018, I noticed how naturally upbeat, open and optimistic he was. But then, as I got to know him, I watched as he grew downcast. His face became a sullen mask. Now, during our taco lunch two weeks ago, I saw with relief that his lighthearted grin was back.
And he had given it a flourish.
To highlight his happiness, he had two tiny letters implanted in a front tooth -- LA -- just like the Dodgers' insignia. L.A., the city where he'd been raised, the city that is once again his home.
The letters were 14-karat gold.
Isaiah's story, in The Times on Nov. 15, 2018, told about his nearly fatal battle against anxiety and hopelessness. His affliction peaked in 2015, while he was a freshman receiver for the University of Washington. He had shown great potential. Coaches said he could become a star. Secretly, though, he was hitting the lowest of lows.
Isaiah attempted suicide twice. He was hospitalized in a psychiatric ward, and he left the Huskies during the next spring practice.
He tried to come back two years later. When I began reporting his story, he was about to start playing for Portland State, a smaller school with lower expectations and less pressure. He wanted to perform at a high level. He dreamed of doing well enough to capture the attention of N.F.L. scouts looking for someone tall and powerfully built whom they could count on to catch even the trickiest of passes.
Isaiah made it all the way through his first year in Portland, but it wasn't easy. He rarely played, and he didn't like being a second-stringer far from the bright lights he'd grown used to at a national power like Washington. "Nothing ever really felt right," he said as we sat on tall stools at a Trejo's Tacos, a few miles west of downtown Los Angeles.
Portland State Coach Bruce Barnum had planned for Isaiah to be a big contributor this season. But as spring practice began, Isaiah struggled once more. Getting out of bed became harder and harder. "I started to feel sort of like I did at Washington," he said. "It was some of the dark feelings again.
"I knew it was time for me to leave. I caught myself before it really got bad this time. Caught it way quicker than in Seattle because this time I knew more. I knew the signs."
"I love playing the game of football," he continued, "but not the other stuff that goes with it. I stress myself out way too much."
Isaiah had always prided himself on being a free spirit. He dabbled in art. He loved fashion and design. Unlike many other college athletes, he didn't like wearing anything on campus that would identify him as part of a sports team.
He also tended to chafe at stern authority, at coaches he felt were too strict, too gruff, too much like drill sergeants.
"The culture of football just isn't for me," he said. "When you play football in college, you are not supposed to do anything else, not supposed to have a life that is interesting. Just lift weights, work out and play.
"You're only a football player, and it's not expected that you would really be anything more. I hated that mind-set, not being an individual, not being able to be yourself."
In April, he left Portland State. Mike Lund, the college's athletic department spokesman, said in a telephone interview this month that it seemed Isaiah had lost his passion for the game.
Isaiah said he and his girlfriend, Madison Bickel, who had stood by him during his troubles, decided to split up, though they remain friends.
Despite the tumult, Isaiah, now 22, said he felt better than ever.
And as creative as ever.
He works at a Nordstrom department store near Beverly Hills, where he sells the latest in designer fashions. He said he no longer dreamed about the N.F.L., instead imagining a career in design -- or maybe as a Hollywood art director, "shooting cool videos and all that."
The Times article opened a new world to him. It is still rare to read about a young African-American athlete struggling so openly with mental illness. Readers, he said, responded with deep appreciation. Dozens of them, he said, told him that he had helped them understand depression, anxiety and thoughts of suicide.
He has been invited to speak publicly about easing the stigma of mental illness, particularly for young people and people of color, and did so most recently in September at a Barclays Center conference for youth activists.
He knew that his dark feelings might return and that he had to be vigilant -- aware of his moods, and ready to get help if he needed it. But speaking publicly, he said, was good medicine.
"It really helps to feel like the story of my journey has been helpful to people going through some of the same things," he said. "The kinds of issues I've faced are never anything someone should be ashamed of.
"I want to be part of that change."

Whicker: Santa Anita turns to technology in effort to limit horse tragedies

Texto completo: They will not quit running into each other. They will not quit having heart attacks, or clipping the heels of their competitors. They will not stop getting sick.
But maybe more thoroughbreds will get through this Santa Anita meet alive, thanks to a scanner that deepens the power of probability.
Santa Anita is the first track to use the Mile-Pet Scanner, developed by the veterinary medicine department at UC Davis.
Its purpose is to find things inside a horse’s leg, specifically the ankles, that will cause a problem today and tomorrow.
It will not eliminate tragic outcomes on the racetrack, but the hope is it will keep unfit horses in the barn and perhaps reduce the 2019 death toll of 37, capped by Mongolian Dream in the last steps of the last race of the Breeders’ Cup in November.
Forget all the championship performances that preceded it that weekend, before the arrival of the dreaded Green Screen. The New York Times headlined it like this: “Another Horse’s Death Overshadows Vino Rosso’s Win At Breeders’ Cup Classic.”
According to Dr. Andrew Spriet of UC Davis, the Mile-Pet finds trouble spots in two ways.
“Before, we could only see the images in two dimensions,” he said. “Now we can use three dimensions.
“And before, we could focus on the structural problems. This allows us to see what the molecular issues might be, and we can take action before it becomes a bigger injury.”
Dr. Dionne Benson is the chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita. She points out that most of the concerning injuries involve the ankle, specifically the sesamoid bones.
We have sesamoids, too, but horses have three of them inside each limb, and they provide anchor points for the ligaments. Heavy work can cause the ligaments to rub against those bones and cause damage, which, until now, couldn’t always be seen by imaging technology.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other scans have been involved in racing for many years. But in order to properly examine a horse, you needed comprehensive anesthesia, when the horse has to lie down.
“They can’t tell us how they’re feeling coming out of anesthesia,” Dr. Benson said, “and when they do wake up it can be dangerous for them and the people working with them.”
UC Davis found a scanning technique that bypassed all that. The horses are still sedated, but they are still standing. They can be guided into a wheeled device shaped like a ring that compresses tightly around the leg.
“Since horses can sleep standing up,” Dr. Benson said, “this makes the procedure simpler and also faster.”
Spriet said four horses were recently scanned at UC Davis in a span of 35 minutes. Nine horses at Santa Anita have been examined with the Mile-Pet technology.
Still, there has to be a trigger mechanism to send a horse to the new scanner.
Trainers who feel a horse isn’t reacting normally, or even if the horse’s performance has slipped inexplicably, can ask for a Mile-Pet scan, which begins with the injection of an isotope.
“A lot of people have a misconception about a bone, as if it’s made of steel or some other substance,” Benson said. “A bone is a very active thing, and it changes, particularly after exercise. What this technology does is show us what’s going on before there is a fracture.
“It’s always a challenge, but 80 percent of the problems involve the sesamoid or something else in the fetlock area.”
Spriet emphasizes that the Stronach Group’s investment is a prime reason this technology has become available. There have been complaints about the manner of Santa Anita executives, particularly when it comes to pressuring trainers to fill out fields with horses that the trainers feel aren’t ready to run. But Stronach management, particularly with Craig Fravel on board, seems to realize another 2019 is not survivable.
There are too many downward pressures on horse racing’s popularity, and too many trainers and top horses moving east and south for bigger purses, to tolerate Santa Anita’s image as an equine graveyard.
The track also plans to install a standing MRI at the Nuclear Medical Facility early in 2020.
Spriet has said the Mile-Pet will “transform the diagnostic approach for finding pre-existing conditions in horses.”
Naturally, the picket lines won’t dissipate if the death toll goes down. Nobody applauds a pilot for a safe landing. And the fingernail-chewing will not decrease Saturday when the new meet begins.
It is not about eliminating the risk. For the short term, it’s about eliminating confusion and dread from Santa Anita’s pre-existing conditions.

Texto completo: UPDATE: The teen who was detained under suspicion of being involved with Majors's murder was released Thursday.
--
New York City police detained the 14-year-old suspect who had eluded law enforcement after the murder of Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old
student at Barnard College.
A Manhattan security guard found Majors after she was stabbed to death in a park near the campus earlier this month. Police arrested Zyairr Davis, 13, shortly after finding Majors’ body but were still looking for two other 14-year-old suspects. One of the teens was on his way to meet with police but escaped being taken into custody on Dec. 15 by jumping out of the car, prompting a citywide manhunt.
The teen, who is believed to be the one who stabbed Majors, had been on the run for more than a week after escaping police. Authorities found him in the Bronx on Thursday morning, according to the New York Times.

Authorities noted that the investigation into Majors’ murder is still ongoing, though they believe they have now located the three teens responsible for the apparent mugging-turned-murder.
Davis identified himself and the two 14-year-olds who were involved in the crime while speaking to authorities following his arrest. The other 14-year-old who did not flee police has not spoken to authorities and has obtained an attorney.
The two teens have yet to be named by authorities because they are both minors.

Trump policy change limits penalties for bird deaths

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — As the state of Virginia prepared for a major bridge and tunnel expansion in the tidewaters of the Chesapeake Bay last year, engineers understood that the nesting grounds of 25,000 gulls, black skimmers, royal terns and other seabirds were about to be plowed under.
To compensate, they considered developing an artificial island as a haven. Then in June 2018, the Trump administration stepped in. While the federal government “appreciates” the state’s efforts, new rules in Washington had eliminated criminal penalties for “incidental” migratory bird deaths that came in the course of normal business, administration officials advised. Such conservation measures were now “purely voluntary.”
The state ended its island planning.
The island is one of dozens of bird-preservation efforts that have fallen away in the wake of a policy change in 2017 that was billed merely as a technical clarification to a century-old law protecting migratory birds. Across the country birds have been killed and nests destroyed by oil spills, construction crews and chemical contamination, all with no response from the federal government, according to emails, memos and other documents viewed by the New York Times. Not only has the administration stopped investigating most bird deaths, the documents show, it has discouraged local governments and businesses from taking precautionary measures to protect birds.
In one instance, a Wyoming-based oil company wanted to clarify that it no longer had to report bird deaths to the Fish and Wildlife Service. “You are correct,” the agency replied.
In another, a building property manager in Michigan emailed the Fish and Wildlife Service to note that residents had complained about birds being killed while workers put up siding and gutters around the apartment. Not to worry, the agency replied: “If the purpose or intent of your activity is not to take birds/nests/eggs, then it is no longer prohibited.”
And when a homeowners association in Arizona complained that a developer had refused to safely remove nesting burrowing owls from a nearby lot, Fish and Wildlife said that, because of the new legal interpretation, it could not compel the developer to act.
“Of course, we just got sued over that interpretation, so we’ll see how it ends up,” the enforcement officer wrote.
The revised policy — part of the administration’s broader effort to encourage business activity — has been a particular favorite of President Donald Trump’s, whose selective view of avian welfare has ranged from complaining that wind energy “kills all the birds” to asserting that the oil industry has been subject to “totalitarian tactics” under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.
Habitat loss and pesticide exposure already have brought on widespread bird-species declines. The number of adult breeding birds in the United States and Canada has plummeted by 2.9 billion since 1970.
Now, said Noah Greenwald, the endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity, the Trump administration has engineered “a fundamental shift” in policy that “lets industrial companies, utilities and others completely off the hook.” Even a disaster like the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, which killed or injured about 1 million birds, would not expose a company to prosecution or fines.
Gavin Shire, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency responsible for protecting migratory birds, said in a statement that other federal laws like the Endangered Species Act remain on the books. The Trump administration, he said, “will continue to work cooperatively with our industry partners to minimize impacts on migratory birds.”
The documents tell a different story. In nearly two dozen incidents across 15 states, internal conversations among Fish and Wildlife Service officers indicate that, short of going out to shoot birds, activities in which birds die no longer merit action. In some cases the Trump administration has even discouraged local governments and businesses from taking relatively simple steps to protect birds, like reporting fatalities when they are found.
“You get the sense this policy is not only bad for birds, it’s also cruel,” Greenwald said.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act was originally enacted to protect the birds from overhunting and poaching at a time when feathered hats were all the rage and the snowy egret was hunted almost to extinction. It makes it illegal “by any means or in any manner” to hunt, take, capture or kill birds, nests or eggs from listed species without a permit.
Beginning in the 1970s, federal officials used the act to prosecute and fine companies up to $15,000 per bird for accidental deaths on power lines, in oil pits, in wind turbines and by other industrial hazards.
Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an oil and gas trade association, said fossil fuel companies had been unfairly targeted by the law, pointing to an Obama administration prosecution of seven oil companies in North Dakota for the deaths of 28 birds.
“It felt like it was weaponized against one industry,” she said.
Changes to the interpretation of the law topped the association’s wish list for the Trump administration. Six months after that list was released, the Interior Department ended prosecutions for bird deaths “when the underlying purpose of that activity is not to take birds.”
If landowners destroy a barn knowing it is filled with baby owls, they would not be liable, as long as the intent was not to kill owls, the opinion said. The illegal spraying of a banned pesticide would not be a legal liability either as long as the birds were not the “intended target.”
In the case of the bridge and tunnel project in Hampton Roads, Virginia, Stephen Birch, the commissioner of the Virginia Department of Transportation, said the agency was seeking an alternate solution for the seabirds. A spokeswoman for the agency said the Trump administration’s opinion “had no direct impact” on the decision to abandon the bird island.
But conservationists who had been working closely with the state to protect the seabirds’ nesting grounds said they had no doubt it had a chilling effect.
The loss of the Hampton Roads nesting area will devastate some bird species because it was the last they had.

Texto completo: Remember Martin Scorsese's controversial comments about the Marvel franchise from earlier this year? His daughter does.
Francesca Scorsese, the "Irishman" director's 's 20-year-old daughter, trolled her dad with "Avengers"-themed wrapping paper this Christmas after the director was met backlash in October for saying the Marvel franchise was "not cinema. "
"Look what I'm wrapping my dad's Xmas gifts in," she captioned an Instagram story photo of "Avengers"-themed wrapping paper featuring Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and the Hulk.
The Oscar-winner compared the superhero blockbusters to an amusement park in an interview with Britain's Empire magazine. "Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well-made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks," Scorsese, 77, said.
"I don’t see them. I tried, you know?" he added. "It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being. "
"Guardians of the Galaxy" director James Gunn caught wind of Scorsese's remarks, admitting that they "saddened" him.
"Martin Scorsese is one of my 5 favorite living filmmakers," Gunn, 53, tweeted at the time. "I was outraged when people picketed 'The Last Temptation of Christ' without having seen the film. I’m saddened that he’s now judging my films in the same way. "
Last month Scorsese addressed the backlash in an op-ed for The New York Times, explaining the franchise wasn't his cup of tea because they didn't reflect the same filmmaking artistry he fell in love with as a kid.
"What’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger," he wrote. "Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes. "

Texto completo: Lawyer and activist Anita Hill will give a lecture at the University of Iowa on Jan. 23 titled "From Social Movement to Social Impact: Ending Sexual Harassment."
The lecture, hosted by the University Lecture Committee, will be at the Iowa Memorial Union and is slated to begin at 7 p.m.
Hill made history in 1991 when she testified before a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual harassment she said she experienced working for Clarence Thomas, who was undergoing a nomination-confirmation process for a spot on the U.S. Supreme Court when Hill testified.
Thomas was confirmed to the court, and Hill has since been an advocate to end sexual assault.
After accusations of sexual assault came out against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh in 2017, Hill wrote an op-ed to the New York Times calling on the judiciary committee to take seriously the topic of sexual harassment after her experience testifying nearly three decades ago.
"That was over 28 years ago and today, in the wake of the #MeToo movement, the Judge Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings, and the volatile social and political climate, Anita Hill is more important than ever," the description under the University Lecture Committee's Facebook event read.
Hill teaches law, women's studies, and social policy as a professor at Brandeis University in Massachusetts.

Texto completo: Afghan official says Taliban abducted 26 peace activists
KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.

Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.

Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.

Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."

Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.

Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.

In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo gets excited when talking about the real story behind the film he has shepherded into existence, "Dark Waters." The story centers on lawyer Rob Bilott, whose specialty had been defending corporations, especially chemical manufacturers. Shortly after making partner at his firm, he was drawn into a case that put him squarely on the other side.
"The lawyer knew -- he knew! -- what was happening!" Ruffalo says of Bilott's opposing counsel. "He warned them, 'This guy is not going away. He is one of us; he is a corporate defense attorney, he is not like any of the other guys we are dealing with.' And they were like, 'We'll bury him! Send him everything!' The hubris. They treated him like another plaintiff attorney, but they [messed] with the wrong guy this time."
Ruffalo learned of Bilott from a 2016 New York Times Magazine article, 'The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare." Bilott led a nearly two-decade-long fight that upended his life and tried to hold a chemical giant to account for decades of dumping toxic waste. Ruffalo developed and produced the film, bringing on the writers and director Todd Haynes to make a legal drama focusing on the character's interior life, rather than courtroom tropes.

"It's not phrased this way, but it's a spiritual journey," says Ruffalo, who plays Bilott in "Dark Waters." "He's getting pay cuts. His chance of advancing in that society is suddenly limited. He's all alone. He's got stress at home, stress in the community he's trying to protect. It's an inner, righteous journey very few human beings are willing to take."
The three-time Oscar nominee says Bilott was often on set, and the actor would even have him read dialogue aloud to help capture his cadence, his essence.
"Rob's a very guarded person. He moved around so much as a boy. I see him as a very isolated person from that experience.
"For me, I wanted to know why. Why go to these lengths? He never felt comfortable giving me a complete answer about that. But that deposition scene," Ruffalo says of a sequence in which Bilott questions DuPont's CEO on the record and confronts him with evidence of the damage the company is doing. " 'What are you doing in this scene, what are you after? Yes, it's a deposition, that's happening. But there's something deeper.' He said, 'Honestly, I wanted to connect to him that these were people.' "
"Dark Waters" has elements of Hollywood whistleblower thrillers a la "The Insider" and "Silkwood," but Ruffalo recruited a decidedly non-slick-thriller director, Haynes ("Far From Heaven"; "Carol").
"He tells stories of people who are alienated within oppressive systems and are so alone," says Ruffalo. "And he does it with so much grace and equanimity and really listening to them. This is a legal drama. There's a version of this that is all turning pages and getting the facts out. I wanted to play against that, and I knew he could do that.
"There's the Hollywood version, where Rob's the impenetrable superhero and does the speech and you never see him falter. Then there's the honest version of it, which is a guy who's not your typical hero making this journey. Todd, we both said, 'Let's just tell the truth. Even if it isn't expeditious for us. Even if it isn't cinematic. Let's just keep hauling it down to the real people and the real experience.' That was my guiding light, my North Star, and it was Todd's, too.
"I told him, 'I want to see the Todd Haynes version of this film. The alienation. The loneliness. The interior space. I appreciate the Michael Mann ['Insider'] version of it. But I'm coming to you because what you're going to do with it hasn't been done.' "
Ruffalo says they referenced '70s films such as "All the President's Men" and "The Parallax View" in their preparation, but the focus was always inward.
"That journey that leads a person away from the rest of the world," he says, "it's so moving to me. He's leaving the world as we know it for this greater, inner spiritual journey. Everywhere we look, the world is telling us, 'Things and things and more things! And bigger houses and more money!'
"That was the culture he was living in and wanted so desperately to be part of. And he went down this lonely path that said, 'I'm not here for that. My purpose is different than that.'
"And it cost him."
Noting its lengthy duration, Ruffalo asks, "What is the toll that takes on somebody? One of the things that's remarkable about this story is that he stayed with it that long.
"The world tells us it's best to be selfish; we see so much of that, everywhere we look. So that really touched me. It's 'us,' not 'me.' "

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban ambushed a peace convoy in western Afghanistan and abducted 26 activists who are members of a peace movement, a police spokesman said Wednesday.
The insurgents staged the ambush in the district of Bala Buluk in Farah province on Tuesday. The Taliban forced the six-vehicle convoy to a halt, then got into the cars and drove them and the activists to an unknown location, said provincial police spokesman Mohibullah Mohib.
According to Mohib, a police operation is underway to locate and free the activists whose convoy was going village-to-village to rally for peace.
Bismillah Watandost of the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan, to which the activists belong, said that 27 of their members were abducted by the Taliban in the Farah assault. The different figures could not immediately be reconciled.
The Taliban, who have been active in Farah, have not claimed responsibility for the abductions. However, Watandost also said that tribal elders in the province launched an effort to negotiate with the Taliban to release the abducted activists. He added that phone lines were down in the region, making communication and getting information from the area difficult.
The latest rallies by the activists from the People's Peace Movement of Afghanistan started on Friday, first in southern Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold.
At a similar series of peace rallies in October, the Taliban abducted six activists from the movement in eastern Logar province but released them the same day.
Time and cost of relocation of US base in Okinawa to double
TOKYO - The relocation of a U.S. Marine Corps base to a less-crowded area of the southern Japanese island of Okinawa will take more than twice as much money and time as previously estimated because of the need to stabilize the reclaimed land it will be built on, Japan's government said Wednesday.
The Defense Ministry said the relocation of U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from densely populated Ginowan to Henoko on Okinawa's eastern coast will cost $8.5 billion and take 12 years, pushing its completion into the 2030s. That adds more than a decade to the plan already delayed by more than 20 years because of local opposition.
Under an earlier plan agreed to by Tokyo and Washington in 2013, construction was to cost about $3.2 billion and take five years, with completion expected in about 2022.
Michigan AG asserts Nassar probe not suspended after all
LANSING, Mich. - Michigan's attorney general on Wednesday said her communications director's statement declaring the suspension of a nearly two-year criminal investigation into Michigan State University's handling of complaints against sexual abuser Larry Nassar was "inadvertently misleading."
Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a written statement that the investigation is ongoing.
The probe, which began under Nessel's predecessor, has resulted in charges against three former school officials. One was convicted. Two others, including former President Lou Anna Simon, were ordered to trial.
"For the record, I remain deeply committed to finding the truth about who knew what about Larry Nassar at MSU, " Nessel said.
Songwriter Allee Willis, who penned 'Friends' theme, dies
LOS ANGELES - Allee Willis, a songwriter whose work included the Broadway musical "The Color Purple" as well as the theme song from the TV show "Friends" and Earth, Wind & Fire's "September," has died. She was 72.
The cause of death Tuesday was a cardiac event, The New York Times reported, but did not specify where she died, though she had been living in Los Angeles.
Willis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018 - more than 30 years after she won a Grammy for co-writing Patti LaBelle's "Stir It Up" for the "Beverly Hills Cop" soundtrack.
She was also nominated for an Emmy for the "Friends" theme song, "I'll Be There for You" performed by the Rembrandts but lost to the theme of "Star Trek: Voyager."
Burning Man organizers sue over US permit fees
RENO, Nev. - Burning Man organizers sued the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to recover millions of dollars they say the government has overcharged them in fees over the past seven years at the counterculture celebration.
Black Rock City LLC, the nonprofit that produces the annual Burning Man event, filed the lawsuit Dec. 13 in U.S. District Court in Washington.
Organizers told the Reno Gazette Journal they're tired of waiting over the past four years for the bureau to provide justification for the nearly $3 million it charges annually for a permit to hold the 80,000-person event in the Black Rock Desert about 100 miles north of Reno.
In recent years, Black Rock City has been required to reimburse the BLM, which provides law enforcement and oversight at the event, for its services and expenses.
Relief group: 216,000 have fled homes in NW Syria
BEIRUT - More than 200,000 men, women and children fled their homes in northwest Syria in buses, trucks and cars in recent weeks, amid intense air and ground bombardment by government forces, a Syrian relief group said Wednesday.
Government forces have been bombarding southern and eastern Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold in the country, since late November. A ground offensive that began last week has displaced more people and government forces have captured more than 40 villages and hamlets, according to the Syrian army and opposition activists.
The Syrian Response Coordination Group, a relief organization, said 216,632 people have fled their homes, many of them with no specific place to go. Many have been heading toward the Turkish border for safety.
In Chile: Helicopters on Wednesday dropped water on the outskirts of the Chilean port city of Valparaiso to extinguish a fire that destroyed about 150 homes.
Dozens of people living in the city's Rocuant and San Roque hills sifted through the ruins of their homes after the fire, fanned by strong winds, swept through their neighborhoods on Tuesday. Residents had been evacuated and there were no reports of casualties.
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel said authorities believe arson caused the blaze and urged people to report any suspicious activity.
The fire was doused in urban areas but remains "active" in the woods, said Ricardo Toro, head of the national emergency office.

Legal West Bank settlements another step to disaster

Texto completo: Last month, under the direction of President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo changed U.S. policy by announcing that the Israeli settlements on the West Bank are legal, in spite of international law under Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 stating: "The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies."
World opinion and legal experts in international law still consider the settlements illegal. This means little to Trump, who wanted to please the evangelical religious right and right-wing Jewish donors, especially Sheldon Adelson who gave the Trump campaign $30 million. Netanyahu immediately tweeted that Trump's decision "rights a historical wrong."
That tweet was expected. What was not expected was the reaction by Bret Stephens, a conservative columnist for the New York Times. Under the headline "On the West Bank, at least, Trump gets something right," Stephens praised Trump for not being stuck in a "time warp," by which Stephens means that the accepted truths of the last 50 years no longer hold true.
Stephens argues that recognizing the legality of the West Bank settlements will have no effect on the pursuit of peace between Israel and the Palestinians. He denies that "settlement construction is a principal obstruction to peace. This is all nonsense."
Stephen's most disturbing assertion is that, "Israel withdrew all of its settlers and soldiers from the Gaza Strip in 2005. The result was more war, not less...Peace, if it comes, will not be the result of a diplomatic solution...It will happen as a cultural evolution, in which a new generation of Palestinian leaders dedicate themselves to building up the institutions of a decent state rather than attacking those of their neighbors."
This is an often-stated canard: "You give them freedom and they attack us. You can't trust or deal with the Palestinians." I expected Stephens to be more sophisticated than to support this distortion of history.
Let me provide some historical background: Although then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon pulled the Jewish settlements and the Israeli military out of Gaza in 2005, it was not with the intent of making peace with the Palestinians. Dov Weisglass, Sharon's senior advisor, summed it up succinctly: "The disengagement (from Gaza) is actually formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so that there will not be a political process with the Palestinians...this whole package that is called the Palestinian state has been removed from our agenda indefinitely."
The Israelis immediately hermetically sealed Gaza. The lone airport strip was bombed so that there could be no contact with the outside world by plane. The crossing points between Gaza and Israel and Egypt were shut tight, thereby destroying the ability of the Palestinians to export any agricultural or manufactured products. These crossing points were open only for a trickle of food and medical supplies.
The Gaza seacoast was patrolled by Israeli gunboats to assure there would be no entry or exit by sea. Gaza was under the complete control of Israel. In essence, Israel never returned Gaza to the Palestinians. As a result of this, Hamas won a democratic election in 2007. After this victory, Israel tightened the screws on Gaza even more. Weisglass quipped that the Gazans were being "put on a diet."
Israel then proceeded to decrease the amount of food that UNRWA (the UN relief agency) could truck into the Gaza Strip. The people were reduced from Weisglass' diet to near starvation. A British journalist, writing for The Independent, reported, "When I was last in besieged Gaza...I met hungry children stumbling around the streets scavenging for food."
Put yourself in a Palestinian's shoes. Cornered in an open-air jail, would you not respond militarily? Yet Stephens blames the victim, rather than the perpetrator. In this case, Israel continued and exacerbated the ongoing war with Hamas that Israel struggles with today.
This brings us back to Trump's recognition of the West Bank settlements as legal and Netanyahu's tweet in response: "This policy reflects an historical truth - that the Jewish people are not foreign colonists in Judea and Samaria (Orthodox designation for the West Bank)."
The official designation of the illegal settlements as legal by the Trump administration is not an innocuous statement. It is another building block in a Greater Israel, a one-state solution. We should take it seriously.

Playing Nancy Pelosi's impeachment games

Texto completo: Did anyone else not watch the Democrat presidential debate on TV last Thursday night? I thought so.
After three months of watching Saint Nancy Pelosi and her House Democrats stage their solemn impeachment circus, I decided to skip the latest "historic" debate. I figure I had suffered enough.
Only seven Democrats – a couple of socialists, a couple of zillionaires, a couple of moderates and small-town mayor from Indiana – qualified for last week's primary debate in L.A.
Did moderate old Joe Biden have a "commanding performance" that quelled what the New York Times' pre-debate piece called "the quiet rumblings" about his "abilities and long-term strength"?
Did the leftwing oldsters Liz and Bernie beat up moderate young Mayor Pete for being insufficiently socialist or a member of the donor class?
Did entrepreneur Andrew Yang, billionaire Tom Steyer, Sen. Amy Klobuchar or anyone else say anything new, interesting, bold or politically unpredictable?
Based on previous debates, I doubt all of the above.
I bet the seven Democrats on stage gave the same false promises and same canned answers to the same softball questions we've heard a hundred times before.
Meanwhile, in Washington, where the Democrats' two weak and fuzzy articles of impeachment were supposed to travel from the House to the Senate for a trial, Mother Pelosi was playing games as usual.
Now she wants a quid pro quo with the Senate – "Do the trial the way I want, or I won't send over the articles of impeachment."
Pelosi and other House Democrats have said over and over that they are impeaching the president, not for partisan reasons, but because it is their sacred duty to uphold the Constitution. Yeah, right.
Everyone knows what it's really all about – their blind hatred for Trump for his having beaten Hillary in 2016. Democrats have been shoving this phony impeachment stuff down the country's throat for three months, but the irony is that they've only succeeded in strengthening the president and weakening themselves.
Because of their impossible dream to impeach and remove President Trump, everything is going in reverse for the Democrats.
They've already lost one moderate House congressman from New Jersey who's switching to Republican and, according to the polls, impeachment has not hurt Trump with independent voters.
Despite Pelosi's maneuvering and the fevered hopes of Democrats and the liberal media, impeachment is going nowhere. President Trump will never be convicted and removed by two-thirds of the Republican Senate and chances are getting better every day that he'll be reelected next fall.
If there was a silver lining at the end of last week, it's that Congress has closed down their partisan circus and gone home for Christmas so the rest of us can have a happy holiday. Merry Christmas to all.

Texto completo: RIO RANCHO, N.M. — At the age of 6, Michelle Rusk says, she knew she wanted to be a writer – and someday have one of her books listed on the New York Times list of best sellers.
“I used to make little books,” she said, of her time growing up in a Chicago suburb.
Several decades later, she has easily surpassed her first goal ­­— she’s a writer with 11 books and another one soon to be published — but that “Times” goal still looms large.
No problem: She’ll keep writing and enjoying life, which for her begins at 4:30 every morning for a jump-start on another day and a chance to see the sun rise above the Sandia Mountains.
The multi-talented wife of Cleveland High School Spanish teacher and varsity girls soccer coach Greg Rusk, Michelle prefers to avoid the limelight.
“I was groomed to be a writer,” she said, and she has a résumé to back up that statement.
She attended Ball State University and was a sports writer, covering the women’s basketball team, for the school’s newspaper before becoming the beat writer for the men’s basketball team when the previous writer flunked out. She covered the basketball team in the NCAA tournament and the football team in a bowl game.
She also reported on the USA’s boxing team from the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs and worked the 1996 Summer Olympics.
She covered the first-round game of the 1993 NCAA “dance,” with her Cardinals about to face Kansas, but then received horrific news the next day: Her younger sister had committed suicide.
“I didn’t find out my sister had killed herself until the next day. While she did it during the (NCAA tournament) game, my parents didn’t know, either, because she was supposed to be in school and they weren’t alarmed until she didn’t come home that afternoon.
“I shared a room with my sister for 11 years,” Rusk said, holding back tears. “We did everything together (when we were younger): sewed, drew, did creativity together.”
The experience provided inspiration for her first book, “Do They have Bad Days in Heaven?” and led to a role as a speaker on the subject and, later, as the president for two years of the American Association of Suicidology.
“Nobody wanted to talk about it,” she said.
But, she was willing and, regardless of if all the days in heaven are fun-filled, she’s in no hurry to get there.
“I’m in no hurry to leave – I have things to do,” she said. “I don’t identify with the pain; it’s what you do with the pain.”
Although she doesn’t have a bucket list, per se, she’s completed her 12th book and is in search of a publisher for it; has traveled around the world and wants to keep doing that with Greg; and will stay busy at home, where, “Writing makes me happy; I sew; I paint; I create.”
She’s also quite the cook.
Her creations are evident throughout the couple’s home.
Speaking of the couple, they were set up on a blind date, but as it turned out, they had a lot in common.
Michelle had also been a teacher and coach, working at Del Norte High School. In her teen years, she had been a runner, and was an assistant of the Knights’ cross country and track & field teams. She had come to Albuquerque in 1994 to get her master’s at the University of New Mexico – “One of two schools near mountains,” she quipped.
“It was really hard to get a teaching job in the mid-90s,” she recalled. “There just weren’t many open jobs like there are now. It was before ‘No Child Left Behind’ and all that testing, which did change things.”
She and Greg began dating in September 2013 and were wed in June 2015.
Her 11th book, “That Cooking Girl,” is what Rusk calls “a fun story” and is set in Albuquerque. Although fictional and not about her, it has actual Albuquerque sites mentioned throughout.
Her 12th book is about a 1986 family vacation on Route 66, from Chicago to Los Angeles – also not about herself, she affirmed.
“Every book I write, I get better,” she said, with a smile.
She still isn’t over the loss of her beloved sister, but just seeing the sun appear over the mountains inspires her to carry on because, “It’s gonna be a beautiful day.”
You can find Rusk’s books on amazon.com. You can keep up with her blogs and products at chellesummer.com.

Texto completo: David Trott, the Oakland County Republican who served two terms in Congress, blasted President Donald Trump in a letter to the editor of The Atlantic, saying Trump is unfit for office and should be removed.
"Trump is psychologically, morally, intellectually, and emotionally unfit for office," Trott wrote in the letter, which appeared in the print magazine but not online, calling Trump's actions in office "frightening."
He said Trump's "inability to follow normal decision-making protocols has created chaos in our foreign policy and put our country at risk."
"We can only hope Congress impeaches and removes him so we have a choice between two adults in 2020."
Trott made similar comments in a front page article of the New York Times on Sunday in which it became clear why he didn't seek a third two-year term in 2018 representing Michigan's 11th Congressional District.
Trott said that during a closed door meeting with fellow Republican lawmakers in the summer of 2017 he had expressed concerns about Trump's erratic behavior. The word quickly got back to the president and Trott decided not to seek re-election rather than face Trump's wrath and the likelihood of a primary challenge.
Many Republican lawmakers feel Trump is unfit for office, Trott told the newspaper, but are fearful of saying so publicly.
Meshawn Maddock, chairwoman of the 11th Congressional District Republican Committee, was quoted in the Detroit News as calling Trott a "Democrat in disguise," She said Trott had abandoned his constituents, allowing a Democrat to win his old seat.
On Sunday, Maddock, co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans, tweeted that Trott refused to donate to 11th District Republicans. "So Trott please crawl back into your very little hole."
Democrat Haley Stevens won Trott's seat in the 2018 election. The district covers portions of southwestern Oakland County and northwest Wayne County.
In the letter published in The Atlantic, Trott said he "will now have to consider voting for a Democrat" for president.
"High unemployment, a stagnating economy, and massive debt for a few years are better than alienating the rest of our allies, getting into a nuclear war with Iran, and allowing 10,000 Islamist soldiers to be set free in Syria," Trott wrote.

Texto completo: With Maximum Security, Luis Saez had the greatest ride of his life on the first Saturday in May. Until he didn't.
The New York Times Sports department is revisiting the subjects of some compelling articles from the last year or so. Here is our May report on the Kentucky Derby disqualification of Maximum Security .
Luis Saez has watched the replay too many times. He has watched it with the Hall of Fame riders he competes against daily; with the horse trainers who employ him; alone at night at his home in New York.
The video dates to the first Saturday in May, and Saez is turning for home on a colt named Maximum Security, looking to all the world to be the clear winner of the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby.
He crosses the finish line first. He remembers his heart leaping out of his chest, his hand rubbing his champion colt. Now, all Saez has to do is get the colt to the winner's circle. He needs to make space for the blanket of roses that comes with winning America's most famous race.
The colt's trainer, Jason Servis, is standing on a wet track turned as gooey as peanut butter and is barely able to speak.
"I had just given that colt the ride of my life," said Saez, 27, "and no one was celebrating."
Soon, he discovered why. Two of his rivals had claimed that Maximum Security had interfered with their horses down the stretch. It did appear the colt jumped a puddle on the rain-soaked track while turning for home. Saez had felt Maximum Security drift to the right, but he squared the colt's shoulders quickly and they finished nearly two lengths ahead of their nearest challenger.
Suddenly, the world was introduced to the pioneers of video review in sports: racing stewards. Saez watched the replay of the race and saw why Maximum Security got spooked. Tyler Gaffalione, aboard War of Will, tried to shoot through a hole that was not there. Gaffalione's colt got tangled with Maximum Security, and Gaffalione was nearly thrown.
For the next 22 minutes, Saez's actions in the stretch were replayed and dissected, by the more than 150,000 people at Churchill Downs, the millions more watching on national television and, most important, the three stewards sitting in a dark room atop the clubhouse.
"He ran up on my horse," Saez told himself. "There was no way they were going to take me down."
Saez was wrong. The stewards determined that Maximum Security had interfered with other horses. The runner-up, Country House, a 65-1 shot, was declared the winner. Instead of notching a career achievement, Saez became the rider of the only Derby winner to be disqualified for interference.
"That's horse racing," said Maximum Security's owner, Gary West, as he was leaving the winner's circle. "Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. Sometimes you win and you lose all in the same race."
By the next morning, West had changed his tune. He filed an appeal with Kentucky horse racing officials. It was denied. In the months since, West has unsuccessfully pursued a reversal in the courts.
On the first Saturday of December, after Maximum Security won the prestigious Cigar Mile at Aqueduct, Servis, too, could not hide his disappointment.
It didn't matter that his colt has won seven of nine races for more than $ 1.8 million in earnings. He would trade them all for the feeling he had when Maximum Security had seemingly delivered him his first Derby victory.
"I've got to hold back tears," Servis told reporters afterward. "He's special, that horse. It's just a shame because he was the best horse in the Derby."
Saez was suspended for 15 days for failing to control his mount. He has appealed the penalty, so he has not had to serve that suspension yet. In June, New York regulators suspended him for seven days for a bumping incident at Belmont Park.
Saez is trying to put the hurt behind.
At first, he worried that the disqualification would hurt his business. It hasn't -- he is in seventh place in the national jockey standings with nearly $ 18 million in purse earnings.
Besides, Saez knows what real grief feels like.
In 2014, his brother Juan died after a spill in a race at Indiana Grand Racing & Casino. He was just 17 and had followed Luis to the famed Laffit Pincay Jr. Technical Jockey Training Academy in their native Panama. Juan then followed Luis to America.
At the time of his death, Juan had won 90 races in just four months and was one of the nation's top apprentice riders. Luis was home in Panama to surprise his father on his birthday when the accident occurred.
He got the call about his brother. He delivered the news to his parents.
Saez knows how dangerous riding a 1,100-pound horse at 35 miles per hour can be. He knows how blessed he is to have the talent that will probably land him in the Hall of Fame. He also knows how quickly it can be taken away -- something he says that he thinks about each time he walks through his door and sees his three young daughters.
He says Maximum Security is the best horse he has been on. He knows that they won the 145th running of the Kentucky Derby together.
"Maybe there is another Derby winner out there for me," he said. "Until then, every day, I get up, hold my head high and work hard. Let's see what God's plan is for me."

For Boeing, A New Chief To Temper Its Troubles

Texto completo: Over decades, as an executive at G.E. and Blackstone, Mr. Calhoun has been hailed as an experienced and decisive operator.
As the new chief executive of Boeing, David L. Calhoun will take on one of the most challenging tasks in corporate America: steering the embattled airplane manufacturer out of a crisis that has consumed it for more than a year.
Boeing's best-selling jet, the 737 Max, has been grounded for 10 months after two deadly crashes exposed serious flaws in the jet's design and led to scrutiny of the company's manufacturing process and its dealings with regulators, as well as to accusations that it overlooked safety concerns in its competitive zeal.
But while the magnitude of the task has little precedent, this is not the first time that Mr. Calhoun, who has longstanding ties to the aviation industry, has had to navigate a period of corporate turmoil. Over decades as an executive at companies like General Electric, Nielsen and Blackstone, he has been hailed as a "turnaround specialist" and described by colleagues as an experienced and decisive operator.
Mr. Calhoun, 62, started his career at G.E., rising to run the company's airplane-engine business in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Later, as chief executive of Nielsen, he was credited with rebuilding the data and information firm after a private-equity takeover. And in 2017, he was made chairman of the board of Caterpillar as the construction equipment company faced scrutiny from the federal government over its tax and export practices.
"He's somebody people trust," said Kevin Sharer, a former chief executive of the drugmaker Amgen and a close friend of Mr. Calhoun's who overlapped with him at G.E. "He doesn't bring emotion. He brings logic and conviction."
Mr. Calhoun will replace Dennis A. Muilenburg as Boeing's chief executive on Jan. 13, the company said on Monday. A member of the company's board of directors since 2009, he became chairman in October when Mr. Muilenburg was stripped of that title as the company continued to struggle in the aftermath of the crashes -- one in Indonesia and the other in Ethiopia -- that left 346 people dead.
Since he joined G.E. after graduating from Virginia Tech in 1979, Mr. Calhoun has built a career on firm decision-making and an ability to execute ambitious strategies step by step, according to interviews with former colleagues.
He thrived under the mentorship of G.E.'s longtime chief executive, Jack Welch, and became known as a blunt and forceful leader. When he settled on a decision, he pursued it relentlessly, former colleagues say.
"He was very, very clear in his communication," said Paul Mirabella, who ran G.E.'s global diagnostic imaging unit from 2003 to 2006. "If you worked for David, you were never confused about what the mission was."
Toward the end of his tenure at G.E., Mr. Calhoun was courted by a number of major companies. In 2006, The New York Times reported that it was "common knowledge among analysts" that Boeing had offered him the chief executive job a year earlier. But Mr. Calhoun decided to take over Nielsen, which a group of private equity firms had acquired.
There, he streamlined the business by selling several magazines, including The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard Magazine. He also recorded a major victory in 2011 when Walmart agreed to share consumer sales information with Nielsen after keeping the data private for many years.
In 2017, Mr. Calhoun took over as chairman of Caterpillar shortly after federal agents raided the company's headquarters. And he has led the portfolio-operations group at Blackstone since 2013.
"Dave is an incredibly capable, super talented executive," said Jonathan Gray, the president and chief operating officer at Blackstone. "I'm sure Boeing saw in the boardroom how capable he was."
At Blackstone, Mr. Calhoun was involved in discussions with senior executives about the firm's new life sciences initiatives, which were unveiled in 2018. At a meeting three years ago, most of the officials in the room spoke in broad strokes about the future of health care, recalled Mr. Sharer, who was at the meeting. But not Mr. Calhoun. He focused on the nuts and bolts: Where do we invest? Whom do we hire?
"We're all dreaming about how beautiful the cathedral is going to look," Mr. Sharer said. "And he kept saying, 'How are we going to build it?"'
Throughout Boeing's crisis, Mr. Calhoun has been the face of the board, often reaffirming its support for Mr. Muilenburg in media appearances. But it was never entirely clear whether he had his eyes on the top job.
In an interview with Virginia Tech Daily in 2018, Mr. Calhoun emphasized his desire to maintain an even work-life balance, noting that he learned the importance of setting aside time for his family from one of his mentors at G.E.
"He had found this wonderful balance. He clearly told me how imbalanced I was," said Mr. Calhoun, who is married and has four children. "I can probably work around the clock, but that's not a healthy thing, and you miss out on a lot."
Still, over the course of his career, he has repeatedly shown an appetite for new challenges. In 2010, he told an interviewer that he had left G.E. partly because he had wanted a "a little anxiety" in his professional life.
He will get plenty of that as chief executive of Boeing. Over the last year, the company has faced intense criticism from regulators, Congress and the families of the people who died in the two crashes.
Last week, Boeing temporarily suspended production of the Max, disrupting a vast international supply chain that stretches across thousands of companies. Mr. Calhoun spent much of Monday speaking with Boeing's customers and government regulators, as well as other public officials, a Boeing spokesman said.
In an interview with The Times in May, Mr. Calhoun made clear what he viewed as Boeing's main priority. "There's really only one thing to do, and that's to get a safe airplane back up in the sky and let it fly," he said. "I mean, that's really all we can do."
"Oh, by the way," he added. "That will all happen. That is what we do."

John Borger: More than a brilliant lawyer, he was a great man

Texto completo: By now, the Twin Cities media and legal communities have heard of the passing of John Borger, as have readers of the local newspapers and, yes, even The New York Times, where an obituary served as testament to the national importance of the life he lived.
John, one of the country’s pre-eminent First Amendment lawyers, died Dec. 16 at the age of 68. He spent his 40-year career practicing law at Faegre Baker Daniels (Faegre & Benson, when he joined it). During that time, he led the development of the law relied upon by those who speak truth to power, defending journalists in libel litigation, protecting them from subpoenas, and ensuring they could access government information and judicial records.
But what eludes capture in the long list of cases he handled are the sentiments conveyed to me since he died by people from across the country — some who saw him just once or twice a year at legal conferences. Even these casual acquaintances intuitively know: John was more than a great lawyer; he was a great man.
Many a brilliant lawyer is just that: Brilliant at the law, but singularly focused on that pursuit, forsaking the diversity of experiences and the pausing to be human that make life worth living. Not John.
In the decade-plus I worked under his tutelage, I had many opportunities to learn from the example he set, but two incidents in particular stand out.
The first was when I was a fairly young associate, trying to figure out how to balance the demands of motherhood with a career in “big law.” One day I came in late, having spent the morning reading to my son’s day care class. I will never forget what John said when I saw him.
While many partners of his gender and generation might have been noticeably annoyed or simply said nothing, John went out of his way to tell me how important it is to take time to do what I had done — how finding work-life balance is hard, but can be done and is so worth it. It meant the world to me, even more so because I knew he spoke from experience: John’s wife, Judy, had an important career of her own as a Twin Cities journalist and together they juggled the raising of three great kids, now three great adults.
The second incident was a year or two later, when I was discussing some firm policy with John. I must have rolled my eyes, conveying disbelief that the firm was doing anything more than paying lip service to the issue. John stopped me with a gentle reprimand. I wish I could remember his exact words. But he essentially said not to go looking for shadows lurking in dark corners. Assume the best of people, he was saying. Take them at their word, at least until they give you reason not to.
Like any good journalist, John was often skeptical. But I never saw him cynical. He questioned people’s judgment, but rarely their motives. He understood that there is enough adversity in the world — certainly in the practice of law — without going looking for it among your friends, colleagues, and allies. It’s a lesson I will never forget.
Not all of us will get to take a case to the U.S. Supreme Court, as John did, or be named, as John was, a Champion of the First Amendment, the highest honor from the American Bar Association Forum on Communications Law. (John was only the third to receive this prestigious award.)
But the things that made John one of the giants of my life — his generosity of spirit, his patience, his commitment to a worthy cause — are things all of us can model. What a wonderful life he led and what a wonderful, many-layered legacy he left.

The 12 podcasts of 2019 you need to listen to

Texto completo: My favorite podcasts of 2019 were those that seemed at first about one thing — Dolly Parton, the reality TV show “Cops,” the mysterious death of New York City punk rocker nearly four decades ago — and carried you away on tangents you never saw coming.
Which, mind you, is not to say I lost all of my ardor for the tried-and-true-crime podcasts, such as “In The Dark,” my favorite of 2018, which just this week resulted in the release on bail of Curtis Flowers, a Mississippi man tried six times who six times had his convictions overturned. There remain plenty of those, though I’ve perhaps become more discerning in my criminal tastes.
The list below presents the dozen podcasts that still resonate for me as the year comes to an end. They’re not in any particular order, so the numbers aren’t rankings, but the first two here are my favorites of the year.
1. Headlong: Running From Cops : Dan Taberski returned this year with his third great podcast in a row – “Surviving Y2K” and “Finding Richard Simmons” preceded this one – and this might be his best. A deep dive into the history of the reality TV series “Cops,” this podcast explores everything from the impact of the show on real-world policing to the way the series may interfere with the rights of the arrested in ways you’d never considered. Entertaining, and it makes you think.
2. The Ballad of Billy Balls : This podcast opens like a typical true-crimer – who killed punk rocker and small-time drug dealer Billy Balls in his East Village apartment in 1982 – but under the empathetic storytelling of host iO Tillett Wright it becomes something much more that incorporates love and grief, family and memory. Billy’s girlfriend Rebecca is an amazing presence throughout the podcast, which reveals one secret after another as Wright seeks the truth of the story.
3. 1619 : This podcast from the New York Times came on the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves in America. No dry history lesson, the anthology-style five-episode podcast looks at ways in which the impact of slavery has rippled across four centuries of our history tot he present day. Topics range from the economy to land ownership to health care. If you’d like to get a sense of it, dip your ears into the episode by the Times’ Wesley Morris who explores the ways in which black American music seeded every genre we listen to today — including yacht rock.
4. Dolly Parton’s America : Host Jad Abumrad grew up in Tennessee where Dolly Parton is everywhere, and, like many, he took her a little bit for granted. Then Abumrad noticed how in these divided times everyone from MAGA hat-wearers to drag queens loves Dolly, and he started to investigate. He got hours of interview time with Dolly, which is wonderful, but it’s the side trips into the stories of those who know her – in person, by her music, her career – that make this story a wonderful narrative about a singular woman.
5. Crime Beat: Mom vs. Murderer : The second season of this true-crime podcast by reporter Keith Sharon, our (full-disclosure) Southern California News Group colleague, tells the story of the murder of Cathy Torrez in 1994 and the 21 years her mother Mary Bennett fought to see the main suspect — who lived across the street — convicted. It’s a story about a terrible crime, the frustrating injustices of the justice system and a mother’s determination that her child not be forgotten.
6. Lost Notes : This anthology series from KCRW-FM/89.9 and host Jessica Hooper explores the lives and work of musicians in ways unlike any other podcast, digging deep into history and meaning with strong standalone narratives. A punk rock musician with a regional hit when he was 17 questions the sexism of its lyrics as a 56-year-old father. The sisters of the now mostly forgotten all-female rock band Fanny share their story. A writer narrates an audio letter to the musician Cat Power about the impact of her work on the lives of him and others. There are more in 2019’s second season.
7. The Clearing : April Balascio had feared for years that her father Edward Wayne Edwards was a murderer, and in 2009, her tip led to his conviction in a decades-old case. In this podcast, she teams with host Josh Dean to explore the legacy of her father’s life and crimes. These included more murders to which he admitted, several more that he likely committed and a few he almost certainly did not. It’s a fascinating tale of a sociopath father and a daughter brave enough to seek the truth.
8. Against The Rules with Michael Lewis : Writer Lewis is responsible for some of the great nonfiction of the past few decades with books such as “Moneyball,” “The Blind Side,” and “The Big Short,” all of which were adapted for film. This debut podcast brings his unique and questioning mind to the topic of fairness. He explores everything from sports to financial markets, law to media, and what happens in a world where fewer people accept the judgments of referees. Smart, funny, thought-provoking — what else you want?
9. Over My Dead Body:Tally : There’s a nasty divorce between two lawyers, and one of them ends up gunned down in the garage at his Tallahassee, Florida home. Host and co-reporter Matthew Shaer takes listeners through the story, which moves from a fairy-tale romance that made the New York Times to the split and crime that followed. This first season of the podcast makes it easy for listeners to come to their own conclusions about who is responsible, but justice isn’t so easily served.
10. Nice Try! : Host Avery Trufelman explores the history of intended utopian communities — the Jamestown settlement, the master-planned modernist city of Chandigarh, India, the Oneida religious commune in New York, among others — and why so often they have failed to find the perfection for which they were intended. Through history, architecture, culture, and beliefs, Nice Try! presents a cool new way of understanding the worlds in which we live.
11. The Thing About Pam : From NBC and “Dateline,” this Keith Morrison-hosted podcast peels back the layers of lies and deceit that led to the wrongful conviction of a Missouri man for the murder of his wife, and the ultimate discovery of whodunnit. “Saturday Night Live” used to skewer Morrison’s intimate style of narration, but it’s a pleasure indeed to listen to him tell this story, which never lags or feels padded like too many “Dateline” episodes do.
12. It’s a Pixies Podcast : The Pixies, one of the great modern rock bands, agreed to something few bands would consider and invited author-turned-podcaster Tony Fletcher into the recording studio for the weeks they worked on their new album, “Beneath The Eyrie.” It’s a fascinating look at the creative process, the collaborative nature of making a record, and the push-and-pull of personalities all working toward the goal of making music together. A must for Pixies’ fans, but almost as essential for fans of any band for the insights it delivers.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has signed an important and timely executive order clarifying that prohibited activities covered by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 include anti-Semitism.
Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in any program or activity where federal funds are provided. Thus, a primary target here is our colleges and universities.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, in 2017, acts of anti-Semitism had increased 57% nationwide over 2016, increased 89% on college campuses and increased 94% at K-12 schools.
We should be as concerned in America about anti-Semitism as we are about racism. But this initiative is getting criticism in some circles.
One allegation is that it will stifle free speech on college campuses, intimidating those who want to criticize Israel. But this confuses the cure with the disease.
Free speech is being stifled now on politicized campuses across the nation.
I have spoken at hundreds of universities over the last 20 years. It has never been more difficult for me to speak to students and share my views as a Christian conservative pro-life black woman without being harassed, sometimes violently. I've had engagements canceled because of political pressure on campus.
Other conservative speakers have similar experiences. The recently released documentary "No Safe Spaces" focuses on the politicization of our university campuses and the intimidation of free speech.
Too often the same happens to those who go to universities to speak on behalf of Israel. Those who disagree are not interested in civil and enlightened exchange of views. They simply want to shut down, sometimes with violence, those with whom they disagree. They want to shut out supporters of the state of Israel.
According to the nonpartisan Freedom House that issues annual reports on the state of freedom around the world, of 21 countries and territories in the Middle East and North Africa, only two are ranked "free": Israel and Tunisia. And Israel is the most free.
Where are all the protests about the other 19 countries and territories in the region, populated by some 400 million people who are not free?
If anti-Semitism does not explain why the freest country in the Middle East, the only Jewish country in the world, is the only one drawing protests and hostility, what is the explanation?
Another line of misguided criticism of this executive order is the claim that it defines Judaism as a nationality.
Anyone who buys this bogus line, first peddled by The New York Times, should read the order and see that it is not true.
Anti-Semitism is an ancient scourge, which has produced a new strain in our time with the emergence of the state of Israel.
Jewish students at universities may be subject to harassment and discrimination because of the hostile environment to Israel on campuses. It is this problem that this new executive order addresses. It does not define, or redefine, Judaism as a nationality.
The whole point of the civil rights movement, which culminated in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was the protection of the freedom and dignity of every American.
The evil of all discrimination, be it anti-Semitism or racism, is depriving individuals of their humanity by pretending that they can be defined by what they look like or where they come from.
This points to the sad irony of the identity politics that has gripped and swept the nation and our university campuses. It does exactly what the civil rights movement tried to eliminate: defines individuals by what they look like or where they come from.
President Trump was elected in 2016 because his Make America Great Again message resonated with voters tired of political correctness and identity politics.
Our country is about core principles, universally true for all, that secure and protect individual freedom and dignity.
This is what this new executive order is about.

What About Centrist Bias?

Texto completo: The media has a bigger problem than liberal bias.
John F. Harris is about as mainstream as the mainstream media gets. He spent 21 years at The Washington Post, including as its political editor. Then he became the founding editor of Politico, where he is now a columnist.
Last month, Harris wrote a column that I can't get out of my head. In it, he argued that political journalism suffers from "centrist bias." As he explained, "This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is."
The bias caused much of the media to underestimate Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Donald Trump in 2016. It also helps explain the negative tone running through a lot of the coverage of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this year.
Centrist bias, as I see it, confuses the idea of centrism (which is very much an ideology) with objectivity and fairness. It's an understandable confusion, because American politics is dominated by the two major parties, one on the left and one on the right. And the overwhelming majority of journalists at so-called mainstream outlets -- national magazines, newspapers, public radio, the non-Fox television networks -- really are doing their best to treat both parties fairly.
In doing so, however, they often make an honest mistake: They equate balance with the midpoint between the two parties' ideologies. Over the years, many press critics have pointed out one weakness of this approach: false equivalence, the refusal to consider the possibility that one side of an argument is simply (or mostly) right.
But that's not the only problem. There's also the possibility that both political parties have been wrong about something and that the solution, rather than being roughly halfway between their answers, is different from what either has been proposing.
This seemingly radical possibility turns out to be quite common, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. -- author of the classic book, "The Vital Center," no less -- pointed out. The abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, labor rights, the New Deal, civil rights for black Americans, Reagan's laissez-faire revolution and same-sex marriage all started outside the boundaries of what either party favored. "The most consequential history," Harris wrote, "is usually not driven by the center."
Political and economic journalism too often assumes otherwise and treats the center as inherently sensible. This year's Democratic presidential campaign has been a good case study. The skeptical questions posed to the more moderate Democrats are frequently about style or tactics: Are you too old? Too young? Too rich? Too far behind in the polls?
The skeptical questions for the more progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, often challenge the substance of their ideas: Are you too radical? Are you being realistic? And, by golly, how would you pay for it all?
I recently took a detailed look through the coverage of the wealth tax, favored by both Sanders and Warren, and centrist bias seeps through much of it. The coverage has slanted negative, filled with the worries that centrists have -- that the tax wouldn't work in practice or would slow economic growth.
Experts who favor a wealth tax, like Gene Sperling, Felicia Wong and Heather Boushey, or whose academic research suggests it would work, like Lily Batchelder and David Kamin, have received less attention than experts who don't like the idea. For that matter, the complaints of obscure billionaires have gotten more attention than the arguments of sympathetic experts. "Billionaire whining about a wealth tax," as Ilyana Kuziemko, a Princeton economist who's sympathetic to a wealth tax told me, mostly isn't newsworthy.
I'm not suggesting that journalists lather the wealth tax with praise. There are real questions about it, and journalists are supposed to be skeptical. I'm also not suggesting that Sanders or Warren is necessarily the best nominee. As regular readers know, I'm a moderate on Medicare, immigration and college debt, among other subjects. John Harris, for his part, confesses to "a pretty strong bout" of centrist bias.
But maybe that's why we recognize it and pine for more objective coverage. Not every policy question posed to Democrats needs to have a conservative assumption, and not every question posed to Republicans needs to have a liberal one. If Warren and Sanders are going to be asked whether their solutions go too far, Joe Biden should be asked whether his solutions are too timid: Mr. Vice President, many economists believe that inequality is bad for an economy, so are you doing enough to attack inequality?
Once you start thinking about centrist bias, you recognize a lot of it. It helps explain why the 2016 presidential debates focused more on the budget deficit, a topic of centrist zealotry, than climate change, almost certainly a bigger threat. (Well-funded deficit advocacy plays a role too.) Centrist bias also helps explain the credulousness of early coverage during the Iraq and Vietnam wars. Both Democrats and Republicans, after all, largely supported each war.
The world is more surprising and complicated than centrist bias imagines it to be. Sometimes, people like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are right. Even when they're not, they deserve the same skepticism that other politicians do -- no less, no more.

Texto completo: Mr. Simon, light of touch yet breathtakingly pyrotechnic, was known for his interpretations of the Romantic literature.
Abbey Simon, an American pianist celebrated for a style that harked back to an earlier, golden age of keyboard prowess, died on Wednesday at his home in Geneva. He was 99.
His death was announced by his son, Jonathan.
Mr. Simon, who had appeared on concert stages around the world since the early 1940s, was often called a pianist's pianist -- greatly admired by musicians and critics if not strictly a household name. Known in particular for his interpretations of the Romantic literature, he was lauded for the fleetness of his fingers, the lightness of his tone and the thoughtfulness of his interpretations.
"Poetry, musicianship and technique have characterized Abbey Simon's piano playing since his debut nine years ago," Ross Parmenter wrote in The New York Times in 1949, reviewing a concert by Mr. Simon of Bach, Brahms, Chopin and Ravel. "On the basis of his recital last night at Carnegie Hall, one would add a fourth attribute, mastery."
Although some critics faulted Mr. Simon's playing for being overly cerebral, most concurred that in his pianism and choice of repertoire he recalled late-19th and early-20th-century virtuosos like Josef Hofmann, who had been his teacher. The style of both men was breathtakingly pyrotechnic yet no less sensitive for it -- in stark contrast to the more bombastic approach that came to be regarded as a hallmark of many younger pianists.
"I am in essence a 19th-century artist," Mr. Simon told the music journalist Bruce Duffie in 1988. "I play a great deal of Prokofiev; I play Sam Barber, but they're '19th-century' composers. They are virtuoso composers; they are melodic composers; they are fascinating in their harmonies and their orchestration. But the way present-day composers use the piano, it's just not for me."
Mr. Simon was widely heard on recordings; as a soloist with orchestras including the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra; and, in particular, on recital stages, including those of Carnegie and Town Halls in New York.
"I was brought up in the great tradition of the piano recital," he told The Times in 1981. "Playing with an orchestra is an exciting experience, it's a chance to make an impression and all that. But when all is said and done, we're going to judge the artist not on the Rachmaninoff Third, or the Brahms D minor, or Beethoven's 'Emperor,' but on how he plays in recital."
The son of Solomon Simon, a dentist, and the former Vera Sheldin, Abbey Simon was born in New York on Jan. 8, 1920, and reared in the Bronx.
The family, teeming with doctors and dentists, was musical as well as medical: One uncle, besides being a dentist, was a semiprofessional jazz pianist; another, Mr. Simon recalled in a 2013 video interview, was "the Jascha Heifetz of the mandolin."
At 3, Abbey could pick out perfectly on the piano any tune he heard on the radio; he began formal lessons at 5.
"I was a very lucky child, because who knows what they want to be when they are only 3 years old?" Mr. Simon said in a 2014 interview with The Daily Cougar, the campus newspaper of the University of Houston, where he taught for many years. "I had always known I was a pianist."
At 10, he received a scholarship to Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Taking up the scholarship the next year, he moved to Philadelphia with his mother and studied there with Hofmann.
In 1940, Mr. Simon was a winner of the Walter W. Naumburg Foundation competition, a prestigious musical honor that carried a debut recital at Town Hall. After Army service in World War II he resumed his career, touring nationwide. Throughout much of the '40s, he appeared annually in recital at Carnegie Hall.
After the success of his first European tour in 1949, Mr. Simon moved to Europe for more than a decade, living primarily in Switzerland.
"There ought to be a law," Robert Sherman wrote in The Times in 1965, bemoaning the rarity of Mr. Simon's appearances in the United States. "An artist of such technical prowess, exciting temperament and musical sensitivity should be heard again and again."
But Mr. Simon's long sojourn in Europe, whose musical climate appeared more tolerant of inspired imperfection, let him grow as he might not have done otherwise, he said.
"Getting away gave me the possibility of having thoughts of my own, of developing my own personality, a chance to find myself, even the chance to play badly!" he told The Times in 1960, on a rare visit to New York.
"I mean," Mr. Simon elaborated, "the chance to play a piece a certain way to see if it will go, and then to find that it's wrong and must be done in some other fashion. Here, that would be a disaster and one simply can't take the chance. Over there one can be less inhibited musically."
Mr. Simon, who also taught over the years at Indiana University and the Juilliard School, had homes in Houston and Geneva. His wife, the former Dina Levinson, died in 2014. In addition to his son, he is survived by two grandchildren.
If Mr. Simon, as The Times reported in 1988, sometimes bristled at the appellation "pianist's pianist," with its implied, if rarefied, marginalization, he was ultimately sanguine about his professional course.
"I have been busy all of my life," he said. "I have had a fine career. In the meantime, a lot of pianists who made big noises have disappeared. I am still around."
Michael Levenson contributed reporting.

Texto completo: While packing her 7-month-old son's things for a trip to Europe a year and a half ago, Alejandra Tejada became so overwhelmed by the minutiae -from food pouches to infant thermometers - that she forgot to include diaper cream. She also brought too few diapers and in Barcelona had to make an emergency run - for a decidedly notleak-proofbrand.
"When you have a baby, packing takes on a whole other level of responsibility because the well-being of thaţchild falls squarely on you,' said Tejada, who lives in Wellesley, Massachusetts. "It's a lot of anxiety when you worry you might be forgetting something."
Galvanized by this anxiety - and that discouraging diaper run - this past summer she created Totts, which delivers baby and toddler essentials to travel destinations. Totts is one of several new, parent-founded companies seeking to relieve packing stress by espousing DIFM - "do it for me" - solutions, rather than DIY or BYO ones.
Family travel is a $500 billion global industry, according to the Family Travel Association, an industry trade group. In a recent survey of nearly 1,600 parents, the association found that 77% traveled with their children in the past three years; nearly that many will do so in the next three years.
Yet gettinglittle ones ready for vacation remains a constant source of bewilderment. On Facebook groups, at mommy meet-ups and in stores like Ta'get, consumers wonder which travel stroller to purchase, whether to use 640 cubic inches of precious carry-on space for a 33-pack of Pampers - yes, I measured my son's - and what happens when you step off the plane only to realize that you've forgotten baby Tylenol.
"With young kids, extensive thought goes into creating a home-awayfrom-home, which is complicated when that new home is across the world. There's only so much that families can pack and carry," said Amie O'Shaughnessy, chief executive of Ciao Bambino, a family-focused Virtuoso travel agency.
Totts determines what customers need based on the length of their trip and their children's ages. A five-night vacation with а 13-Ю-18month-old, for example, produces an $89 box of two-dozen drugstore-aisle staples, all apportioned to be used while traveling, including 36 diapers and disposable bibs. Add-ons include swim diapers and Babyganics insect repellent. Boxes are advance-shipped to hotels and vacation rentals around the United States (for now).
Another company, KeepEmQuiet, founded in 2016, curates age-appropriate toys and snacks in an effort to, well, keep 'em quiet on planes, trains and automobiles.
Serving central London, Airtots rents out larger gear like a Babyzen YOYO+ stroller, which retails for about $450 (about $56 for one week, and about $96 for two weeks). Bundles of gear (from about $238 a week), organized by age, include everything from bottle sterilizers to cribs.
Whereas Airtots owns an inventory of nearly 1,000 items, BabyQuip takes a different approach: a geography-based network of parent-to-parent rentals. Families in Brooklyn over Christmas can rent a BOB jogging stroller ($15 a day) and a wood-slatted crib ($18 a day) from a local woman whose avatar shows a photo of herself snuggling with her two children.
BabyQuip has raised more than $2.5 million in seed funding and serves more than 400 cities in the United States and Canada, plus both Disney resorts.
"Most of our providers naturally build their own inventory - say, their kids grow up and they have extra stuff around," said Fran Maier, the Match.com co-founder who founded BabyQuip in 2016. "They're largely moms serving other moms, so they have empathy; they know exactly what families are looking for."
With a few exceptions (like the The Chatwal in New York City, which allows guests to borrow UPPAbaby strollers), many hotels only offer cribs and (perhaps) baby-friendly toiletries. Hotel partnerships - for Airtots, with Ace and several others in London; for BabyQuip, with Destination Hotels in the United States - widen the range.
Vacation rentals might similarly lack supplies. "With the rise of the likes of Airbnb, we saw a growing expectation gap between what guests would like to have provided and what hosts were willing - or even capable - of providing," said Ben Lewis, a father of three, who co-founded Airtots in 2017 with Matt Wood, an uncle of three.
For Jill Monaghan of Edinburgh, Airtots saved a family vacation to London last year by delivering and assembling cribs and high chairs for her children, now 2 and 4, even after an eleventh-hour switcheroo with her apartment rental.
"Knowing there would be clean gear - and knowing that everything would be set up - made my life so much easier," Monaghan said.

Texto completo: The majority of commercial facial-recognition systems exhibit bias, according to a study from a federal agency released Thursday, underscoring questions about a technology increasingly used by police departments and federal agencies to identify suspected criminals.
The systems falsely identified African American and Asian faces 10 times to 100 times more than Caucasian faces, the National Institute of Standards and Technology reported. Among a database of photos used by law enforcement agencies in the United States, the highest error rates came in identifying Native Americans, the study found.
The technology also had more difficulty identifying women than men. And it falsely identified older adults up to 10 times more than middle-aged adults.
The new report comes at a time of mounting concern from lawmakers and civil rights groups over the proliferation of facial recognition. Proponents view it as an important tool for catching criminals and tracking terrorists. Tech companies market it as a convenience that can be used to help identify people in photos or in lieu of a password to unlock smartphones.
Civil liberties experts, however, warn that the technology - which can be used to track people at a distance without their knowledge - has the potential to lead to ubiquitous surveillance, chilling freedom of movement and speech. This year, San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley in California and the Massachusetts communities of Somerville and Brookline banned government use of the technology.
"One false match can lead to missed flights, lengthy interrogations, watch list placements, tense police encounters, false arrests or worse," Jay Stanley, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. "Government agencies including the FBI, Customs and Border Protection and local law enforcement must immediately halt the deployment of this dystopian technology."
The federal report is one of the largest studies of its kind. The researchers had access to more than 18 million photos of about 8.5 million people from American mug shots, visa applications and border-crossing databases.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology tested 189 facial-recognition algorithms from 99 developers, representing the majority of commercial developers. They included systems from Microsoft, biometric technology companies like aaCognitec, and Megvii, an artificial intelligence company in China.
The agency did not test systems from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google because they did not submit their algorithms for the federal study.
The federal report confirms earlier studies from MIT that reported that facial-recognition systems from some large tech companies had much lower accuracy rates in identifying the female and darker-skinned faces than the white male faces.
"While some biometric researchers and vendors have attempted to claim algorithmic bias is not an issue or has been overcome, this study provides a comprehensive rebuttal," Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the MIT Media Lab who led one of the facial studies, said in an email. "We must safeguard the public interest and halt the proliferation of face surveillance."
Although the use of facial recognition by law enforcement is not new, new uses are proliferating with little independent oversight or public scrutiny. China has used the technology to surveil and control ethnic minority groups like the Uighurs. This year, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials came under fire for using the technology to analyze the driver's licenses of millions of people without their knowledge.
Biased facial recognition technology is particular problematic in law enforcement because errors could lead to false accusations and arrests. The new federal study found that the kind of facial matching algorithms used in law enforcement had the highest error rates for African American females.
"The consequences could be significant," said Patrick Grother, a computer scientist at NIST who was the primary author of the new report. He said he hoped it would spur people who develop facial recognition algorithms to "look at the problems they may have and how they might fix it."
But ensuring that these systems are fair is only part of the task, said Maria De-Arteaga, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in algorithmic systems. As facial recognition becomes more powerful, she said, companies and governments must be careful about when, where and how they are deployed.
"We have to think about whether we really want these technologies in our society," she said.

Texto completo: CIUDAD JUÁREZ, Mexico
Temperatures have dropped below freezing here this weekend, but not everyone is sleeping indoors.
Hundreds of Mexican migrants seeking to claim asylum in the United States camp out in makeshift tent cities near international crossings in this border city. Now, as the weather turns colder, local government officials are pleading with them to head to shelters, but most won't budge.
"If we leave here, we'll lose our place in line," said Sandra, a 27-year-old mother of three who said she'll stay put even though her children have gotten sick from living outside. "People who have gone to the shelters have lost their place."
The ever-evolving immigration picture at the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez has morphed once again: Where only a few months ago record numbers of Central American families were arriving here to seek asylum, their presence - and their plight - is now being filled by Mexicans who want to claim asylum in the U.S. to flee drug violence.
The Mexican asylum-seekers are taking a different tack than those leaving other countries, partly because new, restrictive immigration policies the U.S. has used to stem the migrant flow don't apply to them.
Perhaps the biggest contrast is also the most visible one. While other asylum-seekers are spread out across Juárez, taking refuge in shelters or other types of housing, many Mexicans are pitching tents in the open.
At one of the tent cities in Chamizal Federal Public Park, located near the Bridge of the Americas border crossing, makeshift tents dot the landscape, a patchwork of shelters fashioned out of green, blue and black plastic tarps weighed down by rocks and circumscribed by gutters dug in the dirt to keep the rainwater out.
In common areas near the tents, children ride bicycles and kick soccer balls. Parents hang hand-washed laundry between tall trees, families prepare dinner at cooking stations and men stack piles of wood. Many of the migrants wear donated jackets and other clothes to deal with the cold.
Most people camping here are from the violent states of Michoacan, Zacatecas and Guerrero, which are in central and southern Mexico. Many said they decided to make the journey after gangs tried to recruit them and threatened them with death if they didn't join or pay them money.
"They came to our house and told my sister if we weren't back in four hours, they would kill us," said Juan, a 28-year-old from Zacatecas who was carrying his 3-year-old daughter and her doll in his arms while riding a bicycle around the park.
After that, Juan, who didn't give his last name for fear of reprisals, headed north immediately with his wife, sister and children - and he didn't even stop at home to pack a bag.
"We didn't give them time to find us," he said, adding he didn't want to end up like a friend, who had just been killed by gang members.
Juan said he at first had considered paying a smuggler to get him and his family across the border, but then an uncle in the U.S. had told him they could walk across and claim asylum.
"I have hope that they'll accept us," he said.
Since March, migrants who claim asylum have been sent back to Mexico to wait for their court dates under a U.S. policy called the Migrant Protection Protocols. But under the policy and consistent with the 1951 Refugee Convention, a United Nations treaty, Mexican asylum-seekers aren't subject to the measures because they can't be sent back to the very country where they claim they're being persecuted.
"If they do come across the border, they're by definition seeking asylum from Mexico, so they have to be able to wait in the U.S.," said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.
Another new Trump administration policy, which disallows claims from people who failed to claim asylum in other countries en route to the U.S., doesn't apply to Mexicans, either.
The U.S. has responded by starting pilot programs in El Paso that speed up the adjudications of Mexican asylum-seekers and put them on a fast track to deportation if their cases are denied. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit earlier this month, arguing the programs don't allow immigrants access to adequate legal counsel.
Mexican asylum-seekers waiting in Juárez have created their own separate system of "metering" - essentially, a waiting list used to limit the number of people allowed to apply for asylum at U.S. ports of entry.
The main "metering" system used by most migrants - from Central Americans to Cubans to Africans - is implemented by Chihuahua's State Population Council. But Mexican officials said both they and U.S. authorities have agreed that people claiming persecution in Mexico shouldn't use a list maintained by that same country.
And that's the list the migrants believe they'll lose their place on if they pack up their tents to head to a shelter.
In the past week, as freezing temperatures started to show up in the weather forecast, officials from Chihuahua have tried to move people in the tent cities to migrant shelters, especially since 48 percent of them are underage. But they haven't had much success.
"We're suggesting it for the well-being of the children," said Enrique Valenzuela, director of the State Population Council, which runs Chihuahua's migrant transition facility. "As much as we insist, they don't want to move. There have been very few who have gone to the shelter."
Temperatures in Juarez fell to
30 degrees early Friday and lows
were expected to hit that level Saturday and Sunday as well.
It's unclear why the number of Mexican asylum-seekers has recently increased. It could be because violence has increased in areas of southern Mexico. Worldwide media attention on Central American migrants passing through their country to seek asylum also may have encouraged Mexicans to head north. Smugglers could also be responding to the decreasing number of Central American migrants by selling their services to more Mexicans.
In August, Mexico overtook Guatemala and Honduras to become the largest source of unauthorized migration to the U.S. In October, the number of Mexicans apprehended at ports of entry rose to around 17,000, a 34 percent increase from July, the New York Times reported.
The waiting process at the tent cities is an intricate system. For starters, it's not just one list - there are separate registers for people from Michoacan, Zacatecas and Guerrero.
Every morning at 11, people designated to oversee the waiting lists carry out a roll call of sorts and everyone on the list needs to be present. If someone is absent three times, they get kicked off the list.
As people get closer to the top of the list, they move to a small area known as "the triangle," located on the main avenue, kitty-corner from the edge of the park and closer to the bridge that traverses the Rio Grande into the U.S.
That's where Dulce Maria, who also declined to give her last name out of fear of reprisals, was camped out with her husband and two sons. She said that three months ago, they heard on news reports back home that the U.S. was granting asylum to Mexicans who had been the victims of drug violence, so they packed up their things and headed for Juárez.
"We got here and there were all these people," she said. "They must have seen it on the news before we did."
Dulce Maria said people who were ahead of her family on the list and had already crossed told her by phone that they had entered the U.S. successfully and were now waiting with their families on the other side.
The cold isn't the only potential threat at the park. Some of the men in the camps said they take turns guarding the area at night to help ensure their families stay safe.
Some people reported "suspicious" people lingering nearby at night, and several said one woman from the camps had been kidnapped, although this couldn't be corroborated by any public officials.
"Thank God nothing has happened to us," said Juan, the 28-year-old migrant from Zacatecas.
Some people were reluctant to give even their first names, afraid that any photo posted on social media could alert the gangs from which they were fleeing.
Others, such as Baltazar Gonzalez, a 21-year-old from Michoacan, didn't have a problem with giving his name. Kicking a soccer ball to himself in the park, he said a gang beat him and threatened to kill him back home.
"I'm renouncing Mexico," he said. "My biggest dream is to get to the U.S., to get away from the insecurity."

Texto completo: After working nights and weekends in an attempt to throw President Trump out of office before the voters can re-elect him, House Democrats declined to send their two articles of impeachment over to the Senate. Instead, they recessed for the holidays and left town.
It looks like everybody got something out of it. Nancy Pelosi got a growling rebuke of the president to satisfy her far-left squad and calm the terrified incumbents who live in fear of a primary challenge from a squad wannabe in their own districts. Adam Schiff got the cover of Los Angeles magazine. And President Trump received a most unlikely Christmas present, Republican unity. He’ll also unwrap fundraising totals for the fourth quarter that will be higher than Trump Tower.
The week featured a lot of thundering about history, and a lot of wailing over what some people think is the unprecedented polarization in our country.
It’s not unprecedented. Drop by the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda and walk through exhibits that bring to life the bitter divisions during the Vietnam War. There you can see a real impeachment inquiry, in a National Archives curated gallery that chronicles the events known as Watergate.
On display is a photograph of a page in an address book. It was the first hint of what would come from the 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington.
The address book belonged to one of the Watergate burglars. On the page marked “H” was the phone number of E. Howard Hunt’s White House office. But why?
The answer would eventually lead to a House Judiciary Committee vote to recommend three articles of impeachment, and to Nixon’s resignation. It’s often said that the cover-up was worse than the crime. You should see what Nixon was covering up.
In May 1971, the White House planned a “dirty tricks” operation. With Nixon’s knowledge, aides hired Donald Segretti to recruit operatives to disrupt Democratic rallies, forge letters on Democratic campaign stationery, and infiltrate rival campaigns with spies. In December 1971, Nixon authorized a phony “write-in” campaign for Sen. Ted Kennedy in the New Hampshire primary, to try to pull votes away from then-frontrunner Sen. Ed Muskie.
These operations were already underway when a former Pentagon analyst named Daniel Ellsberg, who had come to oppose the Vietnam War, leaked a classified study of America’s involvement in Vietnam. The Pentagon Papers were published in the New York Times in June 1971.
Nixon believed he was facing a conspiracy by holdovers from the previous administration who were trying to sabotage his Vietnam policy. He ordered a top aide to have the Internal Revenue Service launch special audits of “political enemies” on a list. The IRS Commissioner and the Treasury Secretary refused to launch the audits, but the attempt was later cited by the House Judiciary Committee.
The House also noted Nixon’s July 1971 order for an investigation into civil servants at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, when he thought they were intentionally misrepresenting monthly unemployment figures and demanded to know how many Jews worked in the unit. That was in the articles of impeachment, too.
In August 1971, the White House asked the FBI to find dirt on CBS News correspondent Daniel Schorr, but the bureau mistakenly thought the president wanted to appoint Schorr to a federal job and conducted a background-check interview. When Schorr complained, the White House put him on the list for IRS harassment, and the House later put that in the second article of impeachment.
In September 1971, the White House “Plumbers” (plumbers stop leaks) broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg’s former psychiatrist to try to find the confidential notes he had refused to give the FBI.
In early 1972, G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt pitched a plan to Attorney General John Mitchell for a $1 million program of counterdemonstrations, bugging and break-ins at the headquarters of the eventual Democratic nominee for president, the convention hotel in Miami, and the DNC headquarters at the Watergate in Washington, D.C. Mitchell told the finance chair of the Nixon re-election campaign to give them $250,000.
The Watergate burglars were caught in June 1972. When the FBI began to trace the money found in the burglars’ hotel rooms, President Nixon ordered the CIA to mislead the FBI into thinking the Watergate break-in was a CIA operation. Hush money was paid to the burglars from the White House’s secret $350,000 political fund.
In November 1972, Nixon won re-election in a landslide, carrying 49 states and 60.7% of the popular vote. But slowly the cover-up was unraveling. Judge John J. Sirica was overseeing a grand jury investigation, the CIA decided to tell the FBI that the burglary wasn’t their operation, Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein reported doggedly on the story, and by early 1973, some of the conspirators were cooperating with prosecutors.
There were guilty pleas and convictions in the first trial, and the Senate voted unanimously to form a Select Committee on Watergate. Nixon passed up a chance to end the cover-up and decided that finding a million dollars in hush money for E. Howard Hunt was the better choice.
White House firings, resignations and denials followed. In May 1973, Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox was hired, and in October, Nixon ordered his firing. The attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned.
In March 1974, Judge Sirica handed over the grand jury materials to the House of Representatives, and in July the Judiciary Committee voted to recommend three articles of impeachment. In August, the public got the first look at transcripts of Oval Office tapes that Nixon had tried to keep secret. The nation learned that Nixon had ordered the CIA to obstruct the FBI’s investigation. Support for the president collapsed. He resigned on August 9, 1974.
A walk through the Watergate gallery at the Nixon Library shows the hazards of abusing the powers of the CIA, FBI and IRS to go after political enemies. But it’s not Trump who did that.
After a number of investigations, we have learned that during the Obama administration, the IRS targeted conservative groups and the FBI misled the FISA court to get authorization to wiretap a Trump adviser. The CIA’s actions are currently under investigation by special prosecutor John Durham.
One day, history will judge the House of Representatives’ vote to impeach President Trump. Maybe we’ll find out that the House’s aim was off by one president.

Texto completo: Does the road to the White House run through a wine cave?
That was the question that electrified the Democratic debate in Los Angeles on Thursday. It was specific, referring to the location of a recent fundraiser that Pete Buttigieg had held in Napa Valley.
But it was also metaphoric, a stand-in for the wider argument among Democrats over pragmatism versus purity, compromise versus idealism, a candidate like Buttigieg or Joe Biden versus a candidate like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders.
As Warren blasted Buttigieg for kissing up to wealthy donors — and he portrayed her as an unpractical hypocrite — they weren’t really sparring over cabernet and cash. They were promoting separate strategies for winning the presidential election, different ways to position their party and vanquish Donald Trump.
It was the same conflict that has defined the Democratic primary from the start, but with extra fury. Passions often burn hotter when alcohol is involved.
“Billionaires in wine caves should not pick the next president of the United States,” Warren said, exploding the relative politeness of the debate to that point.
Buttigieg was ready for this, noting that she’s actually a millionaire — several times over — and he’s not. “Senator, your net worth is 100 times mine,” he said. So if she donated the legal maximum of $2,800 to him, he asked, “Would that pollute my campaign because it came from a wealthy person? No. I would be glad to have that support. We need the support of everybody who is committed to helping us to defeat Donald Trump.”
“I do not sell access to my time,” she shot back.
“As of when, Senator?” he said, pointing out that she began her presidential bid with financial reserves from a Senate race in which she had indeed held the “big-ticket fundraisers you now denounce. Did it corrupt you, Senator? Of course not.”
They both had solid points. They both articulated them forcefully. In fact, they were both terrific, although less so during that exchange than during other stretches of the evening, as they made utterly clear why they are firmly ensconced, along with Biden and Sanders, in the top four.
That’s the hell of this primary: There’s talent galore. But with each talented candidate comes serious shortcomings, and there’s just no clear answer to which of them — including Amy Klobuchar, who had an excellent evening and grows more and more appealing — would be Trump’s fiercest adversary.
The president was a bigger presence at this sixth Democratic primary debate than at the previous five, and that was inevitable. Just 24 hours before it began, he became the third president in American history to be impeached, a reflection of just how unfit for office almost all Democrats rightly deem him to be.
But impeaching him won’t get rid of him; for that, beating him in November 2020 is necessary. So the debate was all about which candidate would ensure that, as all seven of those who appeared onstage gave their pitches.
Tom Steyer, a billionaire, noted that Trump would run on his economic record of low unemployment figures and a bullish stock market, so his opponent should be someone who could poke the right holes in that. Someone with irrefutable business acumen. Someone like, well, Tom Steyer.
Klobuchar, who represents Minnesota in the Senate, noted that the Midwest was crucial to Trump’s election, so his opponent should be someone with the proven ability to win votes there. Someone from the Midwest. Someone like, well, Amy Klobuchar.
Biden, the former vice president, stressed the importance of a leader with the experience to begin effective repair work and restore America’s leadership in the world right away. He also emphasized the need to at least take a stab at bipartisanship and did so in a fashion more heartfelt and gripping than ever.
“I refuse to accept the notion, as some on this stage do, that we can never, never get to a place where we have cooperation again,” he said. “If that’s the case, we are dead as a country. We need to be able to reach a consensus. And if anyone has reason to be angry with the Republicans and not want to cooperate, it’s me — the way they’ve attacked me, my son and my family.”
Buttigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of a small Indiana city, asserted anew that a fresh perspective from outside Washington was the answer.
This prompted the evening’s second most fiery exchange, between him and Klobuchar — who is in her third term in the Senate.
“When we were in the last debate, Mayor, you basically mocked the hundred years of experience on the stage,” Klobuchar said to him. “And I have not denigrated your experience as a local official.”
“You actually did,” he responded. “I was going to let it go, because we have bigger fish to fry here.”
“Oh,” she said, “I don’t think we have bigger fish to fry than picking a president of the United States.”
They proceeded to joust over whether he’d won tough elections, with him bringing up his challenges as a gay man. It was riveting and raw and a sign of how close the Iowa caucuses are drawing, how nervous Democrats are about finding the path to the end of Trump, how urgent all of this feels.
Warren leaned on “corruption” as hard as she’d leaned on “fight” during prior debates, insisting that corruption’s most ardent enemy would be Trump’s scariest foe. She also had the best line of the night, delivered when the candidates were being asked about recent remarks by President Barack Obama that took issue with how male, old or both many of the Democrats vying for the White House were.
“Senator Warren, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated,” one of the moderators, Tim Alberta of Politico, said. She’s 70 now.
“I’d also be the youngest woman ever inaugurated,” Warren answered.
The second best line was Andrew Yang’s. Speaking up for more women in government, he said, “If you get too many men alone and leave us alone for a while, we kind of become morons.” But he added that the excessive importance of money in politics was a bar to female candidates, who aren’t poised “to go shake the money tree in the wine cave.”
His wit and Warren’s deftness were no surprise. Biden’s brio and confidence were.
He didn’t have the best debate of the night, because he can’t. Biden speaks not in straight lines but in wide swerves: If he were a car, his tires would constantly scrape the curb and his hubcaps would probably pop off.
But they stayed on this time, and he steered clear of danger, by which I mean the wine cave, acknowledging his own rich donors without investing himself in the kind of defense that Buttigieg was compelled to mount.
And in his zigging and zagging way, Biden recognized that what divides the race’s progressives from its moderates isn’t values but the candidates’ assessments of what can safely be promised and reasonably achieved.
I’ll drink to that. And in honor of “Joe Sixpack,” I’ll make it a beer.

Impeachment's sound and fury leaves voters largely unmoved By Michael Graham

Texto completo: The New York Times headline reads, "A President Impeached, and a Nation Convulsed."
But if you're looking for evidence of a political convulsion - on either side of the aisle - you'll need a microscope. The most newsworthy aspect of the "historic" impeachment of President Donald Trump may be how little effect the "historic" event has had on American politics.
Supporters of Trump have repeatedly pointed to the fact that Democrats have been urging Trump's impeachment since he took office - and they're right. An anti-Trump website, ImpeachDonaldTrumpNow.org, launched literally on Inauguration Day 2017. ("From the moment he assumed the office, President Trump has been in direct violation of the US Constitution," the website reads.)
As Majority Leader Mitch McConnell noted on the Senate floor Thursday, Wednesday's vote to impeach Trump wasn't the Democrats' first. It was their seventh. It's just the first time they had a majority of members in support.
This impeachment vote was "the predetermined end of a partisan crusade that began before President Trump was even sworn in," McConnell said.
There are more interesting data from early 2017: Trump's approval numbers. According to the data-crunchers at FiveThirtyEight, Trump's approval average on impeachment day was identical to his support on March 16, 2017: 43.5 percent.
Three years of Russia investigations, 12 weeks of impeachment inquiry, hundreds of hours of speeches by politicians and mountains of negative media coverage, and the president's standing with the voters is where it was back when he first took office. If the Democrats' goal was to "find a way to bring Trump down" - and 59% of Americans believe it is, according to a Monmouth poll - they failed.
But that doesn't mean Trump should be popping the champagne corks, either. "It doesn't really feel like we're being impeached," Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Wednesday night as the votes were being cast. "I don't know about you, but I'm having a good time."
Perhaps. But a president who can't get his approval rating above 45% still has plenty to worry about. While it's true that a recent Suffolk poll found Trump beating all the Democratic front-runners in head-to-head match-ups, it's also true that Trump trails former vice president Joe Biden by about 5 points in the RealClearPolitics average, and loses to Biden in 47 out of the last 50 polls.
Yes, Trump's approval has risen a bit - a "six-point surge" as his campaign calls it - since the impeachment inquiry, and yes, most Americans believe the Democrats are motivated by partisanship, not patriotism. But those same polls show most Americans think Trump did something wrong and deserved to be investigated, if not punished.
In fact, as bad as Congress' poll numbers are (25% approve, 54% disapprove), they've also risen a bit since the impeachment inquiry began, as has Speaker Nancy Pelosi's approval rating (39% approve, 49% disapprove).
Just days before the impeachment vote, Pelosi told The New York Times, "My numbers are better than Trump's. So if I'm not doing well, he's doing worse."
What's actually happening, based on the polling data, is that both politicians are getting higher and more intense support for their bases, while moderate, independent and less-engaged voters are shrugging off the whole impeachment fight.
"I was out talking to customers and vendors all day Wednesday, and you know how many mentioned impeachment to me? None," Randall Bloomquist, a small-business owner in the liberal-leaning Atlanta suburb of Decatur, Ga., told InsideSources. "It was all over the media, but not on the minds of my customers."
According to the latest Suffolk poll, just 33% of independent voters support impeachment, while 46% oppose. And in a new Quinnipiac poll, only 28% of independents approve of how Congress is doing its job.
And while politicians and the press have talked nonstop about impeachment for months, when Suffolk asked voters to pick their priorities from a list of 12 issues, impeaching Trump came in next to last at 19% - well behind the economy (53 percent), health care (48 percent) and immigration (40 percent).
Which is why many Americans simply tuned out. The week before the impeachment vote, more people watched a single episode of CBS's "Magnum, P.I." reboot than tuned into primetime programming on all three cable news networks combined.
"Why bother? They were always going to impeach him," says Paul Norell, a sales executive and Trump supporter in Dallas. "The Senate's not going to throw him out of office, right? So what do I care?"
The net result of the over-hyped impeachment battle is that 40% of the country loves Trump, about 45% hate him, and the 2020 election will be won by whichever side does the best job of both motivating its base and bringing along the last 5% of persuadable voters.
Which is why the biggest news of the week may actually be Pelosi's threat to stretch out the (seemingly unending) process by refusing to send over the articles of impeachment for a Senate trial.
After years of investigations, charges and debates, the only thing the typical American voter hates more than impeachment are the words "more impeachment."

Congress extends tax relief for distilleries, breweries

Texto completo: Congress this week included a one-year extension of the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act for the bourbon and beer industry in the 2020 government-funding bill that it sent to President Donald Trump on Thursday.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that in addition to preserving a federal excise tax reduction for more than 2,000 distillers and breweries, the bill extended his Advancing Growth in the Economy through Distilled Spirits Act, which provides "fairness for bourbon producers by allowing them to deduct interest expense in the year it is paid, rather than at the end of the bourbon-aging process."
The New York Times reported that the legislation reduced the amount that all distilleries pay on the first 100,000 proof gallons from $13.50 to $2.70.
Without the extension, the story said, "most alcoholic-beverage producers would have seen their excise taxes rise 400 percent starting Jan. 1, with the first payment due, in many cases, just two weeks later."
Some distilleries were miffed that the extension was only for one year.
But McConnell said in a news release that "this tax relief supports thousands of good jobs in communities across the Bluegrass State."
See Bourbon/Page A2
He said, "My AGED Spirits Act is a pro-growth measure that puts Kentucky's signature spirit on a level playing field with its competitors at home and abroad."
Eric Gregory, president of the Kentucky Distillers' Association, said in a news release that the organization is grateful to McConnell for getting the legislation extended for another year.
"These measures are vitally important in continuing Kentucky bourbon's historic renaissance, which is pouring more than $8.6 billion into the commonwealth's economy each year, and is responsible for 20,100 jobs, $1 billion in payroll and $2.3 billion in capital investment," he said.
A spokeswoman for O.Z. Tyler Distillery in Owensboro said Gregory's comments reflect the distillery's position.

She might as well have been writing about the recent mess at the Hallmark Channel, which in the past two months zigzagged from promises to be more inclusive of LGBTQ families on its TV channel (there are none currently), to yanking four commercials featuring two brides (calling them "controversial"), to completely reversing course this weekend and apologizing to Zola, the wedding planner company that had produced the ads. The president and CEO of Hallmark Cards, Inc., said the earlier action to ban the ads featuring lesbian brides "was the wrong decision."
Good for Hallmark. Good for viewers.
I confess: One of my guilty pleasures is watching the Hallmark Channel's Christmas movies, especially the royal fantasia "Crown for Christmas." Schmaltzy? Check. Unrealistic? Of course. Inclusive? Hardly. The lack of representation of queer people has been only one part of the Hallmark Channel's failed diversity efforts, which unfailingly presents "white Christmas" storylines, which is to say very few African Americans or other people of color in starring roles.
As an example, take the two-dozen holiday movies that Hallmark is debuting this month as part of its annual "Countdown to Christmas." "None center on a same-sex couple or feature LGBTQ characters," reported LGBTQ news website The Advocate. That failure to represent queer couples and families appeared to be coming to an end when the CEO of Crown Media Family Networks, the Hallmark Channel's parent company, told The Hollywood Reporter in November they are "open" to any type of movie, including with gay leading characters.
After all, it's nearly 2020. There are more than half a million same-sex married couples in the U.S., now that gay marriage is legal in every state.
Not coincidentally, before the Zola ads were pulled, the advocacy group One Million Moms, which is a part of the religiously conservative American Family Association and defines part of its mission as the "fight against indecency," hosted a petition on its site that urged Hallmark to "reconsider airing commercials with same-sex couples, and please do not add LGBT movies to the Hallmark Channel. Such content goes against Christian and conservative values that are important to your primary audience. You will lose viewers if you cave to the LGBT agenda."
(As of Monday, the petition had only 30,000 names, while One Million Moms has about 97,500 "likes" on Facebook.)
A Hallmark Channel spokesman told the New York Times that the brides' "public displays of affection" — a typical lips-together smooch — were in violation of its policies. Well, that PDA policy wasn't uniformly applied, since the channel had approved two Zola commercials and, in one of them, the heterosexual couple kissed, too.
Do LGBTQ people still need to make the argument that we are families, too? That we are part of the fabric of American life, even as the Trump administration erases equal protections for members of our community? A Zola spokesman nailed it when he said, "All kisses, couples and marriages are equal celebrations of love."
Zola was joined by an outpouring of support from the LGBTQ community and celebrities, with the Twitter hashtags #BoycottHallmark trending at one point over the weekend.
Finally, on Sunday, Hallmark Cards, Inc., did the right thing, with its president and CEO saying the network would reinstate the Zola ads and stand up for diversity.
Thank you, Hallmark.
Meanwhile, the One Million Moms website lists a number of active campaigns critical of the supposed "LGBTQ agenda." Sure, you can try to erase us everywhere. But don't forget: We are here. We get married. And for now we'll watch sappy Christmas movies on Netflix and, yes, Hallmark.

Texto completo: Officials took the unusual step of distributing his photo, asking the public for help in finding him.
Nine days after a Barnard student was killed during a mugging in a park, New York City police on Friday were carrying out an extensive manhunt for a 14-year-old boy who detectives believed may have been the one who stabbed her with a knife.
"We are working tirelessly," the New York Police Department's chief of detectives, Rodney Harrison, said at a news conference. "We are looking for one more individual and the investigation is still ongoing."
The police said the 14-year-old had been identified by another boy involved in the robbery as the one who delivered fatal stab blows to Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old freshman at Barnard College.
Ms. Majors, a musician and aspiring journalist who had just moved to New York this year for college, was passing through Morningside Park on the way home when she was attacked by at least three young teenagers, the police said. Her killing stunned the city and evoked a bygone era when violent robberies and murders were commonplace.
On Friday night, in an unusual move, the police distributed a photo of the wanted teenager on social media and asked the public for help in finding him. Minutes later, an official police Twitter account said the teenager was wanted in connection with the stabbing in Morningside Park.
The New York Times generally does not publish photos of minors accused of crimes.
The distribution of the photograph was a measure of the difficulty investigators have faced in locating the teenager, whom they identified early on in the investigation but whose whereabouts is still a mystery.
"First and foremost what we want is to bring closure to this case, appropriately, working together hand in hand with the prosecutors," Dermot F. Shea, the police commissioner, said on Friday, when asked whether any progress had been made in the investigation.
Detectives have arrested a 13-year-old boy, who they have said gave statements implicating himself in the crime. He remains in custody and faces a murder charge for his role in the attack. Police questioned and released a different 14-year-old boy last week.
From the start, it was clear to police commanders that the murder of Ms. Majors was the sort of heinous crime that demanded an all-out response from the department. The police commissioner and chief of detectives visited the scene the first night, and the department has poured detectives from other units into the investigation.
One reason for the massive response was that the crime evoked another horrific attack in Central Park in April 1989, when a female jogger was raped and brutally assaulted. In that case, five teenagers -- known as the Central Park Five -- were wrongfully convicted based on false confessions, and the fallout has rippled through the criminal justice system.
In the Majors case, police officials have said they have been careful to question teenage suspects in the presence of their guardians or their lawyers. The interviews have also been videotaped.
But the Legal Aid Society, which is representing the 13-year-old, has said that he was subjected to an aggressive interrogation, including screaming and browbeating by officers, one of whom was armed.
"A parent is not a substitute for an attorney, as parents are often misled, misinformed, kept in the dark, and intimidated by the deceptive and coercive tactics from law enforcement," a spokesman for Legal Aid said in a statement.
The 13-year-old who was arrested last week told detectives that he and two middle school classmates went to the park on the evening of Dec. 11 determined to rob people, the police said. Initially, the teens followed a man walking on some steps, but the boys soon abandoned their plan to mug him.
A few minutes before 7 p.m. the trio spotted Ms. Majors, a young woman with dyed green hair and wearing a purple jacket.
During the videotaped interview, the 13-year-old told police he was two steps behind when his two friends approached Ms. Major, according to testimony from Detective Wilfredo Acevedo during a detention hearing last week.
One of his friends dropped a red-handled knife, and the 13-year-old told the police that he picked the blade up and handed it back, according to the detective's testimony.
The 13-year-old told the police that his two friends grabbed Ms. Majors from behind. She refused to hand over her belongings and screamed for help. She also bit the finger of one of the boys during the struggle, the police said.
That was when the boy who is now being sought is said to have stabbed Ms. Majors so forcibly that feathers flew out of her winter coat, according to the account the 13-year-old gave to detectives.
After the murder, investigators said a grainy surveillance video showed the boys running from the park toward 116th Street. In the next few hours, investigators said, the video helped them trace the boys to their homes.
The 13-year-old, however, was not at home. He was taken into custody on Dec. 12 when a patrol officer spotted him on the street and recognized him from surveillance video.
The next day, investigators questioned the second 14-year-old accompanied by his mother and a lawyer, but he was released after he stopped cooperating, law enforcement officials said.
But the other 14-year-old went missing and, though the police have talked to his mother, he has yet to be interviewed, officials said.

Texto completo: A reader finds that the criticism of a lack of diversity on the debate stage on Thursday ignores the real picture. Also: Gretchen Carlson's nondisclosure agreement at Fox.
To the Editor:
Re "December Democratic Debate: A Smaller, Whiter Stage" (nytimes.com, Dec. 19):
Amid all the commentary about a lack of diversity on the debate stage, can we have a little perspective? Sure, it would have been better if Cory Booker and Julián Castro had been included, but still, out of seven candidates, two are women, one is openly gay and another is Asian-American.
Judging from the Republican congressional caucus, what would we have seen in a comparable G.O.P. debate? Seven straight white men in gray suits?

To the Editor:
Re "Fox News, I Want My Voice Back," by Gretchen Carlson (Op-Ed, Dec. 13):
Ms. Carlson should simply take her voice back.
For all the reasons she argues against nondisclosure agreements in the context of sexual harassment or assault, I would argue that NDAs are "against public policy" and "conscience shocking," two legal criteria for declaring contract provisions void, and unenforceable by the courts.
So say whatever you want, Gretchen. Yes, Fox may sue you, but significant odds are that it will lose. Signing an NDA under these circumstances is inherently coerced.

Texto completo: An investigation concluded that the Treasury Department's top spokeswoman did not commit research misconduct, but required extensive revisions.
WASHINGTON -- Monica Crowley, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for public affairs, committed "localized instances of plagiarism" in her 2000 Ph.D. dissertation, Columbia University found in an investigation that ultimately concluded she did not commit research misconduct.
As part of the university's review of Ms. Crowley's work, she was required to make extensive revisions to her dissertation, a 493-page study of how American policy toward China evolved under Presidents Harry S. Truman and Richard M. Nixon. The research misconduct investigation, which concluded this month, was started after plagiarism accusations were raised about her work in 2017 after her appointment by Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect, for a senior National Security Council job.
"The investigation identified localized instances of plagiarism, but concluded that the preponderance of the evidence did not support a finding that Dr. Crowley committed research misconduct," the university said.
Ms. Crowley, a former Fox News contributor and prominent conservative pundit, has served as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's top spokeswoman since July.
"I am delighted that they have concluded that there was no research misconduct, as I have maintained all along," Ms. Crowley said. "I was also happy to address any inadvertent and honest errors and update the work." She added, "I am extremely proud of the dissertation, particularly given the fresh timeliness of its subject -- the U.S.-China relationship -- and hope that others will read and appreciate it."
Columbia University's statement about its findings was appended to the top of a 27-page "errata sheet" that was added this month as a supplemental file to Ms. Crowley's dissertation. The supplemental file includes 32 revised passages that contained plagiarism or other citation deficiencies that required correction. Two books and two articles were added to the bibliography.
Questions about Ms. Crowley's writing surfaced in 2017 when Politico Magazine published an investigation that found about a dozen examples of plagiarism, including paragraphs that were essentially copied from other scholarly works, heavy paraphrasing and a failure to properly cite or attribute other research.
A Columbia spokesman said the university created a small faculty committee in 2017 to decide whether the accusations were serious enough to warrant a full investigation. After it was determined that was needed, a separate committee considered the accusations and presented its findings and a recommendation to Columbia's Standing Committee on the Conduct of Research. That committee then made a recommendation to the provost.
In cases of academic fraud, Columbia could revoke a degree entirely or ask a student to revise his or her work. In the case of Ms. Crowley, who received her doctorate in international relations, the university required the revisions to be appended to the dissertation as a way of demonstrating the seriousness of the problems.
The questions in 2017 about Ms. Crowley's dissertation coincided with a CNN report that found about 50 examples of plagiarism in Ms. Crowley's 2012 book, "What The (Bleep) Just Happened," which was a critique of the Obama presidency. At the time, HarperCollins, which published the book through its conservative imprint Broadside Books, withdrew the digital edition from retailers. Last year, the publisher returned an updated version it to the market after Ms. Crowley "addressed a number of inadvertent textual errors."
After the controversy, Ms. Crowley withdrew from the National Security Council role, which would have involved speechwriting. She did not address the plagiarism accusations at the time, but in a 2017 appearance on Fox News, she told Sean Hannity that they were a "despicable, straight-up political hit job." She also said that the claims had been "debunked."
Ms. Crowley, an early supporter of Mr. Trump, joined the Treasury Department in the spring as a senior adviser in public affairs after Mr. Mnuchin's spokesman at the time, Tony Sayegh, announced in April that he would leave over the summer. She was brought on as part of a broader effort to bolster the Trump administration's messaging on the economy going into the 2020 presidential campaign.
The position did not require Senate confirmation. However, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, released a statement when Ms. Crowley's appointment to be the Treasury Department's top communications official was announced in July. He argued that evidence of plagiarism should have been disqualifying for a senior government official.
Mr. Wyden's office also sent a letter to Columbia University to inquire about the status of Ms. Crowley's degree.
"Plagiarism is a serious offense that may result in expulsion from college, but is not even a red flag for the Trump administration," Mr. Wyden said. "Credibility should be nonnegotiable in Ms. Crowley's position."
Plagiarism at times has been a disqualifying offense in politics. In 2014, John E. Walsh, then a Democratic senator from Montana, withdrew from an election after The New York Times reported that he plagiarized large sections of a paper he needed to graduate from the Army War College, which later revoked his master's degree.
In 1987, then-Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. withdrew from a race for the Democratic presidential nomination after it came to light that he had lifted portions of other people's speeches without attribution and plagiarized part of a law review article for a paper in law school.
More recently, episodes of plagiarism have been overlooked. In 2016, speechwriters for Melania Trump, Mr. Trump's wife, were caught having used passages that appeared to come from speech by Michelle Obama, the first lady at the time, after Mrs. Trump delivered an address at the Republican National Convention. Despite a brief uproar, the controversy quickly blew over.
And Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, once lost a job at an advertising agency after she was accused of plagiarizing information for a presentation, The Times reported in August.
Ms. Crowley has generally been seen as a positive presence at the Treasury Department. Since assuming the job, she has expanded the department's communications team, updated its presence on social media and encouraged Mr. Mnuchin to participate in more interviews and briefings at a variety of forums.

Trump Balks At Expediting Ukraine Aid In Budget Bill

Texto completo: Had the language not been removed, administration officials threatened that President Trump would veto must-pass spending legislation, prompting another government shutdown.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump's advisers rejected a bid to force his administration to quickly release military assistance for Ukraine early next year, threatening in recent weeks that he would veto must-pass spending legislation if Congress did not remove the directive.
According to three officials familiar with the discussions, Democrats ultimately agreed to drop the language, which would have forced the administration to release $ 250 million in defense aid to Ukraine within 45 days of enactment of the spending package, in order to avoid a government shutdown. Mr. Trump signed the $ 1.4 trillion in spending legislation late Friday, hours after signing a critical defense policy bill while at Joint Base Andrews to leave for his holiday break at his Florida estate.
The discussion in the final days of negotiations over a dozen spending bills, first reported by The Washington Post, came after the administration's decision to withhold Ukraine military assistance became a central issue in the inquiry that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment this week for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The officials who described the discussions did so on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.
A House Intelligence Committee investigation concluded, based on extensive evidence and sworn testimony from administration officials, that Mr. Trump had frozen nearly $ 400 million in security assistance that Congress had allocated for Ukraine this year, using it as leverage in his quest to get the country's president to announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.
Lawmakers in both parties had expressed concerns about the decision to withhold this year's money, and Democrats had proposed new language so that funds could not be withheld in the future.
Had the language been kept in the spending package, the budget office would have had to release the funds for a defense program, the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, within 45 days after the measure became law. The Pentagon would then be allowed to spend the money.
But Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Eric Ueland, the White House director of legislative affairs, negotiated with lawmakers to have the language removed from the spending legislation, along with other provisions deemed to be so-called poison pills that would lead to a White House veto.
The spending package Mr. Trump is set to sign on Friday does, however, have language strengthening reporting requirements if the money is not obligated by budget officials within 90 days.
Two administration officials said that the veto threat was not a direct issue regarding Ukraine, but part of a broader effort to defend the president's authority to spend money at any time and in any manner that he determines appropriate.
The administration also objected to Democratic language that would have required the Office of Management and Budget to make public budget documents, known as apportionment letters, related to the release of aid to federal agencies, one official said. Those letters were used to freeze the Ukraine aid.
The administration argued, according to one official, that the documents were already sent upon request to Congress and the specific directives in the spending legislation were unnecessary.
Democrats also agreed to soften language surrounding the disbursement of aid to Central American countries, which Mr. Trump has previously threatened to end, according to one person familiar with the talks.
Had Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats refused to remove the language, the administration could have publicly announced its intent to veto the legislation and further jeopardized efforts to fund the government before funding lapsed at midnight Friday.
Leading Democrats played down the decision to eliminate the spending controls, which was part of a wide-ranging negotiation among the White House and senior Democrats and Republicans to forge a spending agreement that would avert a second consecutive Christmastime shutdown.
"These issues were negotiated primarily by the Appropriations Committee and O.M.B.," said Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. "These matters were two among dozens that had to be resolved in order to reach agreement on the two minibuses between both houses of Congress and the White House."

Texto completo: This year's skirmishes in the 'war on Christmas' are well underway. Former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker opened fire in early November with a decorative salvo, tweeting a tinseled conifer and insisting, 'This is not a holiday tree.'
More recently, a parade in Charleston, W.Va., became the epicenter of the conflict for 72 hours, as the New York Times reported, after the mayor wanted it to be a 'Winter Parade' rather than a 'Christmas Parade.' The Times picked up a Facebook post a local that was probably more revealing than intended: 'The new mayor needs to be voted out if she does away with the Christmas parade. Christmas is all about Christ, not some winter parade.'
Those news stories are reports on the mop-up operation from a key battle over Christmas that was lost to major retailers during the early and mid-20th century.
Once upon a time, Christmas was a 12-day feast that began with Christmas Eve and ended at Epiphany on Jan.-6. In the days prior, the church traditionally observed not Christmas but Advent, a time of preparation and reflection in a period that includes the four Sundays before Christmas.
For many years, these were not much observed in the colonies; in New England, the Puritans fought in the 17th century to suppress Christmas. Only in the 19th century, through the popularity of works such as Charles Dickens's 'A Christmas Carol' and the poem 'A Visit From St. Nicholas,' attributed to Clement Clarke Moore, a seminary professor whose father was an Episcopal bishop, did Christmas experience a sort of new beginning there.
Yet without strongly established norms of time and tradition, a quiet but real battle ensued. The victors were not the believers but the merchants.
For what Americans actually observe is not the traditional Christian feast of 12 days but a 'retail Christmas' that begins on Thanksgiving or Black Friday and ends on Christmas Eve.
The weapons of that war in the 1930s and '40s were seemingly innocent " the Coca-Cola Santa, 'Miracle on 34th Street' " cultural manipulations by capitalism that conflated the life-affirming values of family, community and gift-giving with the practices of unfettered consumption. How insidious and how brilliant to persuade us that belief in the magic of Christmas was itself a kind of faith " a faith whose penitential practice was guilt for not buying the right presents or enough of them, and whose sacraments came as licensed carbonated beverages and branded consumer goods.
So that war was won and lost, and Christians, who by rights would be observing the penitential season of Advent now, not trimming trees or sipping eggnog, were not the winners.
The two feasts, both called 'Christmas,' don't actually overlap; one begins just as the other ends. 'Retail Christmas' begins by eviscerating Thanksgiving on the day after. Black Friday is the solemn ritualization of not being thankful at all (let alone reflective about the occupation of the continent by colonialists), and solemnly affirms that neither we nor anyone else have what we need, nor hence can we be thankful. Then it goads us into the shopping period that follows and, remarkably, stops on Christmas Eve, right when the traditional Christmas actually began. The reason is simple. When the shopping is done, 'Macy's Christmas' is done. Homo mercantilis " commercial humanity " has reached its climax at Christmas Eve and rests in glory.
What of the 'war on Christmas,' then? Walker and outraged citizens of Charleston really were not defending Christmas at all. They were defending the occupied territory won from the other Christmas long ago, not as a witness to faith, but as a form of cultural hegemony " a 'White Christmas,' indeed.
For Christians today, Advent could again be a time of anticipation and of preparation. Not to celebrate what has been won or to defend the ruins of Christian cultural dominance, but to ponder what has been lost and must be found again, including by people of faith. Counting the calendar differently will not save us from the vortex of mindless consumption by itself, but it could be a sign of the resistance.
It's not a time to be precious or self-righteous. We need not refuse or scorn all that the world celebrates in this holiday season, whether it places the name 'Christmas' on it. It is a season to share hospitality, to welcome and be welcomed without insisting that our name or brand defines or shapes the act. So, too, when it is time for celebration and gifts, it is a season to share what we have with the poor, to consider the labor that made the objects we may give or how they have impacted the fragile Earth.
It is not a bad thing to realize how alienated Christians have become from this season that appropriates Jesus, who, after all, was born in occupied territory, too.
People anticipate Jesus' coming at this time of year, not because we need something additional in our overfilled lives, but because we need something quite different, either from the seasonal excesses or from the Christian pretensions of what now passes as Christmas. People of faith know they need to be freed from sin, from suffering and from oppression; they may even need Jesus to free them from Christmas.

Trump's anti-Semitism order won't help

Texto completo: President Donald Trump signed an executive order Wednesday to reinforce that Jewish people targeted through anti-Semitic acts can be covered under the federal civil rights laws that ban discrimination based on national origin. The administration says this is to protect us from people saying and doing anti-Semitic things on college campuses.
Funny, as an American Jew I can tell you that the issuance of this executive order, which essentially just restates the policy that's long existed - by an administration that routinely propagates anti-Semitism and other forms of racism and xenophobia - does not make me feel safer.
For the last few decades, a certain slice of American Judaism has fixated on campus criticism of Israel as a principal emitter of anti-Semitic rhetoric and ideology. It's true that anti-Israel speech can all too easily veer into anti-Semitism, but that largely happens when critics from the left see all Jews as fundamentally Israeli, as foreign, as other.
Meanwhile, some defenders of Israel have promoted the notion that to criticize Israel is to criticize all Jews, thus creating a kind of feedback loop that only serves divisive forces both in the United States and abroad.
Enter Donald Trump. Since taking office, he has repeatedly hinted at the notion that American Jews are just not real Americans and are instead loyal to Israel. Over the weekend, he went to Florida and told the Israeli-American Council that some American Jews would not risk voting for Elizabeth Warren over Trump because her tax proposals would take away their money.
"You're not going to vote for the wealth tax," he said. "Yeah, let's take 100% of your wealth away. No, no. Even if you don't like me, some of you don't. Some of you, I don't like at all actually. And you're going to be my biggest supporters because you'd be out of business in about 15 minutes if they get it."
He matched his anti-Semitic slur of the greedy Jew with an equally anti-Semitic argument that some American Jews "don't love Israel enough," as if we are required by our Judaism to be loyal to this other country. This is a red flag for American Jews because of the long history of "dual loyalty" allegations that have led to violence against Jews.
This isn't Trump's first offense by far. For example, last April he spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, telling the audience that Netanyahu was "your prime minister." American Jews have no prime minister. What they have is an American president who seems fixed on disavowing them, repeatedly suggesting that Israel, not America, is our "true" home.
Many Jews who live in the United States feel great affection for Israel. I've always had deeply conflicted feelings about the country, and I too believe that hate speech is a dangerous precursor to hateful acts.
But even as violence escalates against American lews, there's little evidence that criticism of Israel on college campuses (including over the Boycott, Divestment and Sanction movement) is a leading factor.
In fact, data from the Anti-Defamation League show that most extremist violence, including but not limited to acts directed at Jews, comes from white supremacists.
Meanwhile, many of the very people who rail against "cancel culture," "trigger warnings" and "safe spaces" on campus are seeking more tools to silence political opponents. The Trump administration has responded by crafting this executive order, giving them more power to silence left-wing speech on campus. The hypocrisy is obvious, and the specifics worry me.
The executive order states that Title VI doesn't protect Jews because of religion, but only if the discrimination arises from race, color or national origin. The New York Times article that broke the story Tuesday night, and attributed its reporting to several unnamed administration officials, cast the news as a change to the legal definition of Jews with respect to Title VI as having a shared, non-U.S. national origin. This set off an alarm bells for many and was amplified into an enormous furor online. On Wednesday, when the executive order was made public, we could see that it made more modest claims, creating a kind of backlash to the furor, as news organizations, and Twitter, backpedaled.
But let us not overcorrect here for premature outrage. The order IS worrying: So much depends on how it is used by the president's Justice Department. The order sows confusion around whether to treat Jews as belonging to a foreign race, which in fact is a core anti-Semitic talking point.
If applied by this president and his administration against left-wing students... well, I worry that we've just handed him a tool to stoke division and hate, and make us all less safe.
The executive order offers a new tool for the Trump administration to penalize Jewish critics of Israel as anti-Semites.
Even as the Trump administration announced its executive order, though, American Jews on the left were acting against discrimination and xenophobia elsewhere. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 activists from Never Again Action, at least most of whom were Jews, staged actions in San Diego, Rhode Island and Missouri aimed at shutting down facilities associated with immigration enforcement through civil disobedience. They were demanding the simple right to have doctors administer flu vaccines to detained immigrants.
Alyssa Rubin, an organizer for the group, told me, "Trump's executive order makes it clearer than ever why the fight against anti-Semitism and the fight against Trump's immigration policies are the same fight. We know what happens when people are categorized and told that they don't really belong. Never again means we fight as one."

Slater Fails to Earn Berth in Olympics

Texto completo: Slater's loss in the semifinals of the Billabong Pipe Masters gave the last spot on the American men's team to Florence, who has been Slater's longtime protégé, rival and neighbor.
No surfer has made more of big waves and big moments than Kelly Slater, and on Thursday at the Banzai Pipeline in Hawaii, the 47-year-old positioned himself for another memorable combination.
Having reached the semifinals of the Billabong Pipe Masters, an event he had won seven times in his career, Slater needed to win two more heats -- the semifinals and finals -- to overtake John John Florence and clinch a spot at the 2020 Summer Olympics.
But Slater's hopes were wiped out in the semifinal of Pipe Masters, the storied event on Oahu's North Shore that, this year, marked the end of the Olympic qualifying process for the World Surf League.
His loss to Brazil's Italo Ferreira gave the last spot on the American men's team to Florence, Slater's longtime protégé, rival and neighbor.
Florence, 27, won the season-long world title in 2016 and 2017. "I'm excited I accomplished that goal," he said. "I'm fired up."
Surfing will make its Olympic debut in Tokyo next summer. The field will be limited to two men and two women per country.
The American Kolohe Andino went into this event, the finale of the World Surf League season, ranked fifth in the standings and had already clinched one of the U.S. team's Olympic slots.
Slater needed to finish at least two rounds ahead of Florence to snare the other. On a sunny day of long lulls and inconsistent waves, both men reached the quarterfinals.
Slater came back to beat Jack Freestone of Australia with two big scores late in a slow heat, the last in a tight barrel to the right in the final 40 seconds.
"I saw it coming, I was so nervous," Slater said during an interview on the World Surf League live stream afterward. "I'm like, 'Oh, my God, I can't believe it's happening. That's the wave I need."'
With that kind of good fortune, Slater figured: "It's your day. It's supposed to happen to you. Maybe you put in the good work or did something nice for somebody, I don't know. Some kind of karma, maybe."
On shore, waiting for his heat, Florence watched and turned to the two-time world champion Gabriel Medina.
"How lucky is this guy?" Florence said.
Medina knocked Florence out of the event and put Slater's Olympic destiny in his own hands. But his good fortune did not last. Ferreira claimed a big lead in the semifinals, and time ran out on Slater, an 11-time world champion whose last title came in 2011. Unable to secure any noteworthy rides, he lost to Ferreira, 14.77 points to 2.57. Ferreira then beat Medina in the final for his first world title, preventing Medina from winning his third.
Slater had hoped that the Summer Games would cap his career.
"Surfing in the Olympics, that would mark 40 years of competing for me, next year," Slater told The New York Times last month. "It would be my 40th year since I surfed my first contest, when I was 8 years old. To potentially surf at the Olympics when I'm 48, it would be a nice sort of bookend for me."
After the loss, he was asked about his plans to compete in 2020. He will be 48 in February.
"I might have to do one more lap," he said with a laugh. "We'll see. I don't know."
The women's Olympics spots were determined earlier this month in the season-ending event in Maui. The United States will be represented by Carissa Moore, who won her fourth world title, and Caroline Marks.
For the men, the stakes and the setting on Thursday made for compelling theater. Pipeline, at Sunset Beach, is the world's most famous surf break.
Florence grew up directly in front of Pipeline and now lives a short walk down the beach. Slater, a Floridian who has made the North Shore his winter home for years, has a house at Pipeline, next door to Florence's mother.
Slater and Florence have shared years together, on tour around the world and at home on Sunset Beach. They even shared a cat, which they buried together in the yard when it died.
In interviews last month, both Slater and Florence acknowledged their zeal to compete at the Summer Games. Slater, disappointed with his season results, called it "a weird pressure in my head all year." Florence had not surfed in competition since June, when he ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee and had reconstructive surgery.
"The reason I did this event was to be in the Olympics," Florence said. "And I tried my best."
Florence was so strong in the spring that he arrived at Pipe Masters still ranked eighth in the world. Slater was 10th.
Slater's perfect 10-point ride in the round of 32 last week -- when he disappeared inside a long barrel to his right and appeared in daylight with his fists pumping and the crowd cheering -- reminded everyone that his capabilities had not diminished.
The contest stalled for a week as strong swells subsided. During that time, Slater knew that he had to reach the two-man final to have a chance at passing Florence in the standings.
The limited field for the Olympics made for other notable omissions. Brazil came to Pipeline with the top three surfers in the world rankings. When Filipe Toledo lost in the round of 32, he handed the Olympics spots to Ferreira and Medina.
A similar situation occurred with the women's championship tour, dominated this season by three Americans. When Lakey Peterson lost early in the year's final event, Moore and Marks earned the only spots in Tokyo.
Some have suggested that Slater should be granted an automatic entry to the Olympics, a nod to his fame and influence in the sport. But it appears that his only chance is if one of the two American men misses the Summer Games because of injury.
"There's always a chance that a day before the contest you get a phone call: 'Hey, you can surf it,"' Slater told The Times last month. "So I'm not going to be too bummed if I don't make it. And even if I do make it, I could break another foot or something. I'll wait until that moment comes."

Texto completo: LOS ANGELES — Andrew Yang chided the media for breathlessly covering President Trump's impeachment after the sixth Democratic primary debate opened with a question about the issue.
"We have to stop being obsessed over impeachment ... and start digging in and solve the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place," Yang said in Los Angeles.
The entrepreneur and nonprofit organization executive, 44, on Thursday urged the party to adopt a "positive" vision for the country because voters were losing trust with their lawmakers and political institutions.
The debate comes a day after the Democratic majority House voted for two articles of impeachment against Trump, over the Ukraine military aid affair.
The key issue for Yang's 2020 presidential campaign is the problem posed to the U.S. economy by automation. He has surprised many political commentators with his White House bid's longevity, outlasting traditional, establishment candidates to become the sole minority contender to qualify for the last debate of 2019.
Earlier in Thursday's broadcast, PBS NewsHour anchor and debate moderator Judy Woodruff confused him with fellow lower-tier hopeful Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager and Democratic megadonor.

Texto completo: The only problem with impeachment is that it might drive Donald Trump even crazier than usual.
Or probably.
The scariest thing about the whole process has been the president’s absolute, total inability to handle it like a sane person, let alone a sensible politician. On the day before the impeachment vote, when reporters asked Trump if he accepted any responsibility for what was happening, he did not say, “I just wish I could have been clearer about my total dedication to the country’s welfare.” He said: “No. I don’t take any.”
This was at a meeting with the president of Guatemala, during which Trump suggested that Guatemalans, whose country is mired in political corruption and violence, would know how to handle those House Democrats.
During the impeachment debate, Republicans howled about how the opposition was trying to turn back the results of the 2016 election. It’s true that Democrats would love to be living in a country where the woman who won the popular vote was in the White House. But, as Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler pointed out, if Trump actually did get tossed out of office, “the new president will be Mike Pence, not Hillary Clinton.”
What no one in Trump’s party admitted was that many of them would secretly love, love to replace him with a Republican who’s not nutty. Boring, sure, but there are times when dull is delightful.
The events leading up to the House’s big day were a pretty good example of how out of control the president has become. He sent a loopy six-page letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, attacking her for saying, “I pray for the president.” (“It is a terrible thing you are doing but you will have to live with it, not I!”)
He forwarded the letter to members of Congress — in the same package as the White House Christmas card. Meanwhile, a Times analysis found five of its claims were false, seven misleading and five exaggerated. Hey, nobody’s perfect.
In the impeachment vote run-up, Trump also tweeted that Pelosi’s “teeth were falling out of her mouth.” We are not going to discuss the state of the speaker’s teeth, which appear to be fine. And you cannot let him pull you into this kind of rabbit hole. It’s nasty to make fun of politicians’ personal appearance. Next thing, you’ll be talking about people’s hair and deeply artificial skin color.
Trump has been constantly complaining that the Democrats are treating him like a victim of the Salem witch trials. (It could be worse — in the House, one Georgia Republican compared the president to Jesus and the Democrats to a lesser version of Pontius Pilate.)
The Salem theme is never going away. On Wednesday, Trump sent an email to supporters whining that “No President ever could have endured or passed this many witch hunts.” The missive ended, of course, with a request for cash. (“Before the upcoming vote, I want to post another HUGE fundraising number.”)
He also tweeted his all-purpose outrage: “Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, AND I DID NOTHING WRONG! A terrible Thing. Read the Transcripts. This should never happen to another President again. Say a PRAYER!”
This would presumably be a better type of prayer than the ones Pelosi is saying.
While the president was tweeting his wrath, the House debate went on for eight hours. Republicans continually demanded that Congress let voters make the decision about Trump’s future in 2020. Democrats warned that would give him a lot more time to mess around with the Constitution. “Just last week Rudy Giuliani was back at it in Ukraine, so please don’t tell us to wait, because the corruption continues,” argued Cedric Richmond of Louisiana.
It’s a good point. Trump isn’t likely to reform since he thinks everything he’s done is “perfect.” The current crisis is about stuff he’s already done. But the far scarier subtext is what he still thinks is a good idea. Like Rudy.
During the debate, the Republicans were perhaps louder, and yelling generally works pretty well if you’re limited to two minutes. They castigated the House procedures and the Democrats’ intentions. They ranted on about everything, Nadler noted, “except a defense of President Trump’s conduct — which is indefensible.”
The Democrats spent a whole lot of time talking about the founding fathers. (“In Federalist No. 65, Alexander Hamilton wrote. …”) Hamilton came up constantly. Really, somebody should write a play about him.
It was certainly a long day of speechifying. But we’re here for a major moment in American history. Stop complaining for a minute and take it in. Pretty awesome.
Impeachment doesn’t do anything without Senate conviction. But Trump is perfectly aware of — OK, tormented by — the fact that a vote to impeach, all by itself, puts a big asterisk next to his name.
“It will follow him around for the rest of his life,” predicted California Democrat Ted Lieu during the debate.
Unless Trump does something so ungodly that being impeached will just look like a footnote. Shudder.

BETHEL — The Maine Mineral and Gem Museum had a rocking first weekend, to say the least.
After 12 years of preparation, the MMGM officially opened to the public last Thursday. Hundreds of people poured in over the weekend, with an estimated five to six hundred showing up for a meteorite giveaway Saturday. The first 200 school-aged kids to show up were given a small piece of Odessa meteorite, which came from a meteorite found near Odessa, Texas.
The meteorite is protected in a small case and along with that, children also received a certificate of authenticity.
The museum holds the five largest pieces of moon on Earth, the biggest known piece of Vesta asteroid, as well as thousands of minerals and other interactive exhibits.
The museum has received coverage from the Boston Globe and New York Times newspapers. MMGM Director Barbara Barrett appeared on Fox News earlier this year and has also been on several local news channels in Maine.
“To have a museum of such significance in downtown Bethel is a dream come true,” Advancement Director at MMGM Jessica Siraco said. “We’re really hoping it’s going to bring a lot of people to the town. We have the meteorites, but also the largest collections of Maine minerals and gems than anywhere else; it’s going to attract people from all over the globe.”
Admission for adults is $15. Children under the age of 12 get in free and there are other rates for seniors, students and veterans.
The MMGM might be of help to anyone searching for last minute holiday gifts, too. Currently, the museum is offering memberships starting at $25 for an individual. All membership prices will increase on Jan. 1.
Perks of an individual membership include invitations and advance notices to special events, unlimited admission for one year and a 10 percent museum store discount (some exclusions apply). Family and supporting memberships are being sold at $50 and $125. While the family package includes the same benefits as an individual (price is higher due to number of people), a supporting membership will include a North American Reciprocal membership, two guest passes (one-time use) and recognition on the annual report.
The museum is open Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays from 10 to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 11 to 5 p.m. It is closed Tuesdays. For more information go tohttps://mainemineralmuseum.org/

Texto completo: Solo siete de los 15 precandidatos demócratas participarán esta noche en el sexto y último debate de 2019, que se celebrará un día después de que Congreso aprobara la noche del miércoles el juicio político en contra del presidente Donald Trump.
En el encuentro, que se llevará a cabo en la Universidad de Loyola Marymount en Los Ángeles, se enfrentarán nuevamente los tres precandidatos que lideran las encuestas: el exvicepresidente Joe Biden encabeza las preferencias con un 28%, seguido por el senador Bernie Sanders (19%) y por la senadora Elizabeth Warren (14,8%), según el compilado de encuestas RealClearPolitics (RCP).
Se espera Warren protagonice una de la confrontaciones de la jornada junto a Pete Buttigieg, quien aparece en el cuarto lugar (8,2%) de las encuestas. La senadora y el alcalde de South Bend han incrementado el intercambio de ataques, especialmente en temas relacionados con transparencia, como los orígenes de sus fondos de campaña o la información sobre devoluciones de los impuestos, según detalla The New York Times.
En el debate participarán también Andrew Yang, exejecutivo de la industria de la Tecnología; Amy Klobuchar, senadora demócrata por Minnesota, y Tom Steyer, multimillonario y activista por el cambio climático.
Biden llega fortalecido
Biden, de 77 años, ocupará por primera vez en los debates de este año, la posición central en el escenario. El exvicepresidente llega a la cita fortalecido por el apoyo recibido de John Kerry, que fue jefe de la diplomacia en el segundo mandato de Barack Obama, pero como en cada debate surgen los miedos por su propensión a salirse del libreto y sus lapsus.
A principios de diciembre, Biden se exasperó con un votante que cuestionó el rol de su hijo en la compañía de energía ucraniana Burisma, que está en el centro del escándalo que desató el proceso de juicio político contra Trump. El compañero de fórmula de Obama en sus dos mandatos le respondió aireado descalificándolo como un “maldito mentiroso” y además lo llamó “gordo”.
Para hacer frente a las críticas, Biden publicó el martes un parte médico sobre su salud.
El principal capital de Biden es su experiencia y su promesa de que si es electo el país va a volver a la normalidad, dejando atrás la polarización de la era Trump. Con estas credenciales, Biden se ha labrado el preciado apoyo de los obreros y de las comunidades negras.
Además, ha prometido ha prometido abrir un camino a la ciudadanía a todos los inmigrantes indocumentados actualmente en el país, entregando una serie de propuestas para sus primeros 100 días de gobierno, para, según dijo, revertir la “dañina” política migratoria de Trump.
El debate se desarrollará bajo la sombra de Bloomberg, que pese a su avance en las encuestas no logró clasificarse ya que no tiene el mínimo de 200,000 donantes individuales. El millonario, que financia su propia campaña, sabe que llegó tarde a la contienda por lo que se concentrará en los estados que votarán a partir de marzo, entre ellos Texas y California.
El camino a la nominación
Tras el debate, solo faltarán 46 días para que empiecen, en Iowa, las votaciones para las primarias, en un largo camino que terminará a mediados de año con la Convención del Partido Demócrata y la definición del candidato que participará en las elecciones de noviembre de 2020.
En este proceso, en el que a medida que van votando los estados los distintos candidatos van sumando delegados, son muy importantes los resultados en los primeros en votar. En Iowa, Buttigieg – que está rezagado a nivel nacional – lleva la delantera con 22,5%, seguido de Sanders con 19,3% y de Biden con 18%.
En el siguiente estado en votar, New Hampshire, la tendencia se invierte y Sanders es el favorito con 19%, seguido por Buttigieg con 17,7% y de Biden con 14%.

Texto completo: UPDATE: Sudhan Thomas, the president of the Jersey City Board of Education, told the Washington Examiner in a statement, "As the JCBOE President it is within my power and importantly my responsibility to offer a resolution for the Board's consideration tomorrow night at our monthly Board meeting to address this issue. My proposed resolution will ask the full Board to consider, not only to censure Ms. Paige for her posting, but also request that she tender her letter of resignation from the Jersey City Board of Education, effective immediately. I have come to this conclusion after a lot of review, outside counsel but importantly in the continuum of the strong sentiments expressed by the elected political leadership across Jersey City, Hudson County and the State of New Jersey."

Democratic New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy called for a Jersey City Board of Education trustee to resign after she implied the shooting at a Jewish market that left six dead last week, including the shooters, was justified.
Joan Terrell, who is black, issued a lengthy comment on Facebook attacking the "brutes of the [J]ewish people" after Lincoln High School Principal Chris Gadsden shared a column from InsiderNJ. The column was about a recent event in which religious and civic leaders came together to address the shooting and the hate that led to what authorities believe was a "targeted" attack.
"We will not let anti-Semitism and hate go unchallenged in our communities," Murphy said on Twitter. "In light of Ms. Terrell-Paige’s comments, I urge her to immediately resign from the Jersey City Board of Education."
Tweet
Murphy's push for Terrell's resignation came after Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop did the same. Fulop, 42, also a Democrat, said her "language has no place in our schools and no place amongst elected officials."
Tweet
Terrell's rant began by accusing Jewish residents of forcing black Americans out of their homes and went on to reference community programs that have been eliminated.
"Where was all this faith and hope when Black homeowners were threatened, intimidated, and harassed by I WANT TO BUY YOUR HOUSE brutes of the jewish community? They brazenly came on the property of Ward F Black homeowners and waved bags of money. Resistance was met with more threats of WE WILL BRING DRUG DEALERS AND PROSTITUTES TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO YOU. YOU WILL SELL TO US THEN," she wrote.
The education board trustee — who is a member of the Jersey City Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the New Jersey Association of Black Educators, and the Mature African Americans for Mammography — also claimed that "6 rabbis were accused of selling body parts" and asked, "Where is the truth in those reports?"
While it's unclear what exactly she was referencing with this claim, she may be referring to a 2009 corruption investigation that resulted in the arrests of 44 people, including three New Jersey mayors, two state assemblymen, and five rabbis. The New York Times reported that the "illegal sales of body parts" was involved in the scandal.
Terrell's post, which was deleted by Gadsden, went on to address the shooting at a kosher market, where David Anderson, 47, and Francine Graham, 50, shot and killed a police officer and three others before being killed in a standoff with law enforcement officials. The shooters were allegedly trying to target a Jewish day school nearby but turned their attention to the market when they couldn't get into the school.
“Mr. Anderson and Ms. Graham went directly to the Kosher supermarket,” Terrell wrote. “I believe they knew they would come out in body bags. What is the message they were sending? Are we brave enough to explore the answer to their message? Are we brave enough to stop the assault on the black communities of America?”

She concluded her post by explaining that she is speaking "as a private citizen" and that her beliefs "are mine and mine alone." Despite the backlash and calls for her resignation, she told Politico she doesn't regret the remarks.
Sudhan Thomas, the president of the Jersey City Board of Education, told the Washington Examiner that her comments "do not reflect the JCBOE outlook or value system" and added, "There is no room for any kind of hate or bigotry in Jersey City."
Terrell, who grew up in the area she currently presides over, is currently serving her first term on the Jersey City Board of Education. In the lead up to last year's election, the Jersey City Education Association's PAC endorsed her and two other board members, Marilyn Roman and Mussab Ali, both of whom won their races as well.

Texto completo: A pediatrician practicing in Oxford, Mississippi has pleaded guilty to groping a sleeping woman's breast during an airplane flight from New York to Memphis.
He will pay a fine and leave the United States, according to federal court documents.
Dr. Rajesh Subramanya had worked at Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi through a staffing agency but was removed following his arrest, a spokeswoman for the Baptist hospital group said.
The doctor entered a guilty plea Thursday to a charge of simple assault, a misdemeanor, according to recently unsealed court records.
He was sentenced to one year probation, a $3,000 fine and a special assessment of $10, according to the records.
The physician holds passports from both the United Kingdom and India, according to the records. A court docket entry says, "Defendant to return to the United Kingdom."
It wasn't clear when the doctor planned to leave the country.
Subramanya's attorney, Mark McDaniel, did not immediately return a phone call. Efforts to reach Subramanya Friday were unsuccessful.
September flight, woman's report led to doctor's arrest, guilty plea Thursday's guilty plea marks a rapid conclusion to a case which originated less than three months earlier.
According to an affidavit written by FBI Special Agent Daryl C. Murton, the case began on Sept. 29, when a woman – herself a doctor going through residency – called the Memphis Police Department.
The Commercial Appeal generally does not identify sexual assault victims.
The woman reported that she had been groped while on board Delta Flight 3359 from New York's LaGuardia airport to Memphis.
The MPD took a report and referred her to the Memphis airport police department, which in turn referred her to the FBI.
"The reports indicated that (the woman) slept during the September 29, 2019 flight but awoke as the plane descended near Memphis to land," the FBI agent wrote.
"Lights were turned on in the cabin in preparation for landing. At that moment, (the woman) felt as though a hand were pulled back from her breast. She looked at the man seated to her right, and he appeared to be asleep.
"A short time later, the lights in the cabin were turned off, and thinking she might have imagined things, (the woman) closed her eyes and laid her head back.
"Shortly after this (the woman) felt the male passenger's hand go under the sweater she had draped over herself like a blanket, inside her shirt, and under her bra, grabbing her breast.
"(The woman) recoiled, and the male passenger used his hand to move up and down on two of her fingers in a sexual gesture. (The woman) pulled her hand away. The man asked her if he could touch her and she said no.
"He then proceeded to strike up a conversation with (the woman) during which he revealed he was a pediatrician in Oxford, Mississippi named 'Raj.' Upon learning that (the woman) was a doctor in residency, he suggested they exchange phone numbers for professional networking purposes. (The woman) did so as she thought it may assist in identifying him later."
Once the plane landed, the woman quickly left the airport and phoned her father, an attorney, who advised her to call the police. That's when she made the reports to the Memphis police agencies and the FBI, an affidavit said.
The FBI used the phone number to identify the passenger as Subramanya, and the woman also identified him from a photo lineup.
"FBI Memphis asked (the woman) to participate in a surreptitiously recorded conversation with Mr. Subramanya and the call was conducted on October 11, 2019," the affidavit said. "During the call, Mr. Subramanya was very apologetic for their interaction on the flight, but did not specify precisely what he was sorry for."
Then on Oct. 31, FBI agents interviewed the pediatrician at his home in Oxford.
"During that interview, Mr. Subramanya stated that he touched (the woman's) arm and asked her if he could touch her.
"She was leaning toward his seat as she slept and he stated he took that to mean she welcomed his touch. Mr. Subramanya stated that he then proceeded to touch (the woman's) breast through her clothing.
"When pressed by the interviewing agents to explain why he interpreted (the woman's) lean as an indication of consent for him to touch her, Mr. Subramanya confessed that he was aware that (the woman's) movement toward him did not mean she consented to be touched by him."
The interview appeared to rattle the doctor, the FBI agent wrote.
"During the interview, Mr. Subramanya expressed concern about what may happen to him as a result of this incident. Subsequent to the interview, Mr. Subramanya called and texted Special Agent Daryl Murton (the writer of the affidavit) several times echoing those same concerns."
The affidavit says that on Nov. 18, agents received information from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that Subramanya had booked a flight from Memphis to India scheduled to leave the next day, Nov 19.
"The FBI, in conference with CBP, are concerned that Mr. Subramanya may be attempting to depart the country over concerns of potential prosecution," the agent wrote.
He requested a warrant for the doctor's arrest. On Nov. 19, the doctor was taken into custody in Memphis, according to records.
After an initial court appearance, Subramanya was released on his own recognizance and told not to leave west Tennessee or north Mississippi without permission. He also surrendered his travel documents to the authorities: Two passports from the UK, one from India, according to records.
He returned to court on Thursday with his attorney in a hearing before Chief Magistrate Judge Diane K. Vescovo. According to notes in the court record, he entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor assault charge.
The plea agreement said that if he paid the $3,000 fine and the $10 fee, his passports would be returned to him. According to court records, those passports were returned to him that day.
Doctor began working at Oxford hospital in August A Mississippi medical licensing web site lists Subramanya as a 1999 graduate of Government Medical College Mysore, a medical school in India.
He had apparently been working at Baptist Memorial Hospital-North Mississippi only a short time — the hospital had announced his arrival in a Facebook post on Aug. 15 of this year and identified him as a pediatric hospitalist.
A pediatric hospitalist is a doctor who specializes in treating children who have been admitted to a hospital, rather than treating them in an outpatient setting such as a clinic. While Subramanya worked inside the Baptist hospital, his actual employer was a physician staffing company called Envision, said Ayoka Pond, a spokeswoman for hospital group Baptist Memorial Health Care.
"However, as soon as we found out he had been arrested, we removed him from our rotation. So he no longer works in our hospital," she said.
Similar cases
Similar sexual assaults on airplanes have been reported across the country, according to The New York Times. Last year, a man in the Detroit area was sentenced to nine years in prison for a sexual assault during a flight.
In that case and many others, the victims were asleep. Questions over law enforcement jurisdiction make reporting and prosecuting the offenses more difficult, The Times reported.
The FBI's Seattle field office launched an awareness campaign on the issue and reported that in fiscal year 2014, 38 cases of in-flight sexual assault were reported to the FBI. In 2017, the number rose to 63 before dropping again to 39 in the 2018 fiscal year, The Times reported.
Among the FBI's safety tips are to be aware that alcohol or drugs can put you in a deep sleep, and that offenders will often test their victims, sometimes pretending to brush against them to see how they react or if they wake up.
"If such behavior occurs, reprimand the person immediately, and consider asking to be moved to another seat," the FBI recommends. The agency also recommends reporting any incidents to the flight crew immediately.

'Bombshell' blows up myths and facts

Texto completo: "Bombshell" exploded into the awards race last week, leading the Screen Actors Guild Awards nominations with four nods, including best ensemble, actress (Charlize Theron) and supporting actress (Margot Robbie and Nicole Kidman).
The drama (in theaters in New York and Los Angeles, expanding nationwide Friday) goes behind the scenes at Fox News in 2016. It chronicles the efforts of a group of women – including on-the-outs host Gretchen Carlson (Kidman) and star anchor Megyn Kelly – to expose a culture of misogyny, leading to the ouster of Machiavellian CEO Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), who was accused of sexual harassment by more than 20 women.
Fox News spokesperson Caley Cronin declined to comment to USA TODAY beyond confirming that "Bombshell" producers "never reached out to Fox News during any part of the production."
The film was directed by Jay Roach ("Trumbo") and written by Charles Randolph ("The Big Short"), who breaks down what's fact, fiction and somewhere in between.
Is Robbie's character real?
Robbie plays an ambitious, wide-eyed staffer named Kayla Pospisil. A lifelong Fox News fanatic and young evangelical ("I see myself as an influencer in the Jesus space," she says), Pospisil soon catches the eye of Ailes, who promises to promote her to on-air talent in exchange for sexual favors.
Although Pospisil is a fictional character, her experiences of harassment are drawn from interviews Randolph and Roach conducted with ex-Fox News staffers (some of whom violated their non-disclosure agreements to speak with filmmakers).
"What happens inside of Roger's office is based on the stories of three women we had access to," Randolph says. The rest is pulled from Randolph's evangelical upbringing.
"Her being ideologically fervent like a dedicated Republican, but a little sexually fluid and utterly morally sincere, that's based more on women in my life."
Is McKinnon's character fictional?
The "Saturday Night Live" favorite is a scene-stealer as Pospisil's savvy co-worker Jess Carr, a closeted lesbian and liberal who has complicated feelings about working at a network that preaches against her values and lifestyle.
Carr was "all made up," Randolph says.
"I wanted to show the bystander narrative. Megyn's story is the story of someone who comes to discover she is complicit by virtue of the institutional norms and her ability to manipulate them in the predation of a younger generation of women. Likewise with Kayla: Her willingness to look the other way creates this dynamic, and she realizes at the end that it affects herself."
Did someone poison Kelly?
The film begins with an anxious but steely Kelly en route to moderate the first debate of the Republican primary campaign. She accepts coffee offered by her driver, only to fall violently ill before the debate is about to begin. Rattled, she later relays the incident to Ailes, wondering aloud whether it was nerves or if the man tampered with her drink.
The scene is lifted directly from Kelly's 2016 memoir "Settle for More," although the journalist refuted inferences by the New York Times and others that she was poisoned. Yet "Bombshell" leaves the circumstances around her mystery illness intentionally vague.
"Roger said, 'How dare you have a cup of coffee from a guy you don't know. What are you, crazy?'" Randolph says. "Megyn has a good ear for absurdist details."
Did Ailes consult Rudy Giuliani?
"Bombshell" is a who's who of famous faces, including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Ailes' legal counsel Susan Estrich, and Connie Britton as Ailes' wife, Beth. Then there's Richard Kind, who portrays Ailes' friend Rudy Giuliani. The embattled Ailes asks the politician/attorney how to handle the fallout of his sexual harassment allegations.
"Ailes had three different lawyers who we let Giuliani stand in for," Randolph says. "If you wanted to be a Republican public intellectual, all avenues went through Roger Ailes' office, and that mattered in terms of his ability to prey on young people who had aspirations."
Was Ailes known as 'the legs man'?
The film shows a competitive work environment at Fox News for female anchors and producers, many of whom rarely spoke or befriended each other. (Kelly and Carlson, for instance, only share the screen once in passing in an elevator – true to real life, where they worked different shifts and "almost never interacted," Randolph says.)
"Bombshell" also illustrates Ailes' predatory behavior: asking women to spin in front of him during meetings, and demanding that on-air talent wear short skirts to show off their legs. Such scenes were drawn from Kelly's book, as well as Gabriel Sherman's 2014 Ailes biography "The Loudest Voice in the Room" and Sarah Ellison's 2016 expose for Vanity Fair, Randolph says.
"All the women who filed complaints about him who have gone public have been really brave in articulating what happened to them," Randolph says.
The film's most chilling scene is a private meeting between Ailes and Pospisil when he pressures her to lift her skirt. The camera lingers on Pospisil, near tears, as he orders her to inch it higher and higher, revealing her underwear. By letting the abuse play out in real time, Randolph hopes male viewers, in particular, will feel uncomfortable but also feel greater empathy for victims.
"When you're in the room and you appreciate the intonations and context of it, you can see how it could be utterly life-changing and maddening and complicated for a young woman,'" he says.

Texto completo: The enormous defense bill, one of the most expensive in the nation's history, contains a litany of bipartisan rebukes to Russia, Turkey and China.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly to pass a bipartisan $ 738 billion defense policy bill, sending President Trump one of the most expensive military measures in the nation's history and one that he has championed as a critical priority.
The vote was 86 to 8 to clear the measure, which authorizes a 3 percent pay increase for the troops. It came as lawmakers sought to close out a burst of year-end bipartisan legislating even as the House is on the brink of impeaching Mr. Trump, and ended a monthslong period of disputes between Republicans and Democrats over how to steer military policy.
"Let the vote be so overwhelming there isn't a military family in America who could doubt our commitment to them," Senator Jim Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said before lawmakers approved the bill. "Let's use our vote to send a message to Russia and China that we're revitalizing America's power so we can win the competition for influence that will shape the kind of world our children and grandchildren are going to live in."
The legislative package contains a pair of specific victories for Mr. Trump, who is expected to sign the bill this week. It authorizes the Space Force, which he proposed last year -- initially, in his own telling, as a joke -- as the sixth branch of the American military. It would also provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave for civilian federal employees, a Democratic priority that was embraced by his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
But it also contains a litany of rebukes to countries that have invoked bipartisan wrath on Capitol Hill, including Russia, China and Turkey.
The measure includes sanctions meant to block the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project spearheaded by a Russian energy company that would create an underwater pipeline under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany, essentially circumventing Ukraine in an attempt to reduce reliance on Ukraine's pipelines to deliver gas to Europe.
Another provision would bar Turkey from acquiring American-made F-35 fighter jets, a rebuke of Ankara's purchase of a Russian missile defense system, the S-400. Turkey's foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, has made clear that Turkey intends to retaliate for the move with its own round of sanctions.
"As long as the S-400s are in Turkey under Turkish control, there will be no F-35s delivered to Turkey," said Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. "This is Erdogan's choice, and he is well aware of the consequences."
It is the latest reprimand Congress has delivered to Turkey, coming only a week after the Senate unanimously voted to recognize the Armenian genocide as a matter of American foreign policy. The State Department on Tuesday appeared to push back on that move, referring to a speech Mr. Trump gave in April that avoided naming the mass killings as a genocide.
The bill also seeks to take a harder line against China. It would bar Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, from unilaterally removing the Chinese telecom giant Huawei from a so-called entity list, which bans American corporations from supplying foreign companies deemed potential security threats, until the Commerce Department certifies to Congress that the company is no longer considered a security threat. The administration has previously offered the Chinese company a reprieve.
But the legislation is also notable for what it does not include, after Democrats agreed to jettison a number of provisions handcuffing the president on military matters. The House in July passed its own version of the bill that would have put a liberal stamp on defense policy, passing amendment after amendment that sought to rein in the president's powers, including on declaring war and diverting military construction funds to pay for his border wall.
Democratic lawmakers and aides from both the House and Senate, working to reconcile the House bill with the far less confrontational Senate measure, eventually agreed to drop those restrictions, in search of a deal with Republicans, who had uniformly opposed the House version. Two provisions that would have effectively prohibited the transfer of munitions to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen were also dropped, after Mr. Kushner, who helped negotiate the deal, intervened and indicated they were nonstarters for the White House.
Some Democrats were outraged by their party's concessions, and opposed the final legislation, though a number of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates -- including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- missed the vote.
"Call me a radical, but maybe before funding a new space force, we should make sure no American goes bankrupt because of a medical bill or dies because they can't afford to go to a doctor on time," Mr. Sanders wrote in a Washington Post op-ed article on Monday.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said that he “forced” former Ukraine Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch out of her role and leveled another round of allegations against the ousted diplomat in a series of recent interviews.
Speaking to multiple media outlets over the last few days, Giuliani shed light on his influence in removing Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post after she was targeted by what impeachment witnesses described as a “smear campaign. ”
Giuliani told The New Yorker in a November interview published Monday that he believed Yovanovitch was in the way of his attempts to pursue investigations Trump wanted.
The president is accused of putting pressure on Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to open investigations into 2020 frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who had ties to a Ukrainian company. Two articles of impeachment on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress are up for a House vote this week.
Marie Yovanovitch: A symbol of State Department resistance to Trump in impeachment inquiry
“I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way,” Giuliani is reported to have said. “She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody. ”
The revelation adds credence to the narrative of what Democrats believe took place in Ukraine: Giuliani attacked Yovanovitch in the media in an effort to discredit and remove her, clearing the way for him to pursue investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election.
But Giuliani sharply backtracked Monday evening in an interview on Fox News, saying that Yovanovitch "was acting corruptly in that position and had to be removed. " Giuliani claimed to have evidence, without providing it, that Yovanovitch made an untrue statement in her testimony before Congress.
“I didn’t need her out of the way. I forced her out because she’s corrupt,” Giuliani said to Fox News’ Laura Ingraham, doubling down on his role in ousting her but denying she presented an obstacle. "She should've been fired if the State Department weren't part of the deep state. "
"She at minimum enabled Ukrainian collusion," Giuliani tweeted Tuesday about Yovanovitch.
Giuliani said Yovanovitch orchestrated the denial of a visa to former Ukraine prosecutor Viktor Shokin, who was pushed out of his role during Biden's time in office because of the view he was not tough on corruption cases.
Explainer: Biden, allies pushed out Ukrainian prosecutor because he didn't pursue corruption cases
Testimony in the impeachment inquiry given by George Kent, an official within the State Department, reveals that the agency's reason for denying a visa was that Shokin was seen as corrupt and had wasted U. S. dollars. Kent said Shokin's trip to the U. S. was meant to spread a rumor that the U. S. embassy in Kiev was corrupt.
Yovanovitch concurred in her own testimony, and said Shokin had lied on his visa application by saying he was traveling to visit children.
"Knowing Mr. Shokin, I had full faith that it was a bunch of hooey, and he was looking to basically engage in a con game out of revenge because he'd lost his job," Kent said.
Speaking to The New York Times on Monday, Giuliani said he briefed the president about knowledge he says he gained about Yovanovitch, and said his information may have influenced the decision to pull her out of Ukraine: "You'd have to ask [Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo]. But they relied on it. "
“I think I had pointed out to the president a couple of times, I reported to the president, what I had learned about the visa denials,” Giuliani said. "I may or may not have passed along the general gossip that the embassy was considered to be a kind of out-of-control politically partisan embassy, but that was, like, general gossip, I didn’t report that as fact. "
Giuliani told CNN Tuesday that he and Trump are "on the same page" when it comes to his actions in Ukraine, but wouldn't say what Trump's involvement was in Giuliani's recent trip to Ukraine during the impeachment inquiry, when he says he gathered evidence on Yovanovitch.
Trump said Monday that Giuliani had not told him much about his most recent trip to Ukraine, but said his attorney "knows what he's doing. "
"He's a great person who loves our country and he does this out of love, believe me," Trump said of Giuliani.

China denounces secret expulsion of two diplomats suspected of spying in US

Texto completo: The Chinese government decried the secret expulsion of two of its diplomats suspected of espionage in the United States, making it the first official acknowledgment by either side of the expulsions.
A statement by the Chinese Foreign Ministry during a news conference on Tuesday demanded the U.S. reverse its decision.
“The U.S. accusation on our officials is completely inconsistent with the truth. We made stern representations and protests to the U.S. side. We urge the U.S. to correct its mistake, withdraw this decision and protect Chinese diplomats' legitimate rights and interests according to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,” Geng Shuang, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said when asked about the expulsions.
The U.S. government quietly expelled the diplomats this fall after they breached a sensitive military base in Virginia, the New York Times reported. They appear to be the first expulsions of Chinese diplomats suspected of spying in more than three decades. In 1987, the U.S. apprehended two Chinese diplomats who had tried to obtain classified National Security Agency documents.
Two Chinese officials were with their wives when they drove onto the base near Norfolk in September and only stopped when fire trucks blocked their path.
American officials suspect at least one of the Chinese officials was an intelligence officer operating under diplomatic cover.
After the New York Times published its story, Chinese Embassy officials privately explained the incident was an innocent mistake. Others said their colleagues were on a sightseeing trip and questioned whether the expulsions were in response to Beijing’s propaganda campaign in August against Julie Eadeh, a political officer in the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong.
American officials have increasingly sounded the alarm about China’s threat to national security. American officials said Chinese officials with diplomatic passports have become more daring about showing up unannounced at research or government facilities.

Michelle Goldberg: It is time to march for impeachment

Texto completo: Brian Kilmeade — the dark-haired guy on “Fox & Friends,” Fox News’ morning show — was surprised. During the program on Monday, a correspondent reported that a Fox News poll showed that 50% of voters favored impeaching and removing Donald Trump. (An additional 4% favored impeachment alone.) “I was stunned to see that that’s the number, because I thought that things were trending away,” said Kilmeade.
It’s tempting to think that he simply made the mistake of watching too much of his own network, but recently the idea that impeachment has been bad for the Democrats has been widespread. “Democrats’ impeachment obsession is backfiring,” The Washington Post’s Marc Thiessen crowed last month. “Indeed, it could prove to be the biggest political blunder in modern times.”
It could, but so far it hasn’t. After weeks of contentious, often exasperating hearings, most polls show backing for impeachment holding steady, with more people supporting than opposing it. Support for removing Trump from office is generally higher than was support for removing Richard Nixon in July 1974, the month before he resigned.
True, impeachment is less popular in several important swing states, which is cause for Democratic worry. And there have been a couple of polls that show it underwater with voters at large, including a recent one from Quinnipiac. But as David Graham recently wrote in The Atlantic, one underappreciated aspect of the Trump impeachment is how popular it is given the rarity and severity of the remedy. It’s certainly more popular than Trump himself.
That’s particularly true in some states where Republican senators are up for reelection in 2020. In Maine, where Susan Collins is still reportedly deciding on her political future, an October poll showed support for impeachment at 53%. Her own approval rating was 35%. The same month, a poll in Colorado, where Cory Gardner is facing a tough reelection battle, found that a plurality of 48% favored Trump’s impeachment and removal.
For some reason, though, I rarely hear pundits wagging their fingers at Republicans about the price they’ll pay for clinging to a president who is consistently out of step with mainstream American values. I suspect that’s because the media tends to unconsciously accept Republican ideas about who constitutes an “average American,” so that the majority of Americans who oppose Trump are treated like an elitist fringe.
After Brett Kavanaugh’s agonizing Supreme Court confirmation, Republicans insisted that Democrats would face a reckoning from outraged voters. Anger about Kavanaugh’s treatment may indeed have contributed to Democratic losses in North Dakota and Missouri. All the same, more voters opposed Kavanaugh’s confirmation than supported it, and polling indicated that the hearings motivated Democrats more than Republicans. Women furious at the treatment of Christine Blasey Ford, who upended her life by publicly accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault, helped power the blue wave that won Democrats the House and made impeachment possible.
Ultimately, there’s no way to know how small polling fluctuations on impeachment now will affect an election that’s almost a year away. But Trump’s skill at intimidating the political class into believing that he is anything but historically reviled still matters. It keeps his supporters in line and demoralizes his opponents. That’s why, with an impeachment vote in the House expected on Wednesday, it’s important for anti-Trump America to make itself visible.
For months now, many people, myself included, have looked at mass protest movements around the world and wondered why Americans horrified by the depravity of this administration aren’t taking to the streets. Well, on Tuesday evening, in every part of the country, many will be.
Over 550 protests calling for the impeachment and removal of Trump are planned, sponsored by a coalition of progressive groups including Public Citizen, Indivisible, the Service Employees International Union and the Sierra Club. There will be at least one protest in every state. [Including Utah.] If you are disgusted by Trump’s behavior, and by the way elected Republicans have built an impenetrable wall of lies to protect him, you should go.
Think back to how bleak it was the day of Trump’s inauguration. Then remember the exhilaration of the day after, as millions of people marched in the largest single day of protest in American history. The Women’s March helped blunt the momentum of Trump’s presidency before it started, sending the message that there would be popular resistance at every step.
High-profile protests have, perhaps naturally, waned as the Trump presidency has dragged on. Ordinary people can’t sustain a sense of emergency month after month, and much of the Resistance has poured itself into organizing around local elections. But this moment, when the political valence of impeachment is still unclear, and the fight for a thorough, transparent trial in the Senate is just beginning, citizens can make a real difference by gathering en masse and voicing their outrage.
Demonstrations aren’t just about pressuring Republicans, though. Despite cable and social media, local TV news is still many people’s primary news source. Because there are going to be demonstrations everywhere — there are eight planned for Montana alone — local TV will likely cover them. “Right now the message is coming from Washington,” Jonah Minkoff-Zern, an organizer with Public Citizen, told me Monday. “Tomorrow night, people are going to hear their neighbors’ voices.” If you want those voices to be amplified, you have to show up.

Texto completo: Gross domestic product, a measure of the total value of the nation’s economic output over a specific period, always has been among the broadest measures of economic performance. But, as noted in a series of columns by David Leonhardt of The New York Times, it also has been an indicator of individual financial wellbeing because personal financial progress often rose in near accord with GDP.
That especially was true after World War II, when vast manufacturing enterprises accounted for a high percentage of employment and powerful labor unions fought for labor’s share.
That started to change in the 1970s and has accelerated since, so that a graph line charting GDP growth still coincides roughly with the financial welfare of the top 10% of earners, but diverges sharply for the lower 90%.
Now the Commerce Department is working on a new calculation of GDP that still would calculate the overall performance but break it out to reflect the economic well-being of different income groups. The department plans to issue a prototype statistical model next year.
Congress should mandate the new calculation. As Nobel laureate economist Simon Kuznets, who oversaw the implementation of the GDP calculation, put it in 1934: “Economic welfare cannot be adequately measured unless the personal distribution of income is known.”

Giuliani: Trump 'relied On' His Claims About US Diplomat

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, says he provided the president with information that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was impeding investigations that could benefit Trump politically. Within weeks, she was recalled from her post.
In an interview with The New York Times, Giuliani portrayed himself as directly involved in the effort to oust Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, and he provided details indicating Trump's knowledge of that effort.
Giuliani's interview, published Tuesday, comes as Trump is facing near-certain impeachment Wednesday by the House for abuse of power over his pressure on Ukraine to announce investigations of Democrats while he was withholding aid to the Eastern European nation.
Giuliani said he passed along information to Trump "a couple of times" about how Yovanovitch had frustrated efforts that could help Trump, including efforts to have Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden.
Trump, in turn, passed the information on to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Giuliani said. Within weeks, Yovanovitch was told Trump had lost trust in her and she was recalled as ambassador.
Trump has said he did nothing wrong and his pressure on Ukraine was aimed at rooting out corruption there.
Early last year, Giuliani said, he told Trump that Yovanovitch was impeding investigations in Ukraine that could benefit Trump.
"There's a lot of reasons to move her," Giuliani told the Times. He said Trump and Pompeo "relied on" his information, likely leading to Yovanovitch's ouster last April.
"I just gave them the facts," Giuliani said. "I mean, did I think she should be recalled? I thought she should have been fired. If I was attorney general, I would have kicked her out. I mean - secretary of state."
Testimony in the Trump impeachment inquiry showed that the claims about Yovanovitch were either unsubstantiated or taken out of context.
In the Times interview, Giuliani portrayed himself as directly involved in the effort to derail Yovanovitch's career. He said he told Trump and Pompeo that Yovanovitch was blocking visas for Ukrainian prosecutors to come to the United States to present evidence that he claimed could be damaging to Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
"I think I had pointed out to the president a couple of times, I reported to the president, what I had learned about the visa denials," Giuliani said, as well as claims that she ordered one Ukrainian prosecutor to drop cases.
According to an article published Monday in The New Yorker, Giuliani said that he needed Yovanovitch "out of the way" and that she "was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody."
"I forced her out because she's corrupt," Giuliani told Fox News on Monday. He claimed that Yovanovitch "committed perjury" when she said she turned down the visa requests for a prosecutor because he was corrupt. Giuliani claimed he had witnesses "who will testify that she personally turned down their visas because they were going to come here and give evidence either against Biden or against the Democratic Party. "
Yovanovitch, testifying in October in defiance of Trump, said there was a "concerted campaign" against her based on "unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives."
In a tweet Tuesday, Giuliani insisted, "Yovanovitch needed to be removed for many reasons most critical she was denying visas to Ukrainians who wanted to come to US and explain Dem corruption in Ukraine. She was OBSTRUCTING JUSTICE and that's not the only thing she was doing. She at minimum enabled Ukrainian collusion."
Trump and his allies falsely claim that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election. The special counsel's investigation, as well as U.S. intelligence agencies, found that Russia, not Ukraine, meddled in the election.

Texto completo: PORT CLINTON – A Catawba Island beagle named Oscar is one of the dogs featured in the book "Doctor Dogs" by New York Times bestselling author Maria Goodavage
The book highlights medical alert dogs from around the world. Oscar was abandoned by his previous owner before Deanne "DeeDee" Kramer and her late husband, Bill, adopted him as a walking companion. But Oscar did more than become a walking buddy. He saved their lives.
Bill was struggling with complications from diabetes, which kept sending him to the emergency room several times a month. Finally, his doctor told him he needed to get a dog to help him become more active.
"We couldn't handle a lab," DeeDee said. "And then we heard about Oscar."
Oscar's first rescue came before he had any training. When Bill collapsed from a heart attack, Oscar, barking, ran to DeeDee to let her know. The incident exposed Oscar's intelligence and potential, and the Kramers decided to see if he could be trained as a diabetic alert dog to alert Bill when his blood sugar levels changed. Their search for a trainer eventually brought them to Nick and Tammy Blackford of North Coast K-9, who have offices in Sandusky and Monroeville. Nick, who has been training dogs since 1974, has trained many of the area's police dogs.
Oscar excelled through 500 hours of training, which included Canine Good Citizen, therapy dog, and public access training. His training to detect blood sugar level changes was intensive.
"He had to pass three tests before he could even start scent training," DeeDee said. "It's no different than training a drug dog, because it's all about smell."
To prepare for the training, Bill spit on cotton balls when his sugar was high and when his sugar was low. Nick placed those cotton balls, along with other cotton balls, in containers around the training facility. When Oscar found the right cotton ball, he was rewarded.
As a result, Oscar was able to detect when Bill's sugar changed. If it was high, he pawed on Bill's knees. If it was low, he pushed his nose into Bill's face.
"He was 10 minutes faster than the meter," DeeDee said. "After Oscar got trained, Bill had zero emergency room visits."
After Bill died, DeeDee's mourning kept her from caring for herself the way she normally did, and her hypoglycemia began to worsen. Now, Oscar alerts her when her blood sugar reaches dangerous levels.
"If I'm driving, he'll come from the back of the car and make me pull over," DeeDee said.
Dogs can be trained to respond to medical emergencies in a variety of ways that suit their owners' needs.
"Some are trained to bark so if the person is in another room with the door shut, the dog can still alert them," Nick said.
In addition to helping the Kramers, Oscar detected cancer in DeeDee's friend. The story of that miraculous rescue is recorded in "Doctor Dogs."
"He wasn't even trained for that," DeeDee said.
Oscar also accompanies DeeDee when she volunteers at the Ohio Veterans Home in Sandusky each week. He not only spreads love while he's there, but he also detects blood sugar levels in the veterans he visits.
DeeDee said it's not unusual for beagles to be trained as alert dogs because their ability to smell is so acute.
"Basset hounds are good, too," she said. "But if you want a diabetic alert dog, go to trainer, and they will find one suited to you. Don't just go out and get a puppy."

While Oscar's big eyes can melt hearts, his nose can save lives. Even though he was trained as a diabetic alert dog, he detected cancer in his owner's friend.

Texto completo: LAKEWOOD – If state lawmakers needed a nudge on the issue of extending New Jersey driver's licenses to immigrants without legal status, a contingent from this town was on hand to provide it.
Ahead of Monday's legislative action in Trenton, some 100 area residents — mostly from Lakewood, here without authorization and pining to drive legally — boarded a bus and filled vans and SUVs, aiming to demonstrate their support for the measure.
Many told the Press they saw the license bill as key to expanding opportunity for jobs and better housing. They said they wanted to be on hand for what they hoped would be a historic day — as important as any in ensuring a better future.
"Can't say I'm dancing with joy because it's too cold," local activist Norma Morales, 45, said in Spanish. "I was expecting 100 people tops, but many more showed up and members of our community are coming through with their own vehicles to take people there."
While Morales was busy making calls to coordinate rides to Trenton, others waited on the bus, for what they hoped would be a final push in a long overdue fight.
"We're going there to represent the thousands of people who cannot make it there today, those who need a license because they can't take their children to school or to the doctor, those of us who need a license," Víctor Cortez, 36, said in Spanish. "We're here for the people and with the people."
A construction worker, Cortez asked for the day off from work, despite the loss of pay. He said it was more important to join the group heading to Trenton and provide an example for his three U.S.-born children.
"This will give them an example when in the future they need something, they go out and fight for what their community needs, to go look for it and not be hoping somebody will make the decision for themselves," he said. "What we do is an example that we will pass onto our children."
Proponents of the measure said passage would be life-changing. Hours later, both the Assembly and the Senate endorsed the legislation, sending the landmark change to Gov. Phil Murphy.
While unauthorized immigrants have been barred from obtaining a driver's license in the Garden State, the reality is many are on the road anyway — with and without insurance and often with out-of-state documents — to get to work, the grocery store or doctor's appointments, immigrants and their advocates say.
The Garden State is home to more than 466,000 unauthorized immigrants of driving age, according to a 2018 report by the think tank NJ Policy Perspective.
About 233,000 unauthorized immigrants would become licensed drivers within three years of approval, the report concludes.
It's unclear how many are driving now, but the policy group and other bill proponents argue the roads would be safer with more motorists properly trained, tested and insured.
In New York, Monday also marked the start of that state's allowing those previously ineligible to get driver's licenses to apply. The New York Times reported that lines at state Department of Motor Vehicles offices "snaked around buildings" in New York City.
The Times reported that at a Bronx location, workers went outside around 12:30 p.m. to tell those waiting in line that the office's testing room was full.
Murphy, long a proponent of the license bill for New Jersey, has said he would sign it into law.

Texto completo: Readers react to The Times's editorial calling for the impeachment of President Trump, and to a news article about the likely trial in the Senate.
To the Editor:
Re "Impeach." (editorial, Dec. 15):
Thank you for a crystal-clear argument for impeachment. This should be part of the House presentation to the Senate.
Maybe truth can still win.
Herb Passberger
Glen Cove, N.Y.
To the Editor:
Americans are not grasping the importance of the impeachment proceedings and not taking them seriously because they do not see Donald Trump as a serious man in a profoundly serious position. He is perceived as if he were the star of a media show, "The White House."
Mr. Trump has diminished the office with barrages of tweets, public insults, veiled threats and grandstanding. His presidency now seems to be on a par with football games, sitcoms and quiz shows.
This is a dangerous situation; let's hope that the American public starts paying attention.
Shirley Stuart
Berkeley, Calif.
To the Editor:
As bad as President Trump's shakedown of a struggling Ukraine is, the House and Senate Republicans are worse. All of them are deliberately damaging this country even further by consciously working to deepen the divisions among Americans.
They support Mr. Trump's lies; they viciously attack their colleagues on the other side of the aisle; they repeat over and over again their own lies; they say everything they can dream up to defend the indefensible and to weaken this incredible Constitution of ours.
If the Republicans were true to their oath to protect and defend the Constitution, they would actually listen to the witnesses' sworn testimony. They are not even trying to discover the truth; they are simply making a sham out of this very serious process.
If they acted honestly, they would do much to educate the American public and help heal the divisions in this country.
Mary C. Helf
Flourtown, Pa.
To the Editor:
If the defense of the Constitution and the Republic are in the hands of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to impeach President Trump for the reasons argued in your editorial, the country is in big trouble.
Fortunately, the Republican-controlled Senate will restore sanity by acquitting the president, and American voters will have the last word on Election Day 2020 when they re-elect Mr. Trump, restore Republicans to the House majority and retain Republican control of the Senate.
Then, the Republic will not only endure, but it will also prevail and prosper.
Dennis L. Breo
New Smyrna Beach, Fla.
To the Editor:
Of course he will -- must -- be impeached. But as far as I know, President Trump is not entitled to a speedy trial in the Senate, where he can count on "jurors" who ordinarily would be excused for cause. A case in point is Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who has said he will be coordinating with the White House counsel in the process.
Also, Senator Lindsey Graham has pre-empted and rendered false the oath he will take to be fair by having decided the matter before considering the evidence. He should of course be excused.
Consequently, there is good reason for the House -- representatives of the people, not the president -- to delay sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate. At a minimum, it could give those who seek a fair trial the leverage to gain one by delaying until they are assured the right to call witnesses.
But even more critical, a delay might prevent Mr. Trump from rigging another game while allowing the House to pursue his numerous other offenses against the country.
Nancy Luque

To the Editor:
Re "Schumer Frames Full Senate Trial on Impeachment" (front page, Dec. 16):
Be careful what you wish for.
Seeking relevant documents is one thing. But the notion that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; the former national security adviser John Bolton and others will come before the Senate and glibly pour out the true facts about Ukraine and the transparently false explanations by President Trump is a bit of a pipe dream.
Look back to what we've got from Attorney General William Barr; the former acting attorney general Matthew Whitaker; the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski; and the former special counsel Robert Mueller, for that matter, who when given the opportunity to enlighten Congress and the public on matters of importance, chose obfuscation or near silence.

Top Helmet Maker Losing Money Fast

Texto completo: Vicis, which has won more than $ 1 million in grants from the N.F.L. and makes helmets used by star quarterbacks like Russell Wilson and Patrick Mahomes, is running out of money.
Around Thanksgiving, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson received some news as unnerving as the sight of an all-out quarterback blitz.
The N.F.L. stars and other investors in Vicis, the heralded Seattle-based helmet maker, were officially informed that the company was running out of cash.
"Our employees are currently furloughed and we need to raise capital in order to continue operating, or we may have no other option but to wind down all operations," wrote Ralph Greene Jr., who took over as the new chief executive just days before, in a letter reviewed by The New York Times.
The plea for millions of dollars to cover basic expenses represents a startling fall for a company that has won plaudits for its high-tech helmets and raised more than $ 90 million from venture capital and some of the N.F.L.'s highest-profile players. The company, with a board that includes highly respected doctors, business leaders and military advisers, also secured $ 1.1 million in grants from the N.F.L., though the league does not have an ownership stake.
The financial crisis at Vicis highlights one of the biggest challenges in football's fight to make the game safer. Most brain scientists dismiss the idea that a new helmet can significantly reduce the risk of traumatic brain injuries and long-term brain damage.
Wilson, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and dozens of other players wear a Vicis helmet each Sunday. Shock absorbers inside the helmet have been shown to reduce the impact of direct hits and limit the rotational energy the head absorbs. So far, that has not been enough for Vicis to succeed.
Youth and high school football participation is falling, and the helmet business is dominated by Riddell and a handful of companies that are weighed down by insurance costs. Still, Vicis and other companies continue to try to develop better helmets for athletes and other commercial and military uses.
In its letter to investors, the company said it would try to raise additional money by selling shares that valued the company at just $ 5 million, compared with a $ 90 million valuation as recently as last year.
To stay afloat, Vicis plans to cut operating costs by half, curtail expansion plans and focus on just two football helmets -- its adult model and a version for children. Last month, the company's board pushed out its co-founder and chief executive, Dave Marver, who said in an email that the odds were stacked against newcomers to the helmet business, even those like Vicis that have seen growth.
"We were more successful than most at raising capital, but it took a tremendous amount of time and effort, effort that could have been applied to growing and running the business," Marver said.
The company expects to lose $ 26 million this year, according to internal Vicis documents. With its cash dwindling, it has struggled to fulfill some orders. The delivery of a few hundred helmets ordered by the upstart X.F.L. has been delayed. The new league is hoping the helmets will arrive by the start of training camps early next year, according to an X.F.L. official with direct knowledge of the transaction, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preserve the league's relationship with one of the few helmet manufacturers.
In a statement, Matt McKenna, a spokesman for Vicis, said the company is seeking another round of funding. He declined to comment further.
Vicis approached the helmet market in the fashion of Tesla, the automobile maker that sought to capture the high-end of the market first. Vicis targeted N.F.L. and college teams that can afford its premium prices. The helmets can cost as much as $ 1,500, at least double what most high-end helmets cost. Executives hoped the visibility among top athletes would help them sell to youth and high school teams.
But the challenges for a newcomer, even one with the support and star power of Vicis, are fierce, said Vin Ferrara, who founded and ran the helmet maker Xenith for almost a decade. There are liability and product maintenance costs, helmets that need to be customized for players and teams, and a limited market that tightens competition.
"It is entirely conceivable that even if a helmet were designed and tested such that it could undeniably claim it was better, it could fail as a commercial product," Ferrara said.
Still, Vicis appeared to have advantages. Two professors from the University of Washington and Marver, a veteran of the medical device business, launched the company in 2013. Its association with the N.F.L. and support from Commissioner Roger Goodell helped immensely.
"How do we use new materials, how do we use new technology to create a better helmet?" Goodell said at a fan forum in 2017 where he touted Vicis. "We have one that's hitting the market this year. It was developed by somebody in Seattle." In an interview last year, Marver said the backing of the N.F.L. had given Vicis credibility with the medical and equipment staffs of N.F.L. teams.
"They should be proud of the work they have done," Jeff Miller, the league's executive vice president for health and safety innovation, said of Vicis engineers in a statement issued on Monday. "It has contributed to a significant shift in the helmet manufacturing industry that benefits players at the professional level and beyond."
Another source of capital has been Rx3 Ventures, a consumer-focused investment fund based in California. Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers quarterback, is a partner. The private equity fund was an early investor in Vicis, even though Rodgers doesn't wear its helmets. (He wears a helmet from competitor Schutt.)
The Vicis board includes Richard Ellenbogen, a neurosurgeon in Seattle who was chairman of the league's Head, Neck and Spine Committee. Other players who have invested include the New York Giants receiver Golden Tate (who also wears the helmet), the former receiver Doug Baldwin, and Hall of Famers Jerry Rice and Roger Staubach.
The N.F.L. and the players union ranked the company's ZERO1 model at the top of its 2019 helmet rankings based on its ability to "reduce head impact severity." The outside of the ZERO1 is softer than other helmets and has columns that deform upon impact, helping distribute force more evenly than other helmets do.
However, according to the N.F.L., helmets from Vicis competitors Riddell, Schutt and Xenith are about as good. The league noted in its testing that some two dozen approved helmets also performed well in testing, with "no statistical difference in performance from the three top-ranked helmets."
The company has said that about 7 percent of N.F.L. players wear the ZERO1, and the company has begun equipping college players. The first Vicis expansion into colleges, with the University of Oregon and University of Washington, led to complaints from players about the fit.
The cost of developing Vicis's technology has far outpaced the sale of new helmets. The company expects to take in $ 14.2 million in revenue in 2019, according to financial reports reviewed by The Times, about $ 3 million less than the cost of producing its helmets. Costs associated with sales, marketing and research and development are expected to push the losses to $ 25.9 million this year.
The company anticipates even less revenue next year, but because of a dramatic cost-cutting, it forecasts a loss of $ 9 million.
Before he was pushed out, Marver had to scramble for more money.
"It's always difficult for a company making football helmets to raise capital given the industry's risks and competitive dynamics," Marver said. "Most institutional investors won't engage at all."
According to notices filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company in July tried to raise $ 10 million, but was only able to come up with $ 2.1 million. The company had to pay a broker $ 112,000 to find these additional investors.

Texto completo: The thought first occurred to me five weeks ago, while watching the Oakland Raiders’ pass rush treat Philip Rivers like one of those inflatable pop-up dolls – you know, you keep knocking it down, and it keeps bouncing right back up – on the field at whatever they’re calling the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum these days.
It continued to nag at me during all of these weeks the Chargers have been on the road. It kept coming to mind Sunday, when they returned home to play before what would be conservatively estimated as 70 percent Minnesota Vikings fans, at the same time the Raiders were making their own melancholy farewell appearance in Oakland.
Today then, a few days before the Raiders and a chunk of their immense SoCal fan base play the Chargers in Carson, it’s time for some alternate history.
What would have happened, at that fateful NFL league meeting in January 2016 when Stan Kroenke’s fellow owners approved the Rams’ move to L.A. and his Inglewood stadium project, if those owners had given the Raiders the first option to become Kroenke’s tenant, rather than the Chargers?
We start this musing with an opinion that I’d maintained throughout the two decades of the league’s absence from L.A., when the city was no more than a stalking horse for other owners seeking stadium deals in their own cities: If and when a team finally set up shop here, it would have to deal with that huge segment of fans who refused to abandon the Silver and Black even after Al Davis moved the Raiders back to their ancestral home in 1995.
Those are the people you’ve seen in the Southwest Airlines terminals of area airports on Saturdays (or Sunday mornings) of Raiders home game weekends the last 25 seasons, flying up to the games and flying back afterward. Some are clad in their Black Hole costumes, and I’m guessing TSA employees have to remind themselves: These aren’t security risks, these are Raider fans.
(Feel free to insert your own one-liner here.)
Their commutes will be shorter beginning next season when the Raiders move into the $2 billion Allegiant Stadium near the Las Vegas strip.
But stay with me here: What if the Raiders had wound up in L.A. … and the Chargers had wound up in Vegas, a virgin territory with no previous NFL allegiances beyond monetary ones? It’s not that far-fetched.
From the Raiders’ standpoint, I’m guessing they would have found an immediate home somewhere in SoCal. Probably not the Coliseum, likely not the Rose Bowl, but possibly Dodger or Angel Stadium as a short-term abode. They would have had no trouble filling it with their own loyal (and eccentrically costumed) fans, while the Rams would still have been able to rebuild their SoCal fan base in much the same manner they have. There would be less snark about L.A. as an NFL town, and when the Inglewood stadium was ready the new occupants would be on relatively equal footing.
(You think the Raiders aren’t still strong here? There are still Raider Image stores at Universal Citywalk and in Moreno Valley, and the team’s fan club directory lists nine different booster clubs in SoCal, from Fillmore to Hesperia and including two in San Diego.)
But what of the Chargers?
Before I continue, I am fully aware that this column will likely draw a call or a text from the Chargers’ sharp vice president of public relations, Josh Rupprecht, asking what his franchise did to deserve this, and is it really a bad thing that the Chargers are here? We realize this is considered a long-term project to build a fan base. But three years in, you have to wonder if this market – the most diverse, and fickle, in North America – just might be too tough to crack.
Certainly, people in the NFL offices in New York are noticing. And the reports of friction between the Chargers and Rams involving the new stadium, now a $5 billion (and rising) project, don’t help the optics.
The Las Vegas component will not thrill our friends in San Diego, but consider the history of these moves.
When Mark Davis and the Raiders romanced Las Vegas early in 2016, no more than a couple of weeks after (a) their joint project with the Chargers on a new Carson stadium was shot down and (b) the Chargers got the first option to join Kroenke’s project with a year to exercise it, the man who arranged the Raiders-Vegas talks was Mark Fabiani. That is the same Fabiani who is still listed in the Chargers’ organizational chart as a special counsel to controlling owner Dean Spanos, and the same Fabiani who was in charge of the team’s stadium quest in San Diego.
Also, in many eyes – including these two – it’s the same Fabiani who torpedoed any chance of cooperation between Spanos’ organization and the politicians of San Diego with an uncompromising, hardball negotiating style that ultimately led to a total breakdown of relationships with city officials and the fans themselves. The moment the Chargers began openly seeking other alternatives was the moment the San Diego public began to turn away from Spanos and his team.
Fabiani later signed on as an advisor to Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, and it was through that relationship that Mark Davis was introduced to Adelson and the wheels began to turn toward the Raiders’ move to Nevada.
So, in our alternate history, it is entirely reasonable that having been shut out of L.A., Spanos turns his attention north on I-15, with Fabiani smoothing the way for the Chargers in the same way he made things happen for the Raiders.
Those bridge years might still have been spent in San Diego, and it’s possible the composition of crowds in that city would resemble what they are now in Carson. But Las Vegas would ultimately have been a far more hospitable destination for the Chargers, as a one-team town hungry for football. Spanos would have been a hero, rather than an interloper (as he’s considered by many in L.A.) or villain (in San Diego).
Plus it’s a lot closer than London, where reports earlier this season had the Chargers ultimately landing followed by Spanos’ vehement denial.
Instead, back in the real world, this is what we have: Minnesota Vikings fans dominating Dignity Health Sports Park this past Sunday, just like Green Bay Packers fans before them, and Pittsburgh Steelers fans, Denver Broncos fans, Houston Texans fans and Indianapolis Colts fans before that in 2019. It has to be discouraging for players and coaches who never get to play before a true home crowd.
The move to the bigger SoFi Stadium will not be a panacea – it’s more seats available for opposition fans, if anything – and while there will be an attempt to put the teams on equal footing in the shared stadium, it will be hard to forget that Kroenke is the owner and Spanos is the renter.
Meanwhile, SoCal Raiders fans will continue to flock to LAX, Burbank, Ontario, Long Beach and John Wayne airports to catch flights for their favorite team’s home games, or else will make the drive up I-15. As colleague Mark Whicker once observed, it’ll be like eight more championship fights a year in ‘Vegas.
An example: The New York Times quoted Ruben Maya, a law enforcement officer from Riverside who paid $12,000 for two personal seat licenses and $3,000 for 2020 season tickets for Raiders games in Vegas: “I live a six-hour drive from Oakland, but it’s only a 3-1/2 hour drive to Las Vegas. I’m going to come to every home game the first season.”
And, as has been the case for years, the Raiders’ ninth home game will come on the Chargers’ home field. There will be a preview Sunday afternoon.

Liberal Media Scream: New York Times' columnist demands impeachment ‘to preserve America'

Texto completo: This week’s Liberal Media Scream features celebrated New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman declaring that only impeaching President Trump will preserve the nation.
In a “Point-CounterPoint” segment on CBS’s Sunday Morning, Friedman declared: “President Trump not only should be impeached, he must be impeached, if we’re to preserve America as we’ve known it.”
iFrame Object
Responding to Eliana Johnson of the Washington Free Beacon, who argued against impeaching Trump, Friedman began his counterpoint:
“President Trump not only should be impeached, he must be impeached, if we’re to preserve America as we’ve known it. Of course, ideally, presidents should be removed by the will of voters through elections. But, Eliana, when I hear Trump defenders say impeachment would subvert that process, I say: ‘Really? What the hell do you think Trump was doing?’ He was subverting the will of the people by using our tax dollars to force Ukraine to investigate his most feared opponent, Joe Biden, in the next election, rather than trusting voters to do that.
“If we say, as Republicans are, that what Trump did is not impeachable, we are telling ourselves and every future president, ‘Hey, it’s okay to enlist a foreign power to tilt the election your way.’ Can you imagine how much cash future candidates could raise from Saudi Arabia or how many cyber warriors they could enlist from Russia to tilt future elections? The sanctity of our elections would be shot, and we’d never again have a president, who, whether or not you liked him or her, was at least seen as legitimately elected.”
Brent Baker, Media Research Center vice president of research, explains our weekly pick: “Friedman is certainly in high dudgeon with his claim that ‘to preserve America as we’ve known it,’ President Trump must be impeached, as if not impeaching Trump will ruin the country. He’d have more credibility to pass such moral judgment if he’d not shown over the top disdain for Trump since Trump was elected. ‘This is a moral 9/11. Only 9/11 was done to us from the outside, and we did this to ourselves,’ Friedman told Bill Maher three days after the 2016 vote.
Rating: Four out of five screams.

Bloomberg, Booker, and Castro may make February debates if rule changes go through

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidates unlikely to make the January debate stage may get a reprieve from pending rules changes that could clear the way for Cory Booker, Michael Bloomberg, and Julian Castro to participate.
Tom Perez, Democratic National Committee chair, told the New York Times that both a polling and donor threshold for debate qualification will remain in place for the Jan. 14 debate in Iowa, a blow to the eight candidates who failed to meet the mark for the December round and have a lower chance of meeting it for the January round.
Booker, a New Jersey senator, and eight other presidential candidates — seven who qualified for the December debate plus Castro, a former housing secretary — signed a letter sent to the DNC on Saturday urging the committee to change the bar for qualification to either a donor threshold or a polling threshold rather than both.
“The escalating thresholds over the past few months have unnecessarily and artificially narrowed what started as the strongest and most diverse Democratic field in history before voters have had a chance to be heard,” the letter read.
Participation for the December debate required candidates to secure 200,000 donors plus meet a polling threshold of either 4% support in four DNC-approved primary polls or 6% support in two early state polls. Debate requirements have steadily increased for the six debates in 2016, but Perez did not say whether the DNC would again raise the bar for January.
Booker, Castro, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard met the December donor threshold but did not secure the required polls. Five other candidates did not meet either metric: Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, Bloomberg, former Maryland Rep. John Delaney, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, and spiritual author Marianne Williamson.
There could be hope for the candidates to make the three debates scheduled in February, though. Perez said he might eliminate the thresholds or use results from early state nominating contests as a new qualifying threshold.
Eliminating a donor threshold is the only way that Bloomberg, a billionaire and former New York mayor, could participate in the debates because he is self-funding his campaign and not accepting outside donations.
Perez said that he hears complaints about debate rules from both sides.
“I’ve had days where I’ve gotten calls, literally, one after another, from person A, who I have great respect for, who said, ‘You’ve got to help. We need a narrower field,’” Perez said. “Then person B calls saying, ‘The field is too narrow.’”

Covington 2: Newsrooms falsely accuse West Point cadets of flashing ‘white supremacy’ symbol

Texto completo: Here we go again. Call it the sequel to the Covington Catholic scandal.
West Point cadets were seen this weekend on national television playing the “circle game,” an old schoolyard pastime where a person makes a circle with his thumb and index finger and then punches whomever he tricks into looking at it. But certain journalists and pundits did not see cadets merely playing a silly game before the Army-Navy football game. Rather, members of our very serious and reasonable news media saw cadets flashing the “OK” hand gesture supposedly owned by white supremacists.
Clearly, we have learned nothing from the Covington Catholic fiasco, an especially shameful episode in media malpractice for which several publications now face multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuits.
The jarringly stupid Army-Navy episode begins with an obscure Twitter user, @BruthaManTho, who tweeted photos of ESPN’s broadcast with the accompanying commentary, “Just wanted to enjoy the #ArmyNavy. Didn’t expect or want to see the White Power symbol thrown up by cadets on national television.”
The person added, “They are well aware of what they are doing and think it’s funny. Disgusting. … nothing like seeing a bunch of cadets throwing up the white power symbol on national television.”Tweet
The tweets soon went viral, creating an entire news cycle based around the laugh-out-loud assertion that cadets playing the "circle game" had displayed “white power” symbols on national television.

The New York Times, for example, published an article on the incident on Sunday explaining how the "OK" hand gesture has "became a fraught one.”

This is so stupid. I genuinely resent everyone for making me explain this.

First, the “OK” symbol that members of the press and activist groups attribute to white supremacists started as a joke. Trolls on the internet thought it would be funny to trick the broader media into believing that a universally accepted hand gesture was part of a secret code used by white supremacists (the New York Times article mentions all of this). The “OK” gesture then became an inside joke among actual white supremacists, which resulted in activist groups and the press declaring the innocuous symbol off-limits for everyone.
In other words, the "OK" sign is "fraught" because the targets of a joke campaign by online trolls say so.

Secondly, the “OK” hand gesture attributed to white supremacists is right-side up (fingers pointing upwards). The hand gestures seen on national television this weekend at the Army-Navy game show the cadets’ hands pointing downward and sideways because they are playing the “circle game,” not pledging their allegiance to white supremacy, you unbelievable idiots.

Amazingly, the United States Naval Academy and United States Military Academy have launched separate investigations into their cadets. The media, meanwhile, are treating the story as though they're near-certain the students flashed "white supremacist" symbols on television.

NBC News, for example, reports that military officials are looking into "what appeared to be white supremacist hand signs" made by students before the Army-Navy football game on Saturday.

Then there is the “Facts First” crowd over at CNN.

“A lot of people saw this as it was happening in real-time," said host John Berman. "Very serious questions."

Erica Hill called the incident, “Troubling.”

Later, host Dave Briggs noted that the Anti-Defamation League “does consider the OK gesture a hate crime in some cases.” Briggs then revealed that CNN would not "show the gesture.”

“Even the notion of it is very disturbing,” said CNN’s Dana Bash.

Then there those in the news media who saved their reactions for Twitter, which is home to just some of the dumbest people alive.

David Johnston, whose Twitter biography boasts of his 53 years of investigative reporting, asked of the West Point and Naval Academy superintendents, “Are you going to discipline the cadets & midshipmen who flashed white power signs at the Army Navy game? Note: video shows they timed their racist hand signals to make sure they’d appear on the Jumbotron. Expulsion?”

“White power symbols,” said NFL columnist Mike Freeman. “From Army cadets. Knowing they are on live television. Trump emboldens this trash. He absolutely does. These guys should be kicked out immediately.”

Another sportswriter, Nathan Bernhardt, expressed irritation that anyone would suggest that the cadets had not actually flashed symbols of white supremacy, writing, "are we all still doing that 'oh they're only throwing up that sign because YOU think it's associated with white supremacy, don't let them troll you' thing or have people grown up.”

“Whatever it used to mean,” said CNN contributing opinion writer Jeff Yang, “this symbol used in this fashion is now indelibly associated with white supremacist individuals and agendas, and these cadets are making it on national TV, behind the head of a cadet of color.”

Put another way: Even if they didn't mean it, they're still guilty.

In January, newsrooms rushed to accuse a group of Covington Catholic students of racism when an abbreviated video of the teenagers' confrontation with an elderly Native American protester went viral. It turns out the students were innocent and that they did none of the things of which they were accused. It has not even been one year, and the exact same story is playing out all over again with the media blindly rushing to accuse obscure nobodies of overt bigotry. The only things that have changed between the January incident and now are the names and locations.

“Los cerdos salvajes son destructivos de muchas maneras, impactan varios sectores”, dijo al diario neoyorquino Dale Nolte, en referencia al daño que pueden hacer en las poblaciones de aves, anfibios y reptiles .
Los animales son descendientes de los jabalíes que trajeron los conquistadores europeos , quienes los usaban para tener presas de caza y alimentarse. Con el paso del tiempo se mezclaron con los cerdos de granjas que se escapaban.
El reporte dice que los animales han sido llevados por humanos desde Texas a otros estados con el fin de estimular a los cazadores. El problema es que son especies bastante prolíficas. Una hembra puede tener dos partos de seis crías por año.
En Canadá también fueron traídos para la caza en la década de los ochenta. Se creyó que no iban a resistir el invierno, pero expertos comprobaron que los cerdos aprendieron a hacer madrigueras para aislarse del frío. Otros han desarrollado pieles gruesas.
El gobierno de Estados Unidos hace seguimiento a la situación en la frontera norte y respondería con un ataque aéreo contra los animales.
Los cerdos son portadores de al menos 33 enfermedades , entre ellas la tuberculosis bovina. A los animales se les culpa de los brotes de E. Coli en lechuga y espinaca ya que los cerdos estarían defecando en las granjas.

Reports: Van Drew to become Republican

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Jeff Van Drew, Democrat who was elected in last year's "blue wave" in South Jersey's Second Congressional District, plans to switch parties and become a Republican, according to multiple national news organizations.
The New York Times reported Saturday afternoon that Van Drew, a moderate Democrat who is opposed to the impeachment of President Donald Trump, "told aides on Saturday that he is planning to switch parties and declare himself a Republican as soon as next week, just as the House is casting its historic votes on articles of impeachment."
A former state legislator, Van Drew, 66, of Dennis Township in Cape May, was elected in the November 2018 midterms which resulted in the defeat of every Republican for federal office but U.S. Rep. Chris Smith, who was left as the lone GOP member of New Jersey's congressional delegation earlier this year.
Van Drew's district includes all of Cape May, Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties, parts of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester counties and a portion of southern Ocean County.
He succeeded U.S. Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican who had served in the U.S. House of Representatives for 24 years before he retired with the last election.
Politico reported Saturday Van Drew was one of two Democrats who voted against opening the impeachment inquiry and that he remained against the effort, even as the House prepares to vote on articles of impeachment next week.
"The stunning move comes amid new polling that shows Van Drew's approval ratings are under water with Democratic voters in his district," Politico reported. "According to a survey conducted between Dec. 7 and Dec. 10, just 24 percent of respondents think he deserves to be reelected, while 60 percent said they want someone new to represent them."
The New York Times and Politico both reported that Van Drew went to see Trump at the White House on Friday.
The congressman "sought Trump's blessing for the move, which could be critical to his ability to avoid a primary challenge next year, and the president urged him to make the jump, according to two Democrats and one Republican who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the talks," the Times reported.
Gov. Phil Murphy slammed the congressman in a series of tweets on Saturday night, writing that Van Drew "has chosen his political career over our Constitution. Despite knowing full well that the President has abused the powers of his office, he's now willing to enable Donald Trump just to try to salvage his own election."
Ocean County Freeholder Director Virginia E. Haines, who is also a member of the Republican National Committee, said she was not aware of Van Drew's plans to become a Republican, but that she was not surprised.
Haines said that because Van Drew could not support the march of his caucus toward impeachment, as a Democrat, he would have alienated his party's base going into an election year and energized Republican support for a challenger in a congressional district that already leans Republican.

Sarah Broom remembers Hurricane Katrina in "The Yellow House"

Texto completo: One of the most striking moments in Sarah M. Broom's enthralling memoir, "The Yellow House," comes near its end. Broom's indomitable mother, Ivory Mae Broom, was born and raised in New Orleans, as were her 12 children. Broom describes Ivory Mae staying overnight in her daughter's apartment in the city's iconic French Quarter: "'I'm seventy-one,' she announced from the balcony the day after I moved in. 'And this is the first time I'm sleeping in the French Quarter.'"
If, like many visitors, you think the French Quarter is New Orleans, Broom has another story to tell you. It is a rich and deep one, not just the story of her own life (though that is a rich enough tale) but the story of several generations of her family and of the city that is indelibly their home, both before and after what Broom calls the Water.
The Water, of course, is Hurricane Katrina, the devastating storm that inundated the city in 2005, and from which it has not fully recovered. The French Quarter had minimal damage, but some neighborhoods, like New Orleans East, the site of the Broom family home that gives the book its title, were all but erased from the map.
New Orleans East, Broom tells us, often didn't show up on maps of the city even before Katrina. Wedged between the Industrial Canal, the Intracoastal Waterway and Lake Pontchartrain, it's the newest part of one of the oldest U.S. cities, hopefully promoted as suburbs in the 1960s. Ivory Mae bought her shotgun house on Wilson Avenue in 1961 for $3,200, when she was a 19-year-old widow. (Her first husband was hit by a car as he walked along a road near the Army base where he was stationed.) She had two children and another on the way.
The house needed work; by the time Ivory Mae moved in three years later, she had married her second husband, Simon Broom Sr. Each of them had three children from first marriages, and they would have six together. Sarah is the youngest, born 30 years after her oldest sibling.
She begins the book long before her own arrival, recounting the lives of her siblings, parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. Throughout the book, that family history is interwoven with the history of New Orleans East, which goes from an integrated suburb to a largely black neighborhood that was already beginning to turn into an industrial district before the Water.
Broom writes lovingly but unsentimentally about her family's complex relationships. Ivory Mae is for years a devoted stay-at-home mom, a meticulous housekeeper and fine cook who sews all the clothes for her family. Simon works in the maintenance department at the nearby NASA installation and is as devoted to their family as Ivory Mae is.
But six months after Sarah is born, Simon dies at 56 of an aneurysm, leaving Ivory Mae a widow for the second time at 39. Some of her children will go to college, others will go to prison. Over time, the Yellow House she was so proud of will deteriorate, with too little money or time to make repairs.
And then, the Water. By 2005 Broom was living in Harlem, working as a journalist. About half of her family still lived in New Orleans, and most, including Ivory Mae, fled the storm, in three different directions.
But Sarah's brother Carl would stay in the Yellow House as it drowned, armed with an ax to chop his way out when the attic flooded. He perched on the roof with his two Pekingese dogs, occasionally swimming down the street to check on other stranded residents, until rescuers arrived seven days after the flood.
Broom writes movingly about how her siblings reach out to help each other and their mother, and about the traumas that don't entirely heal. Their grandmother dies not long after the storm, and few people come to her funeral because the family is unable to put an obituary in the Times-Picayune; they make dozens of phone calls but in the flood's wake, "the line stayed busy; no one ever answered."
Broom, too, has a dramatic emotional response, even though she was far away from the storm. She quits her magazine job and goes to Burundi (a sort of African New Orleans East that few Americans can readily locate) to work for a nonprofit for several months.
Then she jumps back into New Orleans with both feet, working as a speechwriter for Mayor Ray Nagin during storm recovery. She ping-pongs back to New York, then to that apartment in the French Quarter, sandwiched between former residences of Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner, still wrestling with her own identity.
Along the way, Ivory Mae struggles with mountains of paperwork to try to repair and return to her beloved Yellow House, but it will meet a melancholy fate.
Broom's writing has appeared in the New Yorker, Oxford American, O magazine and the New York Times Magazine. This memoir is her first book; in November it won the National Book Award for nonfiction.
"The Yellow House" is the story of a uniquely American family and a uniquely American city, beautifully told.

Trump 'Merry Christmas' rally to take place in Battle Creek

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said.
"This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news about the rally was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner on Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession.
"The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College / New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017.
His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18.
Tickets are available online at donaldjtrump.com/events/ battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

Your guide to all 'The Nutcrackers' in Phoenix

Texto completo: You don't have to be a ballet lover to love "The Nutcracker." The classical Russian ballet became an American holiday tradition in the 1950s and '60s, and if you've ever accompanied a 6-year-old to a performance, you understand why.
The story is as simple as it gets. A girl gets a gift on Christmas Eve. She falls asleep. She dreams a magical adventure with a handsome prince. She wakes up, but the sense of wonder remains.
Yes, it can be old-fashioned, but the combination of cartoonish whimsy and physical grace that seems to defy the laws of physics is pure magic, and Tchaikovsky's music is irresistibly cheerful.
Here are six ways to introduce youngsters to "The Nutcracker" in metro Phoenix.
1. Ballet Arizona Ballet Arizona spent $1.8 million in 2006 dollars on this lavish staging by acclaimed choreographer Ib Andersen, and it was named one of the three best regional productions in the country by the New York Times. Highlights include the Snow Queen scene, with dancers moving through a cyclone of snowflakes against a nighttime skyscape lit up with gleaming crystals. Modern twists include humorous nods to pop culture. Tickets can be spendy, though. Be sure to search for discount options such as goldstar.com.
Details: Dec. 13-24. Symphony Hall, 75 N. Second St., Phoenix. $39 and up. 602-381-1096, balletaz.org.
2. Phoenix Ballet Led by Slawomir Wozniak, a former principal dancer for the National Opera in his native Poland, Phoenix Ballet is basically a pro-am company, pairing top student talent from Wozniak's Master Ballet Academy with professional ringers. The overall feel is pretty traditional, but the production values are high and the choreography (punctuated by the occasional acrobatic run) is fun and modern.
Details: Dec. 12-23. Orpheum Theatre, 203 W. Adams St., Phoenix. $25-$90. 602-996-8000, phoenixballet.org.
3. Ballet schools There are, of course, many student performances around the Valley, including at public schools. It's the biggest showcase of the year for dance academies such as Ballet Etudes, which is notching its 33rd annual production. Here's a sampling of local ballet schools. You can search online for others.
Southwest Ballet Theatre: Dec. 12-15. Estrella Mountain Community College Performing Arts Center, 3000 N. Dysart Road, Avondale. $18-$24. southwestballettheatre.org.
Southwest Youth Ballet: Dec. 13-15. Higley Center for the Performing Arts, 4132 E. Pecos Road, Gilbert. $10-$30. 480-279-7194, higleycenter.org.
Ahwatukee Foothills Ballet: Dec. 14-15. Desert Vista Fine Arts Theatre, 16440 S. 32nd St., Phoenix. $20-$40. afnutcracker.com.
Ballet Etudes: Dec. 14-22. Mesa Arts Center, 1 E. Main St. $28-$32. 480-644-6500, mesaartscenter.com.
4. 'Marie's Reverie' Speaking of grass roots, Glendale's Brelby Theatre Company is a mom-and-pop shop (Shelby and Brian Maticic built their own theater in a big old house) that makes the most of its modest budget. They also serve up original shows, including this "dance-infused fantasy play" that mashes up "The Nutcracker" and Hans Christian Andersen's "Snow Queen."
Details: Through Dec. 21. Brelby Playhouse, 7154 N. 58th Drive, Glendale. $20-$25. 623-282-2781, brelby.com.
5. At the movies: Bolshoi Ballet Founded the same year as the U.S.A. (1776), the Bolshoi is the most famous ballet company in the world, and its "Nutcracker" comes to movie theaters Sunday, Dec. 15. An encore screening of a live performance, it features dancer principal Semyon Chudin and Margarita Shrainer, who went from understudy to prima ballerina practically overnight.
Details: 12:55 p.m. Sunday. Dec. 15. Find locations at fathomevents.com.
6. Streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Finally, you can find several versions of "The Nutcracker" on streaming video services. Netflix has Disney's "The Nutcracker and the Four Realms" (kind of a generic fantasy, but with a mini-ballet featuring a cameo by Misty Copeland), but for the real thing, Amazon Prime has the most offer, including a 1977 TV performance with Mikhail Baryshnikov and a 1986 staging with designs by Maurice Sendak.

Texto completo: When U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren released her plan to rein in Wall Street earlier this year, she said she wanted to stop investors from "bleeding the company dry and walking away enriched even as the company succumbs."
Warren, of course, leans to the far left and has been on the attack against Big Business for years. But conservatives voice similar concerns. In a segment last week, Fox News host Tucker Carlson lambasted a model of "ruthless economic efficiency: Buy a distressed company, outsource the jobs, liquidate the valuable assets, fire middle management, and once the smoke has cleared, dump what remains to the highest bidder, often in Asia."
While Warren and Carlson are correct to worry about the excesses of business -- and there are bad actors -- populist CliffsNotes about business overlook some of the major reasons business decisions are made.
Warren cherry picks a few examples of where private equity investors have failed to turn around struggling companies, and her solution is to change the tax code and force partners and investors to be liable for debt and pension costs -- measures that threaten the entire existence of the private equity industry.
But private equity is an overall positive for the economy, often serving as a last resort to save struggling companies that could otherwise shut down entirely.
Research has shown that private equity-backed businesses were better equipped to weather the last financial crisis. Another recent study demonstrated that while jobs are often lost in the immediate aftermath of a private equity acquisition, companies eventually add jobs and increase productivity.
Meanwhile, Carlson's TV segment focused on outdoor retailer Cabela's. He blames a hedge fund, Elliott Management, for wrecking the company and destroying the small town of Sidney, Nebraska, where Cabela's had its headquarters. Carlson paints Cabela's as a healthy company making $1 billion per year, and if it hadn't been for a hedge fund forcing a merger with rival Bass Pro Shops, the company would have continued its success.
The rosy picture painted doesn't match with reality. In the three years leading up to the sale, Cabela's operating income -- a company's key profitability measure -- was down 24% and falling. The company's founder, Dick Cabela, had passed away in 2014, and the Cabela family was not significantly involved in management. In fact, members of the family had been steadily selling stock on the open market and were already considering the more efficient path of selling the entire company. At the time, a sale was looking increasingly like a good strategic move to keep the company running and maintain as many as possible of its nearly 20,000 jobs.
The sale to Bass Pro was not the best outcome. I wrote in 2016 of the tragedy that would occur if Bass Pro was the buyer. Mergers can create efficiencies and streamline operations, but they can also devastate local communities. In this case, I explained before the sale of Cabela's that merging with Bass Pro Shops would devastate Sidney and cost a town of 6,800 people 2,000 jobs.
What would have presented a better alternative was a sale to a private equity fund. The acquirer would have retooled how the company did business and some jobs would have been lost, but importantly, Sidney would have assumed far less of the burden.
Private equity is often very eager to take over retailers in distress, and while it was doing poorly, Cabela's was healthier than a lot of other retailers seeking private equity buyouts. The big buyout firms should have been eager to put in bids for Cabela's. Many of them had shown interest when Cabela's first began to consider a sale, but that dried up.
Why? Anti-gun sentiment scared them away. According to the New York Times, the New York City employee pension fund was threatening to withdraw its money from any private equity fund that bought Cabela's. This was part of a larger push by anti-gun advocates to divest of any company associated with firearms. Other large public pension funds were likely to follow suit. While Cabela's could have been a profitable investment for private equity, pension funds pulling their capital would have been too costly to bear.
It's unfortunate that gun divestment activists, and anti-private equity politicians for that matter, fail to understand the consequences of their policies. How many guns were taken off the market as a result of New York City's divestment threats? None. Markets will still allocate capital, but that allocation will be less efficient. In this case, Bass Pro was still there to make the purchase. But without the divestment campaign, it is likely that a private equity firm would have purchased Cabela's and preserved jobs in Sidney.
The bigger lesson to consider here is what happens to an economy when politicians try to change how capital is allocated. If Warren forces a massive rollback of the private equity industry, other businesses will face the same fate as Cabela's. Private equity won't be there to buy struggling companies. So instead, less efficient capital allocations will cost jobs and economic growth.

Texto completo: As the largest protests in weeks rocked Hong Kong last Sunday, with hundreds of thousands filling downtown streets, I was struck by the simple statement from Alice Wong, 24, a biology researcher, a protester among the many in the city’s Victoria Park: “We don’t want to become like China.”
That’s it. Well, she also told a New York Times reporter the obvious intertwined truth in what the mostly young constant demonstrators are after: “We want Hong Kong to continue being Hong Kong.”
That is, she wants her city-state, the former British colony, to continue being culturally Chinese in the broader sense of the diaspora, in the way that Singapore is Chinese — but not; that vast parts of Kuala Lumpur are Chinese — but not; that, well, Arcadia is Chinese — but not.
A heritage, common tongues, an entrepreneurial bent — but without the snooping authoritarian leadership with which the Communist Party has merely replaced the ancient Chinese landlord class in a political system that is anything but communal.
If the plutocrats in Beijing were smart about it, were able to let go of their manic goal of roping all the billions of Chinese peoples in the world into one system, they would realize letting Hong Kong be Hong Kong — letting Taiwan be Taiwan, for that matter — would be by far the best thing for the Mainland as well. That way they don’t have to move toward systems like those in HK and Taipei and Singapore that are mildly democratic, with a few more civil liberties. They can let the broader Chinese nation let off a little steam of freedom without becoming more open themselves.
Instead, the People’s Republic has to control all things in the territories of its growing empire, even if that means putting a million Uighur Muslims in concentration camps.
I wish I could say that it was remotely possible to foresee a successful end game in the Hong Kong kids’ mass marches. But I can’t. As there’s something in a scorpion’s nature that leads it to sting, there’s something in Beijing’s emperors that won’t broach dissent. Sooner or later they’ll send in the People’s Army to put down the actual people.
But it’s not just Chinese people Beijing wants to control. It’s the rest of us, too.
Pasadena lawyer Rob O’Brien, President Trump’s new national security advisor, came back to town last week to speak at a defense forum.
Outside it, he gave an interview to NPR from which I was very happy to find he’s leading the administration’s anti-China world domination wing by detailing the dangers of other nations allowing the Chinese telecommunications company Huawei to build the internet’s new 5G networks:
“So every medical record, every social media post, every email, every financial transaction, and every citizen of the country with cloud computing and artificial intelligence can be sucked up out of Huawei into massive servers in China,” O’Brien told NPR.
Inside the meeting, he kept up the theme, telling defense industry and military officials: “This isn’t a theoretical threat.”
It’s not. And, as if in some over-the-top parody of international bad guys, China’s leaders are coming after your kids, too. TikTok, that latest fad you don’t understand, is the most-downloaded app this year, featuring 15-second videos mostly shared by young people. Here’s how Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, puts it: “A company compromised by the Chinese Communist Party knows where your children are, knows what they look like, what their voices sound like, what they’re watching and what they share with each other.” If that sounds like a real-life “The Man in the High Castle” world, then I suggest we join the HK kids, and protest.

Court Will Decide if Much of Oklahoma Belongs to the Indians

Texto completo: The court was poised to decide the question in its last term but appeared to have deadlocked.
The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether much of eastern Oklahoma is an Indian reservation, a question that could have enormous consequences for the area's 1.8 million residents in matters of criminal justice and commerce.
The court tried to resolve the question in a different case in its last term, but it appeared to have deadlocked 4 to 4. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch had recused himself from the case, which was an appeal from a decision of the court on which he once sat, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver.
On the last day of the Supreme Court's earlier term, on June 27, the court said it would hear another set of arguments in that case, Sharp v. Murphy, No. 17-1107, in its new term, which started in October.
But that has not happened, and it was not clear that another argument would break the deadlock so long as the court remained short-handed.
The court appears to have decided to hear the new case, McGirt v. Oklahoma, No. 18-9526, an appeal from a state court's decision, to ensure that the issue could be decided by a nine-member court.
The new case concerns Jimcy McGirt, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation who was convicted of sex crimes against a child by state authorities in the Nation's historic boundaries.
Drawing on the 10th Circuit's decision in Patrick Murphy's case, Mr. McGirt argued that only the federal government could prosecute him.
At the argument of Mr. Murphy's case last year, Lisa S. Blatt, a lawyer for the state, said Congress had long ago destroyed the Creek Nation's authority over the land in question, meaning that state prosecutions are proper. She said the Creek Nation's authority had been severely curtailed by the federal government around the time Oklahoma became a state in 1907, incorporating lands that previously had been officially designated as Indian Territory.
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said that it was a little late to raise the idea that half of Oklahoma is an Indian reservation.
"There's a fundamental principle of law that derives from Sherlock Holmes, which is the dog that didn't bark," he said. "And how can it be that none of this was recognized by anybody or asserted by the Creek Nation, as far as I'm aware, for 100 years?"
But Ian H. Gershengorn, a lawyer for Mr. Murphy, said the tribe had continued to exercise sovereignty after Oklahoma became a state.
The justices scrutinized the consequences of a ruling in Mr. Murphy's favor. Edwin S. Kneedler, a lawyer for the federal government, arguing in favor of Oklahoma, said they would be vast.
"Any crime involving an Indian as a victim or a perpetrator would be subject to federal jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction," he said. That would, he said, strain the resources of the F.B.I. and federal prosecutors.
The state also would not be able to impose taxes on Native Americans, he added, and many other ordinary laws could be affected.
"This would be a dramatic change from the way everyone has understood it for the past 100 years," Mr. Kneedler said.

Russell Simmons urges Oprah Winfrey to stop #MeToo documentary about him

Texto completo: Russell Simmons is speaking out against Oprah Winfrey and her upcoming AppleTV+ documentary, which reportedly details allegations of sexual misconduct against the music mogul.
Simmons, 62, took to Instagram Friday to once again passionately deny the allegations and address Winfrey, whom he called a "shining light to my family and my community" and someone "contributing so much to my life that I couldn't list a fraction of it in this blog. "
"This is why it’s so troubling that you choose me to single out in your recent (documentary)," he continued. "I have already admitted to being a playboy more (appropriately titled today 'womanizer') sleeping with and putting myself in more compromising situations than almost any man I know. "
"Not 8 or 14 thousand like Warren Beatty or Wilt Chamberlain, but still an embarrassing number," he added. "So many that some could reinterpret or reimagine a different recollection of the same experiences. "
Fashion publicist Kelly Cutrone says Russell Simmons attempted to rape her in 1991
Over a dozen women have come forward with allegations against Simmons, with one unidentified woman filing a $10 million lawsuit in March of 2018 accusing him of rape. The lawsuit is pending after Simmons tried and failed to get it dismissed in August. A California judge ruled that Simmons did not supply sufficient evidence to support his claim that the statute of limitations on the alleged rape had run out.
Last week, Variety reported Winfrey's Apple Plus documentary will focus on "a former music executive who grapples with whether to go public with her story of assault and abuse by a notable figure in the industry. "
The next day, the Los Angeles Times reported Winfrey's documentary, which will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, features Drew Dixon, who alleges Simmons raped her in 1995. According to Simmons, Winfrey's producers said the documentary focuses on three "hand-chosen women. "
In 2017 the New York Times reported that Drew Dixon was working her dream job in 1995 as an executive at Def Jam Recordings, which Simmons co-founded. She said the mogul regularly harassed her and exposed his erect penis to her and later that year raped her in his downtown Manhattan apartment. She quit Def Jam soon after but was subsequently harassed by another boss, L. A. Reid.
USA TODAY has reached out to Winfrey's representatives for comment.
In his post Friday, Simmons continued, saying he has "refused to get in the mud with any accusers, but let’s acknowledge what I have shared. I have taken and passed nine 3-hour lie detector tests (taken for my daughters), that these stories have been passed on by CNN, NBC, BUZZFEED, NY POST, NY MAG, AND OTHERS. Now that you have reviewed the facts and you SHOULD have learned what I know; that these stories are UNUSABLE and that 'hurt people hurt people'. "
Simmons capped off his post admitting he's "guilty of exploiting, supporting, and making the soundtrack for a grossly unequal society," but that he's "never been violent or forced" himself on anyone.
"Still I am here to help support a necessary shift in power and consciousness," he wrote. "Let us get to work on uplifting humanity and put this moment and old narrative behind. "

On Twitter, Oprah also received criticism from some who questioned why she wasn't focusing on Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein. Rapper 50 Cent took to Instagram to defend Simmons, saying he doesn't "understand why Oprah is going after black men. "
Such documentaries, he added, "are publicly convicting their targets, it makes them guilty till proven innocent. "

Gretchen Carlson: Fox News, I want my voice back

Texto completo: When my retaliation and sexual harassment complaint against Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman and C.E.O., went public in 2016, there were no #MeToo or Times Up movements to help rally support for my cause. In the years that followed, many more women have found the courage to come forward, calling out Bill O’Reilly, Matt Lauer, Charlie Rose, Harvey Weinstein, and other powerful men accused of abusing their power. When I sued, I could have never known that my story and the stories of other women at Fox would turn into both a television mini-series and a film, and, more important, that I would be prohibited from speaking about these projects.
Three years ago, receiving a public apology from 21st Century Fox and retaining the right to speak about harassment generally felt like big wins. And they were. But had I known my complaint would help ignite such a profound cultural shift and that I would be depicted onscreen, I would have also fought against signing the nondisclosure agreement, or NDA, that prevented me from discussing my experiences while working at Fox News. At the time, I just wanted to bring closure to an ugly chapter in my life; I thought it would, at the most, lead to a week of press attention — not spawn a mini-series, a movie and become part of a global rallying cry.
“Winning” my complaint with a settlement and a nondisclosure agreement meant I was, essentially, forced into silence. NDAs were originally designed to safeguard the sharing of proprietary corporate information (think the formula for Coca-Cola), not to protect predatory behavior. Although NDAs usually prohibit employers from disparaging victims, whisper campaigns often follow women for years. As I documented in my book “Be Fierce,” the vast majority of survivors never work in their chosen professions again. American industry has lost many talented women to harassment, while allowing predators to continue climbing the professional ladder (where they have the potential to victimize even more women).
There are those who say to victims, “You took money in exchange for staying quiet, so what’s the problem?” and “If you want to talk, give your settlement money back.” These sentiments miss the point and perpetuate the lie that victims benefit from being sexually harassed. First of all, buying silence instead of stopping harassment is immoral and unjust. Next, the settlements are made not just in exchange for secrecy, but to make up for lost wages, because once you find the courage to come forward, your “reward” is often that you’ve lost your job (and potentially your career). And lastly, NDAs foster a culture that gives predators cover to commit the same crimes again.
Ironically, while most of the real women involved in the Fox News scandals remain muzzled by NDAs, two high profile Hollywood projects (Showtime’s limited series “The Loudest Voice” and Lionsgate’s upcoming feature “Bombshell”) can freely tell stories without our participation. While projects like these will certainly inspire more women to come forward, and while it’s certainly flattering (and surreal) to be depicted by such remarkable, empathetic actors as Naomi Watts and Nicole Kidman, my experience is yet another example of why the laws governing NDAs must change.
In practical terms, my NDA means I am legally prohibited from discussing — in public and in private — what happened to me. It means I cannot consult with filmmakers, writers, journalists or anyone else telling my story — whether it’s about the depiction of me, my family, or the events themselves — nor can I comment on the accuracy of a final product. I don’t know precisely what Fox would do if I violated the agreement, but presumably they’d take legal and financial actions. It’s a strange and frustrating reality.
Prohibited from telling my story, for three years I’ve focused on helping other women tell theirs through “Be Fierce” and my Lifetime documentary “Breaking the Silence.” I’ve worked with members of Congress to introduce the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act, a bill that has achieved bipartisan support from leaders including Senators Lindsey Graham and Kirsten Gillibrand. When two leaders so ideologically different are on the same page about forced arbitration, it really says something. Harassment in the workplace is apolitical.
I want my voice back. I want it back for me, and for all those silenced by forced arbitration and NDAs. There is positive movement in this direction. NBC’s recent announcement that it would release former employees from their NDAs is an important step and one that should be emulated across business, media and politics. New Jersey has already passed a law prohibiting NDAs in harassment cases, and California recently outlawed forced arbitration as a condition of employment. This week, former Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky and I launched a new nonprofit organization called Lift Our Voices to advocate an end to the harmful practice of mandatory NDAs, confidentiality provisions and forced arbitration clauses that have prevented employees from publicly discussing and disclosing toxic workplace conditions, including sexual harassment and assault. This is the next phase in the #MeToo movement, and it is one that needs to gain traction if we truly want to change the culture for better.
Today I call on Fox News to release me, and all employees forced to sign NDAs as a condition of harassment settlements, from these agreements immediately. None of us expected or wanted a workplace dispute — we were simply the ones who had the ability and the courage to speak up, and for that, we lost our jobs. We have a right to say what is factually correct or incorrect about what happened. We have a right to our voices and our truths. I urge executives at Fox to do what’s right and take this step today. For the sake of all women, in every workplace. That would be the biggest bombshell of all.

Previews & Openings
'LONDON ASSURANCE' at the Irish Repertory Theater (in previews; opens on Dec. 15). When the Irish playwright Dion Boucicault was barely out of his teens, he wrote a farce that tickled most of London. The Irish Rep, which has lovingly revived othere Boucicault Irish plays, revisits this 1841 tidbit about money, disguise and romance. Charlotte Moore directs a cast including Rachel Pickup as Lady Gay Spanker.

'SING STREET' at New York Theater Workshop (in previews; opens on Dec. 16). John Carney's 2016 movie, which A. O. Scott described as "an autobiographical tribute to Dublin, hair gel and the power of lip-syncing," arrives Off Broadway. The playwright Enda Walsh, who also adapted Carney's "Once," joins the director Rebecca Taichman and the choreographer Sonya Tayeh for this story of a boy, a girl and a band.

Last Chance
'FIRES IN THE MIRROR' at the Pershing Square Signature Center (closes on Dec. 22). Anna Deavere Smith's 1992 anatomization of the Crown Heights riots ends its run. In Saheem Ali's revival, Deavere has handed the piece over to Michael Benjamin Washington, who performs verbatim monologues, based on interviews with African-Americans and Hasidic Jews as well as others. The piece still, Ben Brantley wrote, "makes you catch your breath and shake your head in sorrow."
212-244-7529, signaturetheatre.org
'FOR COLORED GIRLS WHO HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE/WHEN THE RAINBOW IS ENUF' at the Public Theater (closes on Dec. 15). Leah C. Gardiner's ecstatic, anguished revival of Ntozake Shange's choreopoem reaches its end. Ben Brantley wrote that what is most pervasive in this production, which stars Jayme Lawson, Adrienne C. Moore and Okwui Okpokwasili, among others, is its "sense of women talking to -- and being deeply invested in -- one another, as if in an eternal support group."

Texto completo: A law would mandate that affordable-housing projects built with city assistance must have 15 percent of the apartments reserved for the homeless.
As New York City grapples with record numbers of homeless people, Mayor Bill de Blasio has faced deepening criticism that his plan to create more affordable housing, a signature effort of his administration, has done little to help people move from shelters into stable homes.
In an effort to address the shortfall, city officials have agreed to force developers of designated affordable-housing projects to set aside 15 percent of the units for the homeless.
The requirement will be the centerpiece of a bill that the City Council is expected to pass next week, and represents one of the city's most ambitious efforts in a decade to address the dearth of housing for homeless people.
The legislation, which applies to rental buildings with more than 40 units, could add roughly 1,000 new apartments for the homeless a year, almost doubling the 1,300 apartments that are currently under development.
Many other cities require these so-called set-asides for the lowest-income households. Boston, for instance, requires that city-funded developments with at least 10 rental units reserve 10 percent for homeless families. But there does not appear to be another mandate on the scale proposed under the legislation in New York.
The measure pending before the City Council is the culmination of a long effort to push Mr. de Blasio to redraw his housing plan to address a homeless crisis that has shown no signs of abating. About 79,000 people now live in New York's shelters or streets, up from about 64,000 people the year before Mr. de Blasio took office.
The mayor's plan, which seeks to create or preserve 300,000 apartments, includes a goal of designating at least 15,000 units for homeless people.
Because Mr. de Blasio's plan applies to the overall total, and not specific developments, homeless set-asides have tended to be clustered in poorer neighborhoods, particularly in the Bronx.
The Council's plan would impose a hard mandate on individual developers on a project-by-project basis, potentially spreading such housing into neighborhoods that have had the political muscle to resist it.
The legislation, which has the support of 34 Council members as well as the mayor and the public advocate, Jumaane D. Williams, would take effect in July 2020.
"We have a homelessness crisis in New York City, and we have to start getting aggressive or we are never going to fix it," said Corey Johnson, the Democratic speaker of the City Council and a likely mayoral candidate in 2021, when Mr. de Blasio concludes his final term as mayor.
Nonetheless, New York's effort still falls short of the original bill's language, which sought to apply the 15 percent set aside to a wider range of residential buildings.
The bill's sponsor, Rafael Salamanca Jr., a councilman from the Bronx, said his goal was to increase set-asides for homeless people, yet make sure such reserved housing was integrated into all neighborhoods across the city.
"This is hope. We are giving homeless families hope," Mr. Salamanca said. "This is about fair share. Some districts are looking down on families who have had bad luck."
Mr. de Blasio's administration argues that it has recently begun requiring more set-asides. About 9 percent of the units the city has financed so far are reserved for homeless people, higher than the original 5 percent goal.
"This agreement will ensure it's written into law that future administrations continue the progress we've made," said Jane Meyer, a spokeswoman for Mr. de Blasio. "Homeless New Yorkers can rest assured we're doing all we can to put a safe and stable roof over their heads."
Still more than half of the projects included in the mayor's plan for low-income people have no homeless set-asides, according to an analysis by the Coalition for the Homeless.
The largest share of newly opened units where homeless people have been placed has been in the Bronx, about 37 percent, according to city data requested by The New York Times. About 55 percent of the new construction projects financed for extremely low-income people are in the Bronx.
Mr. Salamanca's involvement in the bill can be traced to a confrontation last year between a homeless woman, Nathylin Flowers Adesegun, and Mr. de Blasio. Ms. Adesegun, who lives in a shelter in Queens and was active in homeless issues, asked the mayor at the Brooklyn gym that he attends why his housing plan did not include more units for homeless people. In a moment caught on video, the mayor smirked, declined to talk and walked away.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Ms. Adesegun and advocates for the homeless continued to protest Mr. de Blasio and urged Council members to take legislative action, eventually working with Mr. Salamanca.
In interviews, developers of affordable housing in New York City acknowledged that they held a crucial role in helping reduce the city's homeless population.
But the developers, who agreed to discuss the legislation only on the condition of anonymity, suggested that it made more sense to place housing for the homeless close to other city social services. They favored a framework that gave the city the right to tweak the percentages in each residential project.
"The flexibility is very important," one developer said. "There is no question that the city should be doing as much as possible for the formerly homeless, but it is difficult to legislate that every single building have a 15 percent set-aside when there are not services to go along with that 15 percent."
The Real Estate Board of New York, the industry's main lobbying arm, echoed the developers' concerns about social services.
"A robust set of services is essential once housing is provided," said Basha Gerhards, the group's vice president of policy and planning. "We join with advocates across the city to ask that the mayor and the Council put forward a plan that truly provides for this."
Mr. de Blasio has repeatedly said that he favored a measure of flexibility in his housing plan, consistently urging that it should help those with a range of incomes.
"Affordable housing initiatives cannot just be for the lowest income folks," the mayor said in a radio interview in September. "There has to be a place for work force housing and middle-class housing as well."
In 2017, Mr. de Blasio announced a homeless strategy that called for the opening of 90 shelters and improved social services. But the administration has opened only 30 new shelters, and the efforts have not driven down the number of people who seek refuge in them.
Other strategies have been more successful.
The city has provided free legal assistance to tenants facing eviction, resulting in evictions dropping by a third between 2013 and 2018. With new rental assistance voucher programs, the city has moved about 111,000 people out of shelters and has prevented about 22,000 people from entering them in the first place.
But the rental assistance vouchers are not a panacea; recipients have complained about poor housing stock and the length of time it takes to find landlords that accept the vouchers.
The new apartments at Villa Gardens in the Bronx are a vivid example of the mayor's vision. Tenants who move in next year will have plenty of light from their floor-to-ceiling windows, a rooftop recreation area and easy access to the elevated train that rumbles past the building.
All 52 apartments will go to low- and middle-income renters; none are set aside for the homeless.
Javon Ford, a 28-year-old restaurant porter who lives in a shelter nearby, said he has a housing voucher worth $ 1,303 a month, and has been looking for an apartment. He said he had entered lotteries for city-financed units like the ones in Villa Gardens, but was turned down twice.
"The system, it's just made for you to fail," he said.
Ivy Faison and her husband, Kevin, had been living in a shelter for about four years when they won a lottery last year for a unit in a building that had been set aside for the homeless in East New York, Brooklyn.
Ms. Faison, 60, cried as she remembered that her husband, who had trouble walking and illnesses that caused seizures, finally had comfortable surroundings. Mr. Faison died of heart disease in August.
She remembered the day they first saw the apartment in the building, which received $ 6.5 million in city financing. "I just kissed my floors, and I said, 'Thank you, heavenly Father, so much,"' she said.
Susan Beachy contributed research.

Texto completo: On a day in which North Korea issued a fresh threat and a House committee set the stage for his impeachment, President Trump on Thursday found time to insult 16-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg after she was named Time's Person of the Year, an honor he has coveted for years.
Trump's mocking of Thunberg, who has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, as having an 'Anger Management problem' drew widespread umbrage from Democrats who accused the president of bullying a teenager. His tweet came just a week after Republicans cried foul when a university professor made a joke referencing Barron Trump, the president's 13-year-old son, during impeachment testimony.
'So ridiculous,' Trump wrote in a tweet about Thunberg's Time honor, suggesting that one of the world's most powerful voices for the environmental movement 'go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend. Chill Greta, Chill!'
The message was one of more than 100 tweets or retweets the president sent Thursday to more than 67 million followers, the second time he has surpassed that number of posts this week. Trump's increasing use of social messaging " mostly focusing on defending himself in the House Democrats' impeachment probe " suggests the president is eager to rally his conservative base at a politically perilous moment.
But his targeting of a teenager went beyond his usual broadsides directed at his political adversaries in Washington.
'He can't bully @SpeakerPelosi, so he's trying to bully a teenager,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) wrote on Twitter. He added the hashtag #BeBest, the name of first lady Melania Trump's online anti-bullying campaign aimed at young people.
Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, reacted to Trump's insults by imploring him to 'stop slinging insults at a teenager - start acting like an adult.'
As other political leaders, including Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, rushed to her defense, Thunberg offered a sly rejoinder to Trump, 73, by updating her Twitter profile to describe herself as: 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.'
Trump's attack on Thunberg, which came in response to a tweet congratulating her by Roma Downey " an actress who is married to Mark Burnett, a producer on Trump's previous reality television series 'The Apprentice' " marked the second time he has publicly belittled her.
During the U.N. General Assembly in September, Trump tweeted sarcastically that Thunberg seemed like 'a very happy young girl. . . . So nice to see!' after a video of her impassioned " and somewhat fatalistic " plea to global leaders about the dangers of climate change went viral.
The president has called climate change a 'hoax,' and his administration has relaxed carbon emissions regulations on power plants and the auto industry and begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, signed by every other nation.
Time's selection of Thunberg as its 2019 honoree has prompted praise among many liberals, but the president's conservative allies have joined him in denouncing the decision.
Donald Trump Jr. invoked a line from Thunberg's U.N. speech in asking Time, 'How dare you?' " and he suggested the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong would have been the better choice. Charlie Kirk, president of Turning Point USA, a conservative student group, called Thunberg, who began skipping a day of school to draw attention to the climate issue, a 'perpetual truant' and declared Trump should have taken the honor.
The rush among Trump allies to bash Thunberg marked a striking contrast to their professed outrage last week when Pamela Karlan, a Stanford University law professor, had invoked Barron Trump's name during her testimony before the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment hearing. In making a point that Trump is not a dictator, Karlan quipped that 'while the president can name his son Barron, he can't make him a baron.'
'Pamela Karlan, you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering, and using a child to do it,' the first lady wrote in a tweet.
Yet on Thursday, Melania Trump and others who had scolded Karlan, including White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham and several GOP lawmakers, were silent about the president's attack on Thunberg. White House officials, including Grisham, did not respond to a request for comment, and messages to the offices of Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Mike Johnson (R-La.), who denounced Karlan's remarks, went unanswered. A Trump campaign spokeswoman also did not respond to an email.
Some conservatives have argued that because Thunberg, unlike Barron Trump, is a political activist, she is fair game for criticism from those whose policies she has campaigned against and whose moral values she has questioned.
'The difference between the two cases should be plain: Greta, or her handlers, have placed her directly in the public spotlight for explicitly political reasons,' said Daniel Lee, a National Review contributor who has compared Thunberg to Samantha Smith, an American girl who campaigned against nuclear weapons in the 1980s. 'Barron is a noncombatant, having no intentional public footprint at all.'
Lee added of the president: 'Personally, I'd rather see him include in his criticism the people who are putting her in this very public position, but not criticizing her at all just plays into the hands of the activists using her youth and innocence to ward off criticism of their goals.'
Trump has not engaged Thunberg on specific policy points, but rather made personal attacks. During his presidency, Trump has shown little restraint mocking those with disabilities " or suggesting, without evidence, that his targets are mentally ill.
During his presidential campaign, he appeared to mock a disabled reporter from the New York Times during a rally, although he denied having done so. He has called actress Rosie O'Donnell a 'mentally sick woman,' and questioned the mental capacity of two fellow New Yorkers " former state attorney general Eliot Spitzer and former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner.
Trump referred to his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as a 'mentally retarded southerner,' according to a book by the journalist Bob Woodward.
'What kind of president bullies a teenager? @realDonaldTrump, you could learn a few things from Greta on what it means to be a leader,' Biden wrote in a tweet. The former vice president has been angered over Trump's criticism of his son Hunter's role on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, which had prompted the president to privately press that country's president over the summer to launch an investigation into the Bidens " a move that led to the House impeachment probe.
In explaining Time's choice of Thunberg as Person of the Year, the magazine's editor in chief, Edward Felsenthal, said Wednesday that 'she became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.'
Trump, who was among the five finalists for the distinction this year, has had a long obsession with the magazine's selections, dating back before he became president. Fake 2009 Time covers showing Trump as person of the year and touting his days as host of 'The Apprentice' have been found hanging in several of his golf clubs.
In 2015, as a candidate for president, Trump took to Twitter to complain after Time chose German Chancellor Angela Merkel for her leadership in the Greek debt crisis and European migrant crisis. Time did honor Trump in 2016 after he won the White House by defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton, prompting a tweet that called the selection 'a great honor.'
A few hours after Trump's tweet Thursday, his campaign sent out an altered image of Time's cover with Trump's head superimposed in place of Thunberg's and a tag line promoting the 'power of promises kept.'

Wyoming Republican John Barrasso is 'closing the distance' on climate change

Texto completo: Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a state run on fossil fuels, is "closing the distance" between himself and Democrats on policy proposals to combat climate change.
Barrasso is reluctant to eliminate the gap, viewing Democratic solutions as overly prescriptive, dramatic, and harmful to fossil fuels.
"I agree with the science," said Barrasso, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, in a rare sit-down interview in his office. "I disagree with the solutions Democrats are proposing in terms of this alarmist view. Is it a concern? Yes. But it's not a crisis."
Asked to describe his position further, Barrasso would not concede human use of fossil fuels is the leading cause of climate change, as the majority of scientists say.
"I am not willing to say that. I am willing to say humans are contributing to the problem, and we have a responsibility to work toward a solution that's global," said Barrasso, who cited his background as an orthopedic surgeon who studied biology at Georgetown University in saying that he respects science.
Barrasso used to describe climate change slightly differently, saying that humanity's role in it is "not known," before identifying himself in a 2018 op-ed in the New York Times as someone who believes "we have a responsibility to do something" about it.
Barrasso has never been an outright skeptic of climate change, as was his predecessor as chairman of the environment committee, Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Republican known for brandishing a snowball on the Senate floor as evidence that the world is not warming.
But Democrats and environmental groups long considered him to be one of the leading barriers to advancing legislation to curb carbon emissions, such as a failed bid to pass cap and trade in 2009.
Barrasso pushes back on the idea that he's changed his position at all.
He referenced a bill he introduced in 2009 with then-Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, the former chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, to award prizes to scientists and researchers who develop technologies to remove and store carbon from the atmosphere.
A press release issued by Barrasso's office from that time noted the bill was meant to "address global warming."
"I have a consistent history of introducing legislation along these lines," Barrasso said in the interview.
However, Barrasso has long highlighted the economic costs of responding to climate change through regulation or by taxing carbon emissions, and he's questioned the authority that federal agencies have to address it without Congress.
Barrasso, as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, is also a friend and ally to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a coal industry supporter who is the central boogeyman Democrats blame for the lack of sweeping climate legislation.
"I am against taxes on all this sort of stuff," Barrasso said. "Look at what the dangerous Democrat socialist policies are. It's the Green New Deal."
Barrasso's colleagues insist that his public posture and urgency to address climate change have changed, similar to the shift occurring among many Republicans in Congress, including leaders such as top House Republican Kevin McCarthy.
Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a frequent collaborator, described Barrasso as an "intensely decent and honorable" person who "wants to do the right thing" but is limited to what he can do because of the state he represents.
"He is way too smart not to be able to see through the climate denial nonsense," Whitehouse told the Washington Examiner. "His seat puts him in a position where there is some distance between me and him. He is trying as hard as he can to close the distance. I am trying to help."
Barrasso is promoting private sector innovation as the solution to climate change.
He teamed up with Whitehouse last year on legislation signed into law by President Trump extending and expanding an essential tax credit to help build carbon capture projects. The duo co-wrote another bill signed by Trump in January to streamline the federal government's approval process for advanced nuclear reactors.
Barrasso is also grappling with the decline of coal in Wyoming, which remains the leading coal-producing state, thanks to its Powder River Basin. It is also diversifying to produce more natural gas, a less carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and wind, taking advantage of mountainous, rural terrain.
Wyoming also has the largest uranium mining operations in the United States, which explains Barrasso's strong support for nuclear power, which emits no carbon, despite the state not having any nuclear plants.
"Wyoming is the Saudi Arabia of wind," Barrasso said before trailing off. "And oil and gas and uranium. We have it all."
While Wyoming is struggling with lower revenue from fossil fuels, the production of coal, oil, and gas continues to fund a majority of the state's budget.
That reality influences Barrasso's stance on carbon regulations or taxes that would eliminate coal and eventually limit oil and gas. He won't say if the U.S. needs to reduce its use of fossil fuels.
"You want to deal with the carbon component of that," Barrasso said, alluding to his support for carbon capture, which would limit the emissions of coal or gas plants.
Whitehouse has called the Republican embrace of innovation "bullshit" because the party won't pair the strategy with a carbon tax, which he says would spur quicker adoption of cleaner technologies to replace fossil fuels.
"Planting seeds here and there is one thing," Whitehouse said. "But if you really want innovation to be the solution, you need to create the demand. To do that, you need to put a price on carbon."
Barrasso said that and he Whitehouse frequently exchange emails on the pros and cons of a carbon tax. Big oil and gas companies have endorsed a carbon tax that returns the revenue to taxpayers, but congressional Republicans remain skeptical.
"Sheldon, I wish he were here because what I would tell him is these are real things and solutions," Barrasso said of his innovation agenda. "I disagree with a carbon tax, but we are both headed toward innovation."
Barrasso argued that a carbon tax would disadvantage the U.S. economy relative to China and India, the trio of countries that emit the most greenhouse gases.
"If you want to actually deal long term with the climate challenge, it's not punishing the United States," Barrasso said. "You have to come up with a global technology that China and India will use."
But Whitehouse is trying to convince Barrasso otherwise, warning him that Wyoming's dependence on fossil fuels risks stranding oil and gas reserves and production facilities once the country moves to a lower-carbon economy.
"I would be surprised if he were the first Republican to announce support for a big carbon price," Whitehouse said. "But if I try to put myself in his shoes, there are also values and natural assets that Wyoming has that are put at risk by not addressing climate change in a serious way."

Texto completo: NUEVA YORK – Harvey Weinstein llegó a un acuerdo de principio para indemnizar a presuntas víctimas, indicó el miércoles a la AFP el abogado de una de ellas, un arreglo que no concierne las demandas penales contra el exproductor de cine inculpado por agresión sexual.
El acuerdo, revelado inicialmente por el diario The New York Times, prevé el desembolso de $25 millones de dólares a estas víctimas y aún debe ser validado por un juez para tornarse oficial.
El acuerdo de principio fue confirmado a la AFP por el abogado Aaron Filler, que representa a la actriz estadounidense Paz De La Huerta , quien afirma haber sido violada por Harvey Weinstein en 2010.
Un inminente acuerdo con las víctimas estaba sobre el tapete desde mayo, pero varias mujeres dijeron en público que no lo aceptarían.
La indemnización de decenas de presuntas víctimas del magnate de Hollywood se inscribe en un documento que saldaría el conjunto de deudas, contenciosos y obligaciones de The Weinstein Company, la productora creada por Harvey Weinstein y su hermano Bob.
Las aseguradoras del grupo, que ha declarado la quiebra, aceptaron pagar en total $47 millones de dólares a las presuntas víctimas de acoso y agresiones sexuales, y también a los acreedores del grupo, según The New York Times.
El acuerdo pondría fin a las demandas iniciadas por todas las mujeres que acepten sus términos, mientras quienes no acepten conservan el derecho a buscar una indemnización en la justicia.
Según el diario The Wall Street Journal, saldaría también la acción civil que inició el fiscal del estado de Nueva York contra los dirigentes de la Weinstein Company por negligencia.
Harvey Weinstein no tendría que pagar ni un dólar de la suma, ya que el total sería solventado por las compañías de seguros, incluido sus gastos judiciales en el ámbito civil.
Pero el acuerdo no concierne las demandas penales iniciadas por el fiscal de Manhattan, Cyrus Vance, que desembocarán en un juicio cuyo inicio está previsto para el 6 de enero.
En lo penal, Weinstein fue inculpado de cinco cargos por la presunta violación de una mujer en 2013 y la agresión sexual de otra en 2006. Se ha declarado no culpable.
Un total de 87 mujeres acusan al exproductor de cine de agresión o acoso sexual, incluidas varias actrices famosas como Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie y Salma Hayek. Pero ninguna de estas participó en las negociaciones del acuerdo ni ha demandado a Weinstein ante la justicia.

The Associated Press
NEW YORK - A tentative $25 million settlement revealed Wednesday to end nearly every sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against Harvey Weinstein and his former film studio's board was praised by a plaintiff and some lawyers but criticized by others who say those who opt out are punished.
Louisette Geiss, a plaintiff in a Manhattan federal court class-action lawsuit, said the settlement was "our way to hold all women up. We are trying to create a new reality where this type of behavior is not accepted."
In a statement, she said the lawsuit was intended as "a wake-up call for all companies that they will be held accountable if they protect predators in their midst."
"Now that The Weinstein Company is in bankruptcy and Harvey is about to stand trial, this settlement will ensure that all survivors have the chance for recovery and can move forward without Harvey's damaging lock on their careers," Geiss said.
The New York Times first reported the deal, which was confirmed to The Associated Press by several lawyers for plaintiffs.
Attorney Thomas Giuffra said the agreement was the same deal announced several months ago but with more punitive provisions aimed at forcing holdouts to accept it.
"The most troubling aspect of this settlement is a punitive provision designed to force victims to settle," Giuffra said in a statement.
Attorney Elizabeth Fegan said at least 29 actresses and former Weinstein employees who had sued the movie mogul for accusations ranging from sexual misconduct to rape had agreed to the deal. She said that number included the New York attorney general's office, which also had sued.
Weinstein would avoid paying any of his own money and he would not be required to admit wrongdoing as part of the deal. Insurance companies would cover the settlement's cost, the Times reported.
Weinstein faces a Jan. 6 trial on rape and sexual assault charges. His bail was increased from $1 million to $5 million on Wednesday for allegedly mishandling his electronic ankle monitor.
He has pleaded not guilty to charges he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and performed a forcible sex act on a different woman in 2006.

Texto completo: PARIS - France's prime minister said Wednesday that the full retirement age will be increased for the country's youngest, but offered concessions in an ill-fated effort to calm a nationwide protest against pension reforms that critics say will erode the nation's way of life.
The government says it wants to make the pensions system sustainable and simpler but is facing public pressure, including a week of the most debilitating transport strikes in decades.
Major unions were quick to reject the proposals and vowed to strike on.
The day after more than 300,000 people protested across France, metro lines in Paris but two were closed and many train routes remained canceled as unions dig in their heels against President Emmanuel Macron, whom they accuse of shaping policies in favor of the rich.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe detailed the pension changes in a speech Wednesday, saying bluntly that the French "will need to work longer."
People born after 1974 will have to work until age 64 to get a full pension, instead of 62 previously. Those born before that date will not be affected, he said.
The new scheme is aimed at replacing a complicated pension system that included dozens of special privileges for some sectors, like public transport, with one set of rules.
Philippe said the changes ensure the pension system is "fair and sustainable" for a growing population with a record number of people over 90.
For people entering the workforce, the reforms will only start to apply in 2022, which happens to be the last year of Macron's term.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi defends Myanmar army in UN court
THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi denied Wednesday that Myanmar's armed forces committed genocide, telling the United Nation's top court that the mass exodus of Rohingya people from the country she leads was the unfortunate result of a battle with insurgents.
The image of the former pro-democracy icon appearing before the International Court of Justice to defend the army that kept her under house arrest for 15 years was striking.
Myanmar's accusers have described a deliberate campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide that drove more than 700,000 Rohingya to neighboring Bangladesh.
Suu Kyi calmly rebuffed allegations that army personnel killed civilians, raped women and torched houses in 2017.
Leaders scramble for votes as UK's ugly campaigning ends
LONDON - Britain's election has been like the country's late-autumn weather: chilly and dull, with blustery outbursts.
On the last day of the campaign, political leaders dashed around the U.K. on Wednesday trying to win over millions of undecided voters who will likely determine the outcome.
Opinion polls suggest Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have a lead over the main opposition Labour Party led by Jeremy Corbyn ahead of Thursday's election.
Britain's first December vote since 1923 for all 650 seats in the House of Commons has been dubbed the Brexit Election. It comes more than two years early in hopes of breaking the political deadlock over the country's stalled departure from the European Union.
Report: Giuliani settles long divorce from his third wife
NEW YORK - Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his third wife have reached a settlement in a yearslong court battle that exposed details about their luxurious lifestyle, The New York Times reported.
Giuliani, 75, and his wife, Judith, put an end to their differences and "intend to remain friends in the years to come," Judith Giuliani's divorce attorney, Bernard Clair, told the newspaper.
The couple was married for 15 years.
Throughout the divorce, details about the couple's $230,000 monthly budget became public, including six houses, 11 country club memberships and $12,000 on Rudy Giuliani's cigars.
Giuliani previously was married for 20 years to Donna Hanover. Before that, he was married for 14 years to Regina Peruggi.
YouTube cracks down on racist, sexist insults
SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube is taking another step to curb hateful and violent speech on its site.
The video streaming company said it will now take down videos that lob insults at people based on race, gender expression, sexual orientation or other "protected attributes." The Google-owned company will also prohibit veiled threats of violence, taking a step further into moderating what people can say on the videos they create and upload.
YouTube has been slapped with criticism from politicians, viewers and video creators for the material it allows on - and bans from - the site. The site has been accused of allowing and fostering hate speech and extremism and creating spaces for harassment to linger online, along with other digital sites that allow people to upload their own material, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Chile: Debris found believed to be from missing plane
PUNTA ARENAS, Chile - The Chilean Air Force says it has recovered debris believed to be from a military transport plan carrying 38 people that vanished days earlier en route to Antarctica.
Air Force Gen. Eduardo Mosqueira says "sponge" material was found floating roughly 18 miles from the place the C-130 Hercules last had radio contact.
It had left southern Chile and was flying over Drake Pass, a notoriously turbulent area.
Mosqueira said Wednesday the debris will be analyzed to see if it corresponds to the missing plane. He says the process could take up to two days to confirm.
The C-130 Hercules took off Monday afternoon from a base in far-southern Chile on a regular maintenance flight for an Antarctic base. Radio contact was lost 70 minutes later.
In Niger: About 100 Islamic militants ambushed an army camp in western Niger, a military spokesman said late Wednesday, killing at least 71 soldiers in the deadliest attack on the West African country's forces in years.
The large-scale attack comes amid a surge of assaults on army camps in the Sahel region, which have allowed jihadists to amass weapons and vehicles for their arsenal. Neighboring Mali has seen such an increase in ambushes on its army that it has even closed some of its most remote and vulnerable army outposts.
A Niger army spokesman read the death toll announcement on state TV Wednesday night and said a dozen others had been wounded after the ambush overnight.

Texto completo: A meeting with Nicolas Sarkozy, Michel Platini and Qatar's prime minister draws scrutiny.
The French authorities have opened a corruption investigation into the circumstances that led to Qatar being awarded the 2022 World Cup.
The investigation, which will be led by a judge, follows a three year operation by prosecutors specializing in financial crimes into the decision in December 2010. More than half of the 22 members of FIFA's executive committee who voted have since been either accused of corruption or prosecuted for it.
French investigators have particularly focused on the case because of a meeting that took place at the Élysée Palace, the official residence of France's president, a month before the vote. It was there that Nicolas Sarkozy, France's president at the time, and two close aides, held a lunch with Michel Platini, a former head of European soccer and an influential voter in the choice of World Cup venues, and Qatar's then prime minister.
Platini claims he was shocked to see Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who is now Qatar's emir, in the room, and had attended only to inform Sarkozy that he had decided to pick Qatar to host the soccer tournament.
A spokeswoman for France's financial crimes prosecutor confirmed the investigation, first reported by the French investigative news website Mediapart, but declined to comment further, citing secrecy rules.
Platini has been questioned twice by authorities. Most recently he was detained in June, along with the two aides to Sarkozy present at the lunch. Days earlier, in an interview with The New York Times, he said he had done nothing wrong.
Qatar has issued strong denials of corruption since the day it was picked to host the World Cup. That has not stopped a string of lurid allegations and claims over how the wealthy country managed to convince FIFA's board members that it was more suitable than rivals including Japan, South Korea, Australia and the United States, which it defeated in a final runoff vote.
The latest reminder came earlier this month. A FIFA document, outlining a life ban to the former head of Brazilian soccer, included witness testimony from 2018 that alleged three South Americans were paid vast sums for their votes.
"We maintain that we conducted our bid ethically and with integrity, strictly adhering to all rules and regulations," Qatar's World Cup organizers said in a statement.
While Platini has insisted that he had always intended to vote for Qatar, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter has claimed that was not the case. He has often repeated details of an agreement the two men had to choose Russia for the 2018 event and the United States for the tournament four years later.
Platini said of the lunch in Paris that he was expecting to have a private meeting with Sarkozy and that he was surprised when he found the Qataris had also been invited. "I came to tell him face to face that I will choose Qatar and Russia," Platini told The Times in June, adding that he immediately contacted Blatter to tell him what had happened. FIFA's rules, Platini said, meant meetings with bidding nations had to be cleared beforehand.
"After, I called Blatter to tell him I am in big trouble because I have lunch, I didn't know there were the Qataris at the lunch with Sarkozy," he added. The French authorities previously questioned Platini in December 2017.
Platini, a French former midfield great who won the Ballon d'Or three times during his playing career, was barred from soccer for four years in 2015 after an investigation into a payment of 2 million Swiss francs, or about $ 2 million, authorized by Blatter, who was also barred. Platini's soccer ban ended in October, and he has vowed to clear his name. FIFA has started legal proceedings to reclaim the money received by Platini.
France's financial crimes prosecutors have been among the most active in pursuing allegations against Qatar. In a separate case, they filed preliminary charges against Nasser el Khelaifi and Yousef al-Obaidly, the most-senior figures at Qatar-based beIN Media Group, on suspicion of bribing officials during the bidding process for track and field's world championships. Both men deny the allegations.

Experts Quit an Inquiry Of the Hong Kong Police

Texto completo: The panel's withdrawal is a blow to the government's effort to meet public demands for an independent investigation into allegations of police brutality.
HONG KONG -- A group of foreign experts hired to give more credibility to Hong Kong's police watchdog while it investigated accusations of brutality has quit over the agency's lack of powers, dealing a blow to the government.
The experts said in a statement they would "formally stand aside" after concluding that the city's police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Council, had limited authority to conduct independent investigations.
The protest movement has called for a judge-led independent commission to review the police's conduct, a demand that draws broad public support. Critics say the council, which is stacked with conservative figures and unable to summon witnesses, is toothless.
The government and the police force have rejected the protesters' demand, saying the watchdog would suffice. The watchdog hired the international panel, which included policing experts from Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, in early September to try to give the probe more credibility.
The foreign experts said last month that the council needed the power to subpoena witnesses and verify the police's version of events. The experts said on Wednesday that without such authority, the inquiry would not meet the public's expectations "of a police watchdog operating in a society that values freedoms and rights."
The watchdog had earlier rejected the foreign experts' recommendations, with the council's chairman, Anthony Neoh, saying in an interview with the Chinese news media that the experts did not understand Hong Kong's laws.
Pro-democracy lawmakers said the panel's decision to pull out of the investigation only served to support the public's demands.
"The whole incident has become an international laughingstock," Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, told reporters on Wednesday. She said the government thought seeking foreign expertise "could rationalize their irrational state of affairs, but now the opposite has happened."
The council is expected to deliver a preliminary report on its findings in January. Tanya Chan, an opposition lawmaker, said the experts' resignations amounted to a "vote of no confidence" on the investigation. She urged Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's beleaguered leader, to persuade Beijing to support an independent investigation when she meets with Chinese leaders this weekend.
The police have fired nearly 16,000 rounds of tear gas and 10,000 rubber bullets since the protests began in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to China. The heavy use of tear gas, including in densely populated residential neighborhoods, has prompted public health and environmental concerns. More than 6,000 people between the ages of 11 and 84 have been arrested in the continuing unrest.
The police have faced increasing condemnation after being accused of failing to quickly respond to a mob attack on antigovernment protesters in late July in the northern district of Yuen Long. In late August, riot police officers charged onto a subway train, fired pepper spray and beat people in the carriage, further tarnishing the force's image.
Hundreds of thousands of people poured onto the streets on Sunday, six months into the movement, in one of the largest marches in weeks to pressure the government to meet demands for greater civil liberties and police accountability.
But Mrs. Lam has refused to make any further concessions, raising the prospect that the demonstrations could continue for the foreseeable future.
Tensions in Hong Kong eased somewhat after the pro-democracy camp scored a stunning victory in local elections last month, but the police say they are increasingly concerned about the threat of violence. The force said officers had found two homemade bombs containing about 22 pounds of explosives near a high school a day after Sunday's protest.

Compromise on Defense Bill Passes the House With Ease

Texto completo: A bipartisan group of lawmakers agreed to give troops a pay raise and the president his Space Force, while jettisoning a slew of measures that would have reined in the president's war powers.
WASHINGTON -- The House on Wednesday passed a $ 738 billion military policy bill that would authorize the creation of the Space Force championed by President Trump as the sixth branch of the military and secure paid parental leave for more than two million federal workers.
The 377-to-48 vote reflected broad bipartisan support for the compromise package, one of the nation's most expensive military policy bills to date. It passed over the opposition of a bloc of progressive Democrats and libertarian-minded Republicans who objected to its steep price tag and its omission of provisions they had proposed to limit the president's power on an array of military matters.
Most House Republicans threw their support behind the measure, joining with Democrats to ensure its passage. It was part of a year-end burst of bipartisan legislating that has broken out this week, even as the Democratic-led House moves toward impeaching Mr. Trump.
The approval of the package marked a resolution to months of partisan fighting over exactly what would be contained in the must-pass legislation. In July, the House passed its version of the bill, which sought to rein in Mr. Trump's authority on policy after policy, over Republican opposition.
That touched off a behind-the-scenes round of haggling in which lawmakers had to reconcile the House bill with a far less confrontational version passed in the Republican-controlled Senate. Determined to meet the year-end deadline for renewing the legislation and demonstrate their party could legislate on issues of national security even as they pursue the president's removal, Democratic negotiators conceded on a series of hot-button issues.
"This is exactly what the American people have been demanding of government, that we can actually move forward on legislating, on governing, to show that we are adults that are able to get things done on issues of national security," said Representative Andy Kim, a freshman Democrat who represents a New Jersey district that voted for Mr. Trump in 2016. "Even in a time of divided government."
The Senate is expected to take up the compromise bill and send it to the president's desk as early as next week.
But the compromise left some liberal Democrats seething.
While it does not authorize any money to replenish military construction funds Mr. Trump diverted to pay for his wall on the southern border, it also does not contain a measure backed by Democrats to prevent him from raiding the fund in the future. Stronger language that would have forced the cleanup of a dangerous class of chemicals, known as PFAS, was dropped. And the final version jettisoned several other provisions passed by House Democrats: to ban new detainees from being placed at the military detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; to prohibit the sale of certain types of munitions to Saudi Arabia; and to require Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval before taking any military action against Iran.
Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, said in a statement that she would not support the bill even though it contained some amendments she sponsored. "This bill commits the U.S. to endless involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen, continues funding for endless war" under a 2001 military authorization and "does nothing to prevent the administration from launching a disastrous war with Iran," she said.
But Democratic leaders trumpeted the bill for what it did contain: a White House-approved measure that would extend 12 weeks of paid parental leave to civilian federal employees, a 3 percent pay raise for troops and the end to a Defense Department policy known as the widow's tax, which prevents the surviving family members of military personnel from receiving their full benefits.
Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, issued a scathing defense of the bill on Wednesday, calling it "the most progressive defense bill we have passed in decades."
"Throughout the negotiations I failed in one way: I was unable to turn President Trump, Leader McConnell and Chairman Inhofe into Democrats and convince them to suddenly accept all of the provisions they despise," he said in the statement, referring to Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Mr. Smith led the final stages of the negotiations off Capitol Hill and bargained directly with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, according to three officials familiar with the private talks who insisted on anonymity to describe them. Mr. Smith declined on Wednesday to comment on Mr. Kushner's role or the broader negotiations.
Most of the provisions in the compromise bill had already been finalized by the time discussions reached him. But it was Mr. Kushner who helped broker a deal to create the Space Force, a chief priority of the president's, in exchange for the paid parental leave, a measure championed by his wife, Ivanka Trump, also a senior adviser to the president.
"In the case of the White House, they wanted both," said Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican and key ally of Mr. Trump's who sits on the Armed Services Committee and has been a vocal backer of Space Force. "At the end of the day, the president gets two victories."
Mr. Trump appeared to regard the deal with a measure of amazement on Wednesday before the vote. "Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA," he wrote on Twitter, using an acronym for the National Defense Authorization Act.
It was also Mr. Kushner who intervened on measures targeting Saudi Arabia that would have prohibited arms sales or military assistance to the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. He said they were nonstarters for the White House, according to the officials.
Representative Ro Khanna of California, who led a series of amendments seeking to curtail the president's war powers on Iran and Saudi Arabia, called the omission of those measures from the final version "astonishing moral cowardice" in a joint statement with Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont.
"We can't allow the Republicans to continue a policy of expanding military budgets and foreign intervention with a tactic of throwing us a bone every year on a progressive policy," Mr. Khanna said in an interview.

Texto completo: RENSSELAER, N.Y. " At the Friar Tuck newsstand, print " somewhat weirdly " is still alive and well.
You'd think it were 1995 based on the startling variety of newspapers filling the racks at this Albany-area Amtrak station, where I found myself this week.
In this historic moment in American history, the array " the Berkshire Eagle, the Wall Street Journal, the Boston Globe, the Albany Times Union and much more " provided a window into the world of how editors are presenting big news to a divided nation.
And in a culture where many citizens absorb their news on the run, headlines matter, whether seen on a depot newsstand, a TV screen or an iPhone news alert.
On Wednesday, the New York Times and The Washington Post presented the House's articles of impeachment against President Trump as history for the ages, trumpeting the news in big type at the tops of their front pages.
The Wall Street Journal had a different top priority. The impeachment articles were merely a one-column story (next to the dominant treatment of the North American trade deal important to their business readers).
The New York City tabloids were not focused on Washington at all: Their front pages were entirely taken up with sensational coverage of a deadly shooting rampage in a residential neighborhood in Jersey City.
The Post-Star in Glens Falls, N.Y. " one of my favorite small newspapers in the United States (and a 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner for editorial writing) " took a bold approach to the impeachment news.
'Trump left no choice,' blared its banner headline, quoting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Despite the differences in emphasis, there seemed to be general agreement in newspaper world that the presentation of articles of impeachment was a big deal.
But no such agreement could be found as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz released his report on the FBI's investigation of Trump's 2016 campaign.
In this case, we were seriously into the familiar world of 'no-agreed-upon truth.'
Early in the Tuesday news cycle, Fox News offered up its designated contrarian and straight-shooter, Chris Wallace, who pulled no punches as the news broke.
'The headline is that they didn't find the things that Bill Barr and Donald Trump alleged,' Wallace told the Fox News morning viewers. 'There was not political bias by James Comey or by his deputy Andrew McCabe. They found that it was proper to launch the investigation.' (The chyron below Wallace described the report's faulting the FBI's errors in how it obtained court warrants during the investigation.)
But by prime time, of course, the story on Fox News had morphed into something quite unrecognizable from Wallace's description, echoing and building on Attorney General William P. Barr's stunning mischaracterization: 'The Inspector General's report now makes clear that the FBI launched an intrusive investigation on the thinnest of suspicions that, in my view, were insufficient to justify the steps taken.'
Barr's statement prompted USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers to observe, aptly, on Twitter that 'this is the opposite of what the report says.'
Many news organizations were presenting the two somewhat conflicting findings of the IG's report: That the investigation was well-founded and that the FBI had made serious mistakes along the way.
The Post's online headline was one of these: 'FBI was justified in opening Trump campaign probe, but case plagued by 'serious failures,' inspector general finds.'
This double-barreled approach was the most accurate " but nuance isn't really the news media's thing these days. And many print headlines, because of inherent space restrictions, had to make a choice about what to emphasize.
On the Amtrak newsstand on Tuesday, USA Today's decision sent a strong message to those who might have just caught a few words as they rushed to catch the Empire Service to New York City.
Stretching across the top of the front page, the headline delivered its main takeaway: 'Faults found in FBI's surveillance.'
For those who stopped to read the sub-headline, there was this, in much lighter, smaller type: 'But Russia probe was legally justified, inspector general says.'
Some travelers may have actually bought the paper, and could have read a thorough, balanced story underneath the headlines.
But I have my doubts.
As my train chugged away from the throwback print haven at Friar Tuck's newsstand, most people were glued to their phones anyway.

Texto completo: Here's an idea for making a lot of money. Find a substance that people will have a craving for once they come in contact with it. Then find a way to deliver it. They may or may not be aware that once they first try it, they may not be able to quit. But if you use persuasive advertising to make it seem attractive, you will get a few to start and the numbers will grow. And your dollars will flow.
Recognize the scenario? It happened millennia ago, and tobacco merchants prospered. More recently, it happened again with the vaping merchants. As beguiling as this scheme might be, I believe it should be made illegal. Who knows? The product you want to sell could turn out be harmful or even fatal to people's health.

Deservedly on track
Last week, I sent an "unsubscribe" request to "Team Ben Ray" in an effort to stop the endless stream of insufferable emails. In that request I stated that I found Rep. Luján's fundraising style to be sensationalistic, manipulative and an insult to my intelligence. Shortly after sending my request, I opened today's New Mexican to find that Milan Simonich was making the exact same point in much greater detail, not to mention to a much wider audience ("Rep Luján always meets cash haul deadlines," Ringside Seat, Dec. 6).
I am a firm supporter of Rep.Luján and his bid to move from the U.S. House to the U.S. Senate, but I'm hard-pressed to understand how a contribution to his campaign is going to help defeat Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell in Kentucky. I sincerely hope that the man who is deservedly on track to be one of New Mexico's senators for years to come will start communicating to his constituents in a manner that is substantive, respectful and devoid of the obnoxious rhetoric all too typical these days of congressional Republicans and Fox News.

No fixing it
Letter writer Adam Wasserman ("Don't want injuries," Letters to the Editor, Dec. 6), complains of water condensation at the Genoveva Chavez Community Center and calls for "giving them the resources they need" to repair it. We already tried that. The Chavez Center was a $25 million engineering disaster from the time it was built in 1999 because of a fundamental design flaw, a heated swimming pool and an ice rink under the same metal roof, which cause it to "sweat" with condensate.
In 2015, the city spent $1.2 million to replace the dehumidifier, after failure of the $500,000 dehumidifier that was installed in 2010. On Jan. 11, 2010, The New Mexican published an article under the headline, "Genoveva Chavez Community Center plagued by leaks for a decade." The building cannot be fixed. We should raze it and cease dreaming that city government is competent to build and operate a recreation center.

Front-page news
Thank you for reporting on how humans are doing in fending off climate catastrophe in an article by Brad Plume of the New York Times ("Carbon dioxide emissions hit record," Dec. 4) below the fold on Page B-5. I feel like it was buried. Maybe placing this under the weather report was intentional. Is it possible to place climate change updates on your front page? I need what's most important first to make my life-or-death choices.
Climate change is an extreme emergency. Provide climate change updates on the front page of The New Mexican.

North LA County’s Assemblywoman Christy Smith gets Nancy Pelosi’s endorsement for Katie Hill’s old seat

Texto completo: SANTA CLARITA — State Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who’s running for California’s 25th Congressional District seat, on Wednesday won the endorsement of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
“California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith is a proven leader,” Pelosi said in a statement. “I am proud to endorse Christy Smith because she will work to fight corruption, lower the cost of prescription drugs, fully fund public schools and build a strong middle-class economy that works for all Americans.”
Smith currently represents California’ 38th Assembly District, which includes Santa Clarita, Simi Valley, Valencia, Saugus, Canyon Country, Stevenson Ranch, Newhall, Chatsworth, Porter Ranch, Granada Hills, and Agua Dulce. The Assemblywoman lives in Newhall, with her husband Phil, along with their two daughters, Chelsea and Chandler.
She entered the race after former Rep. Katie Hill resigned.
Hill also was in the good graces of Pelosi, saying as recently as this weekend in an New York Times op-ed that Pelosi did not force her to resign after facing an ethics committee investigation into whether she had engaged in an affair with a male congressional staffer, which she denied and which would have broken House rules. Hill, who identifies as bisexual, acknowledged having a consensual affair with a female aide on her campaign.
After that resignation, Smith wasted no time in announcing a bid for the seat, which Hill had flipped from red to blue after years of being a GOP stronghold.
Political experts give Smith, who also recently received the endorsement of Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Burbank, a good chance to win in the March 2020 primary, and ultimately the seat, given that it’s on the same day as the presidential primary, which is expected to bring many Democratic voters to the polls, and the fact that the district itself has been trending blue anyway.
All told, seven Democrats are vying for the seat, including Cenk Uygur, a political commentator, and Christopher Smith, who touts his progressive approach.
On the GOP side, Steve Knight, whom Hill ousted after two terms representing the area, is running to try and get his old seat back. And the field still includes a bevvy of Republicans who aren’t giving in just because some bigger names are entering.
In addition to Garcia — who said his run is based on “Constitution, capitalism and competition” — there’s nonprofit CEO Suzette Martinez Valladares, who claimed earlier this year Garcia is “bought and paid for” by political elites and failed to vote in most recent elections. There’s Lancaster City Councilwoman Angela Underwood Jacobs and L.A. County Sheriff’s Deputy Mark Cripe.
And there’s George Papadopoulos, the former trump campaign aide, who announced his candidacy on “Fox & Friends.”
City News Service and Daily News City Editor Ryan contributed to this report.

Texto completo: To the Editor:
"Public Was Duped on Afghan War" (front page, Dec. 10) illustrates in a shocking way what happens when a country acts with ignorance about its intended beneficiary, hubris about its omnipotence, muddled thinking about its strategy and recklessness about the use of its resources. On every count the results of our well-intended actions in Afghanistan have been a failure.
We should keep this lesson well in mind when in the future we seek "monsters to destroy," in the words of John Quincy Adams.
This is a textbook example of how a society destroys itself. Let's hope that our children can forgive us for the way we squandered their inheritance.

Texto completo: A former history professor rebuts an Op-Ed writer's thesis that Mr. Trump's words and actions are not so different from those of previous presidents.
To the Editor:
"Trump's Rhetoric Has Precedent," by Philip Terzian (Op-Ed, Dec. 10), was a misguided and ahistorical attempt to normalize President Trump's rhetoric and actions by comparing him to former presidents.
While F.D.R. used fireside chats to reach out to the public, they were nothing like Mr. Trump's tweets. F.D.R. tried to calm and explain complex issues to the public; Mr. Trump uses his tweets to provoke conflict and misunderstanding.
Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush certainly had their critics and were considered lightweights by many, but they understood how the government worked and made an effort to promote unity.
And Theodore Roosevelt was impulsive, but not on a daily basis, and did not consistently flip-flop on important issues. Most of all, no former president appeared to do the bidding of America's enemy.
Mr. Trump, despite what Mr. Terzian says, is a threat to democracy in a way that even Richard Nixon didn't approach.

Texto completo: Jesé Milagrosa, líder espiritual de una pequeña iglesia en Bayside (Queens, NYC), ha sido acusado de agredir sexualmente a un pre adolescente en el transcurso de tres años.
Milagrosa (69), líder de la Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette en la calle 204, supuestamente usó su posición en la iglesia para participar en actos sexuales con el niño de 12 años entre 2011 y 2014, informó Queens Daily Eagle.
La víctima no identificada es miembro activo de la feligresía y se enfrentó a Milagrosa con respecto al abuso en 2018.
El acusado luego admitió a los detectives que tuvo contacto oral y anal con el niño , dijeron los fiscales.
Los fiscales acusaron a Milagrosa de conducta sexual contra un menor de edad y de actos sexuales criminales. Está detenido con una fianza de $250 mil dólares y debe regresar a la corte el 20 de diciembre. Si es declarado culpable, enfrenta entre 10 años y prisión perpetua.
La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora de La Salette, un templo católica fundado en el año 2000, celebra una misa tradicional en latín al menos seis días a la semana, y muchos de los feligreses son inmigrantes de América del Sur.
A raíz de su arresto, un portavoz de la Diócesis de Brooklyn, que incluye Queens, dijo que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no es una Iglesia Católica Romana y no es parte de la Diócesis de Brooklyn.
“Si bien imita muchas prácticas católicas, no es una parroquia católica romana, y no está asociada con la Diócesis de Brooklyn”, dijo el portavoz. “De hecho, la diócesis ha notificado a los fieles a lo largo de los años que Nuestra Señora de LaSalette no está en comunión con la diócesis o con el Santo Padre”.
El abogado de Milagrosa, Jeffrey Pittell, dijo que él “es amado por su congregación”.
Según una entrevista en 2007 con The New York Times, “Monseñor Milagrosa” se mudó a NYC desde Venezuela en 1985, “después de crear una orden religiosa independiente, ahora con sede en Liberty, Nueva York, con la esperanza de aumentar las vocaciones entre los jóvenes hispanos”.

Criminal justice system less racially biased, but still bad, especially for African Americans

Texto completo: Racial biases in the criminal justice system have started to decline, according to new research by the bipartisan Council on Criminal Justice, but that is no reason to celebrate. Mostly black and brown faces still fill the country's jails and prisons, and people of color make up most of the parole and probation rolls. The work is not done until the gap is eliminated and the unfair targeting of people of color has ended.
Still, the strides the report outlined shouldn't be ignored. The imprisonment rate for black men decreased for all crime categories except public order offenses, such as disorderly conduct and public drunkenness, according to the report, which analyzed data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics spanning 2000 to 2016. African Americans were incarcerated at a rate 8.3 times higher than white people in 2000, and for Hispanic people the rate was 2.6 times higher. By 2016 those ratios dropped to 5.1 to 1 and 1.6 to 1, respectively, according to the study.
While that represents progress, African Americans are still five times more likely to be imprisoned than white people and Hispanics nearly twice as likely, and both imbalances are wholly unacceptable. The culture of locking up people of color, whether because of unconscious biases our outright discrimination, is still alive and well. Just recently, The New York Times reported that police officers said they were told by a commander to go after blacks and Latinos for minor offenses like jumping turnstiles. Leave Asians and whites alone, they were instructed.
If there is a bright spot to the numbers, it's that they offer encouragement to those who have kept issues like mass incarceration, mandatory minimums and unfair sentencing in the spotlight. It adds even more credence to the good work of groups like the Innocence Project that have worked, sometimes on shoestring budgets, to free those who have been wrongly convicted based on trumped up charges, coerced confessions and bad witness testimony. All of this activism has helped keep up the pressure to end biases by showing the tragic result such disparities in sentencing and imprisonment have. It's well documented people with prison records have a hard time getting jobs and that incarceration breaks up families. We need more resources directed at these issues, and these groups need to keep plowing ahead to keep the biases in law enforcement at the forefront.
Researchers with the Council on Criminal Justice say they will use the data collected to come up with policies that can help further erode the disparities in the system. They concede that outcomes vary by race and type of crime, making it hard to point to a single cause for the disparities. The largest drop in racial disparity occurred for drug offenses, which also correlated with a drop in disparity of those who were jailed. We need to know more about why those drops occurred and whether similar principles should be applied in other areas.
Researchers also should conduct an analysis by state and region to see if the problem is more pronounced in certain parts of the country. Do factors such as past crime history impact whether or not someone ends up in jail again? In other words, is the prison pipeline cycle perpetuating itself? Also, how do police departments change a culture in which police officers scrutinize people of color more intensely than white residents? Racial bias, bail reform and the over-policing of low income neighborhoods are all areas ripe for reform.
Adam Gelb, president and chief executive of the Council on Criminal Justice, told various news outlets that he was heartened the disparities turned out to be "a bad problem that's getting a little better, and for very complex reasons that we need to understand at a much deeper level."
The problem clearly still exists, but we give the council credit for moving the conversation along and giving more evidence of the need for further research and reform.

HOUSE LAWYERS SPAR OVER IMPEACHMENT GOP COUNSEL CRITICIZES DEMOCRATS' MOTIVES

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - Lawyers sparred before the House Judiciary Committee on Monday over whether President Donald Trump should be removed from office, as the committee's Democratic majority pledged to move forward on preparing articles of impeachment over Republican members' objections.
In opening arguments during the morning session, two lawyers representing the Democrats outlined their case on why Mr. Trump's actions justified the historic measure of impeachment.
Mr. Trump's pressure on the Ukrainian government to investigate a political rival, the lawyers argued, met all the requirements for Congress to take such a historic and dramatic measure. Moving quickly, they argued, was necessary because the president was threatening the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.
"The evidence is overwhelming," said Barry Berke, counsel for the Democratic majority. "The president's actions have left no choice."
Daniel Goldman, the second lawyer, said the president posed a "clear and present danger" to U.S. elections and national security.
Two lawyers representing Republicans, meanwhile, criticized the Democrats' motives for pursuing impeachment and sought to discredit the evidence and witnesses. Last week, the House Intelligence Committee released a 300-page report on its findings, concluding that Mr. Trump has abused his power for personal and political gain.
Democrats are moving to impeach "not because they have evidence of high crimes and misdemeanors, but because they disagree with his policies," said Stephen Castor, counsel for the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee.
"The evidentiary record is incomplete and, in many places, is incoherent," Mr. Castor said.
The evidence methodically presented by the lawyers at Monday's hearing will form the central legal tenets of Mr. Trump's likely impeachment trial in the Senate.
Democrats were hoping to establish Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy fit the textbook definition for what America's founders most feared when they granted Congress the power of impeachment.
Mr. Burke laid out what he called the "ABCs" of impeachment: abuse of power, betrayal of the national interest and corruption of U.S. elections.
"Most extraordinarily . President Trump did not violate one of these - but all three," Mr. Burke said. His conduct "checks all three boxes."
Mr. Burke, followed by Mr. Goldman, showed video clips from testimony from the slew of public hearings before the House Intelligence Committee, spurred by a whistleblower report made public in September.
They displayed text messages among diplomats discussing Mr. Trump's request for Ukraine to make a public announcement of an investigation into Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joe Biden, had sat on the board. The elder Biden is a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
One text message sent by Bill Taylor, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, sent on Sept. 9 to Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, and another diplomat read: "As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."
The message was clear, Mr. Berke said - the Ukrainians would not receive U.S. military aid or a meeting with the White House "unless they further President Trump's re-election efforts. That is a corrupt abuse of power."
The lawyers also sought to use Mr. Trump's own words against him. They played video of Mr. Trump calling on China to investigate the Bidens and video of the news conference in which White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney effectively admitted to a quid pro quo.
Meanwhile, Republicans and their counsel focused on critiquing the process as unfair and arguing Democrats did not have hard evidence.
"Where's the impeachable offense? Why are we here?" said Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., the top Republican on the committee. "We don't have a crime."
Mr. Castor, the Republican counsel, said Democrats were "obsessed" with impeachment and that their inquiry is "clearly an orchestrated effort to upend our political system."
"Democrats have been searching for a set of facts to impeach President Trump since his inauguration," Mr. Castor said.
The White House, which has called the impeachment inquiry a "sham," did not send representatives to defend the president in the hearing.
Yet Mr. Trump tweeted dozens of times Sunday and Monday about the impeachment hearing, assailing Democrats.
As with previous hearings, there were partisan flare-ups.
Republican members frequently interrupted the hearing during the morning session to needle Judiciary Committee chair Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.,, demanding a hearing for the GOP minority and criticizing his handling of procedure.
When Mr. Nadler shut down those requests, the Republicans asked for a roll call vote, in which votes are read aloud individually and recorded.
Some Republicans smiled in delight and exasperation as their colleagues shouted objections and parliamentary inquiries.
Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., jumped in to air grievances over the time committee members were given to review the evidence.
"How are we expected to process 8,000 pages of documents?" Mr. Reschenthaler said over the gaveling of Mr. Nadler. "If this were a court of law, you'd be facing sanctions by the bar association."
Mr. Nadler admonished him: "Gentleman will suspend and not make a speech."
Members of the Judiciary Committee were each allowed five minutes to question the lawyers.
Mr. Reschenthaler, speaking toward the end of a lengthy afternoon session, again came to the president's defense.
"Democrats don't want to talk about the red-hot Trump economy," enabled by renegotiating trade deals and rolling back regulations, Mr. Reschenthaler said. "This whole process is just a distraction - an attempt to hide the far-left radical agenda."
As Mr. Reschenthaler had said before, he does not believe Mr. Trump put pressure on Ukraine in return for a political favor and that anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine were justified.
"Ukrainian attempts to interfere in the 2016 election are well-documented, and that's troubling," he said. "We should be here hearing from Hunter Biden."
The Judiciary Committee is expected to move forward on articles of impeachment and could vote as soon as this week.

Texto completo: A reader who is also a McKinsey alum explains that the young Pete Buttigieg would have had little choice in what he worked on. Also: Ending a life full of pain; the art of managing one's time.
Editors' Note: This letter has been updated to reflect developments.
To the Editor:
Re "Buttigieg Bid for Transparency Derails at McKinsey" (news article, Dec. 8):
I am a retired biotechnology executive and an alum of McKinsey & Company, having worked there from 1990 to 1993. Despite having many issues with McKinsey's recent choice of clients (ICE, Saudi Arabia, Purdue Pharma, etc.), I find the idea that Pete Buttigieg is hiding something nefarious about his time there ridiculous.
Coming straight out of school with no prior business experience, he would have spent a couple of years as a glorified analyst, and maybe some time as a junior project manager. He would have had no decision-making authority about what he worked on, would not have been in any position to make policy and is truly not allowed to talk about his clients.
Most people running for president have confidential information in their past, whether as lawyers or as legislators or as businesspeople. That doesn't mean that it's sleazy -- just that it's a competitive world where organizations need to keep secrets from their competitors. I for one believe that it's important for our leaders to understand and value the private sector.
McKinsey has now released Pete from his confidentiality agreement after his clients agreed to waive their confidentiality provisions. The situation shouldn't be a reflection on Pete's ethical standards. There is no sign that he wasn't an ethical person during these years or any others.

A Death Journey
To the Editor:
Re "The End," by Andrew Keh, with photographs and additional reporting by Lynsey Addario (Special report, Dec. 8):
Thank you to Marieke Vervoort for allowing The New York Times to chronicle her journey through physician-assisted death. Until we can talk about death openly without fear, we will continue to live in a country that prioritizes quantity of days over quality of life.
Ms. Vervoort faced unenviable pain but was at least fortunate to live in a country, Belgium, that allowed her to face death on her own terms. This was excellent, heart-wrenching reporting.

Learning to Manage My Time, Outside My Comfort Zone
To the Editor:
Re "Our Schools Can't Solve the Problems of Our Rigid Workweek," by Gracy Olmstead (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 14):
As a child of a full-time working mom, I have had my fair share of long after-school nights in some interesting places. (I'll never forget dinner at the principal's house.)
Now as a college student, I have the luxury of "D.I.Y.-ing" my school schedule based on my desire to sleep in on Mondays and head out of school by noon on Fridays.
But more important, my nontraditional schedule makes space for my yoga and cooking classes, allowing me to pursue my passions and experience new things outside my comfort zone. This flexibility has given me the breathing space I need to experiment and invest in the things that matter to me as an individual and aspiring professional.
While one can't deny that the manner in which I process material and adopt learning skills has changed since my time as a young child in elementary school, what if they haven't changed so much? What if we tried a 9-to-2 school day followed by an elongated version of the after-school experiences on the basketball court or on the theater stage that taught me about teamwork, problem solving and creativity?
Perhaps the exploratory journey of who I am could have begun much sooner -- perhaps on the playground or during volunteer work (but probably not at dinner with the principal and her family).

Texto completo: Millennials are gobbling down plant-based burgers, prompting meat producers to question the health benefits of "ultra-processed imitations."
The meat industry has a warning for consumers: Beware of plant-based meat.
That is the message behind a marketing campaign by the Center for Consumer Freedom, a public relations firm whose financial supporters have included meat producers and others in the food industry. In recent weeks the group has placed full-page ads in The New York Times and other newspapers raising health concerns about plant-based meat substitutes like the Impossible Burger and the Beyond Burger, which are designed to look, taste and even appear to bleed like real meat.
The ads call them "ultra-processed imitations" with numerous ingredients. "What's hiding in your plant-based meat?" asks one ad featuring a sad face made of two patties and sausage. Another directs readers to a site that compares plant-based burgers to dog food. In November, the group's managing director, Will Coggin, wrote an opinion piece in USA Today that labeled fake meats as ultra-processed foods that can spur weight gain, although the research on processed foods has not included plant-based meats. A few days later, the center's executive director, Rick Berman, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal criticizing plant-based meats as highly processed and no healthier than meat. Its headline: "'Plant-Based Meat' Is All Hat and No Cattle."
Impossible Foods, which makes a popular plant-based burger, said the campaign was misleading and fear-mongering. The company says plant-based meat alternatives are better for consumers and better for the planet, requiring less land and water and producing fewer greenhouse gas emissions than meat from cattle. The new "disinformation" campaign, they say, is a sign that Impossible Foods' mission -- to disrupt the meat industry and replace animals in the food system -- is working. "It's a point of pride to have that organization come after us," said Pat Brown, the company's chief executive. "It's hard to imagine a stronger endorsement." (The Center for Consumer Freedom did not respond to requests for an interview.)
Unlike other vegetarian meat substitutes, the new plant-based burgers are winning over meat lovers. The market research firm NPD Group says that 90 percent of the customers purchasing them are meat-eaters who believe the products are more healthful and better for the environment, said Darren Seifer, an analyst at NPD, which recently predicted that plant-based meats will have staying power because of their popularity with millennials.
"The two big brands, Beyond and Impossible, have replicated the burger experience without having to sacrifice the taste of the burger," he said. "So now a lot of consumers feel like they have a healthier option, they are reducing the amount of meat they consume, and they just feel better about that."
But are plant-based meats really better for you than meat? It depends on how you eat them, said Dr. Frank Hu, chairman of the nutrition department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Replacing a hamburger with a plant burger is not an improvement in diet quality if you chase it with French fries and a sugar-laden soda, Dr. Hu said.
For consumers trying to choose the healthiest option, Dr. Hu said studies comparing the metabolic effects of eating beef burgers versus plant burgers are currently underway. In the meantime, he considers the meat substitutes "transitional foods" for people who are trying to adopt more healthful diets.
In August, Dr. Hu, along with a group of health and climate experts, published a report in JAMA that explored whether plant-based meats can be part of a "healthy low-carbon diet." Studies show that replacing red meat with nuts, legumes and other plant foods can lower mortality and chronic disease risk, but it's not possible to extrapolate that processed burgers made with purified soy or pea protein will have the same health benefits, said Dr. Hu.
Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat say the building blocks of their burgers are plants. The Beyond Burger has about 18 ingredients, including purified pea protein, coconut and canola oils, rice protein, potato starch and beet juice extract for coloring. Beyond Meat says it uses no genetically modified or artificially produced ingredients.
The Impossible Burger is made with similar basic ingredients but it gets its protein largely from soy and potato, and it uses an iron-containing compound from soy called heme to enhance the burger's meaty flavor. Both products use methylcellulose, a plant derivative commonly used in sauces and ice cream, as a binder.
Compared to a beef patty, the Impossible and Beyond burgers have similar amounts of protein and calories, with less saturated fat and no cholesterol. They also contain fiber; real meat does not. But compared to real beef, the two plant-based burgers are considerably higher in sodium, containing about 16 percent of the recommended daily value. An uncooked four-ounce beef patty has about 75 milligrams of sodium, compared to 370 milligrams of sodium in the Impossible Burger and 390 milligrams in the Beyond Burger.
This fall, Burger King said it had its most successful quarter in four years, driven by sales of its plant-based Impossible Whopper. Dunkin' Donuts announced it was rolling out a breakfast sandwich made with Beyond Meat sausages in 9,000 of its stores after a successful trial run in New York City. More than 50,000 grocery stores and restaurants, including fast food chains like Subway, White Castle, KFC and Carl's Jr., carry products from Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods.
Despite the popularity of plant-based burgers, beef burgers are still overwhelmingly the more popular choice at restaurants. Americans purchased 6.4 billion beef burgers at quick service restaurants during the 12 months that ended in May, compared to 228 million plant-based burgers in the same period.
While meat consumption in America is at an all-time high, many Americans have shifted from eating beef to poultry. In the past three decades, beef intake has fallen by about a third, while chicken intake has more than doubled and pork intake has remained fairly steady. Studies show that cost, convenience and health concerns are among the top reasons Americans have cut back on beef.
But the health messages about red meat have been confusing. Earlier this year, a group of scientists challenged decades of nutrition advice, saying that warnings linking red meat consumption to heart disease and cancer are not backed by strong scientific evidence, though it was later revealed that the study's lead author had past research ties to an industry group whose members include fast food companies and a beef processor.
Meat producers are taking the fight against fake meat to lawmakers. At least 25 states have introduced bills making it illegal to use the words "beef" or "meat" on products made from plant ingredients or cultured meat that is grown in a lab. Missouri became the first state to pass such a law last year, which was initially proposed by the Missouri Cattlemen's Association.
In October, Representative Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas and the top recipient of livestock industry donations in the House, introduced a federal bill that would require companies to put the word "imitation" on their plant-based meat products. The bill calls for the products to carry a statement on their packages "that clearly indicates the product is not derived from or does not contain meat."
Dr. Marshall, an obstetrician, said he introduced the bill after hearing from constituents. Patients of his told him they were confused about the health benefits of plant-based beef substitutes, and beef producers told him they were frustrated that the products are sold in grocery stores next to ground beef. "Kansas has a very large beef industry and they said, 'Why are we allowing this fake meat in the meat department?"' he said.
Mr. Brown, the chief executive of Impossible Foods, said his company's mission is not to convince consumers that the Impossible Burger is the most nutritious food they can eat. It is simply to persuade people who want a "cow burger" to eat an Impossible Burger instead.
"The niche that this fills is not the same niche that a kale salad fills," he said. "If you're hungry for a burger and you want something that's better for you and better for the planet that delivers everything you want from a burger, then this is a great product. But if you're hungry for a salad, eat a salad."

Texto completo: Chinese officials have released social media videos, blistering editorials and attacks on researchers in a push to counter evidence of its Muslim internment drive.
BEIJING -- On Twitter and YouTube, with slick videos and strident editorials, the Chinese government has gone on the offensive to reject mounting evidence that it is detaining Muslims in droves, depicting its critics as players in a Western conspiracy.
China's aggressive media campaign comes after exposés published by The New York Times and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists about the government's drive to detain a million or more members of largely Muslim minority groups in indoctrination camps. The reports, which used leaked official documents to reveal the coercive workings of the camps in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, sharpened international criticism of China's ruling Communist Party.
The pushback from China has escalated in recent days after the United States House of Representatives last week overwhelmingly supported a bill that could impose sanctions on Chinese officials overseeing the internment drive.
Chinese officials have accused Western lawmakers, experts and news outlets of maligning the government's policies and stirring ethnic discord in Xinjiang.
At a news conference in Beijing on Monday, Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the Xinjiang government, dismissed the congressional bill as "crude meddling in China's internal affairs."
He sought to foil the criticism by saying that the facilities -- which Beijing calls vocational training centers -- were now holding only people who were there voluntarily. Others who were previously in the facilities had "graduated," he said, providing no specifics and declining to say whether they had been released.
He would not say how many people were currently or previously held. Uighurs and Kazakhs abroad have said they have seen no evidence of large-scale releases.
Beijing's case appears unlikely to win over experts who include officials from the United Nations. An abundance of evidence shows that the authorities have pursued a sweeping campaign to detain Uighurs and Kazakhs in camps designed to turn them into loyal supporters of the Communist Party.
Maya Wang, a senior China researcher for Human Rights Watch who has closely studied Xinjiang, said the party's claims lacked credibility. "This comes from a government that pretty much lies about most reports coming from the region," she said.
"If the Chinese government has indeed released people from the camps," she added, "then it should allow independent observers, including from the United Nations, to enter the region without any kind of restrictions to see for themselves."
Beijing has said that its policies in Xinjiang are aimed at curbing extremism and have pulled the region back from bloody anarchy. The latest media campaign reflects the government's confidence that its narrative could undermine independent Western analysis and news reports on the region, and perhaps blunt the push in some countries to censure China over the hard-line policies.
On Twitter and in Chinese newspapers, Chinese commentators have accused prominent Western scholars of serving as tools of American intelligence agencies regarding Xinjiang. Twitter is banned within China, but that does not stop the government and its supporters from using the platform to make their case that the camps have stamped out attacks in Xinjiang.
The Global Times, a newspaper owned by the Chinese Communist Party, published an interview with a regional government spokesman who said that two prominent foreign experts on Xinjiang, Adrian Zenz and Darren Byler, were cooperating with "anti-China forces in the U.S. to smear China's Xinjiang policies."
Mr. Byler, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder, and Mr. Zenz, a senior fellow in China Studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, said the attack on them seemed to reflect growing anxiety among Chinese officials that they were losing the international argument over the camps.
"Painting me and Darren Byler as intelligence agents is a very poorly done, crude, smearing counterattack," Mr. Zenz said. "I think it's very unconvincing. People are not believing them anymore."
Not all of China's media offensive has dwelled on the claims of success in Xinjiang. China's state-run international broadcaster, CGTN, posted several English-language videos on YouTube featuring footage of what it said were earlier attacks by Uighurs swept up in extremism and separatist movements.
The government showed one of the videos to journalists on Monday that included gruesome scenes from a 2014 attack by Uighur militants at a railway station in Kunming, in southwestern China, that killed 31 people and injured 141 others.
"The horrific images and alarming number of violent crimes reveal the seriousness of the security situation in China's western frontier," the English-language voice-over says. "Chinese police have identified Xinjiang as a key battlefield."
Mr. Byler said the videos could help deflect criticism of the detentions by playing on exaggerated fears that Uighurs are susceptible to becoming terrorists. But the videos avoid fundamental questions about whether the scale of the government's response is appropriate, he said.
"They are missing that point where they go from 'This handful of people did bad things' to 'We need to lock up 1.8 million or however many people are estimated in camps,"' Mr. Byler said.
Former camp detainees who have left China have described numbing, harsh and even brutal treatment inside the facilities. Detainees are subject to constant indoctrination that warns them to renounce religious fervor and support the Communist Party. They are forced to study Chinese, memorize laws, practice marching and learn skills for factory work.
Legal experts have said that even under China's sweeping powers of detention, there is no sound backing for the camps, which subject inmates to months or years of detention without trial or effective means of appeal. Last month, six experts and officials on United Nations human rights panels also criticized the regulations that China has cited to justify the mass detentions, saying that the rules were "incompatible with China's obligations under international human rights law."
China has also continued to put tremendous pressure on former detainees and other Uighurs who have spoken out about the campaign from abroad. Asiye Abdulaheb, a Uighur woman in the Netherlands who said she was involved in the release of the 24 pages of documents published by news outlets last month, has described being harassed and threatened.
"The Chinese police would definitely find us," she said in an interview on Saturday. She described Chinese security officers as telling her ex-husband: "We know about all your matters. We have a lot of people in the Netherlands."

Texto completo: White man is accused of killing black student at U-Md. campus bus stop
dek goes here goe here
goe shere goes
here goes here
The surveillance video of the stabbing is clear, according to prosecutors: Sean Urbanski stands in the shadows before approaching a group of three college students at a University of Maryland bus stop. He walks past another man, who, like Urbanski, is white. He bypasses an Asian woman. And then he confronts the only black person in the group.
'Step left, step left if you know what's best for you,' Urbanski warns before fatally stabbing Richard Collins III with a folding knife, police alleged in charging documents.
Urbanski, according to his defense attorneys, was 'out-of-his-mind drunk' at the time. Eight hours after he was arrested in Collins's slaying, his attorneys said, Urbanski showed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10, higher than the legal limit in Maryland of 0.08.
A year and a half after the killing, a jury is expected to weigh evidence and testimony about whether Urbanski is guilty of murder in Collins's slaying and, if so, whether the fatal stabbing was a planned, racially motivated attack or the actions of an intoxicated person who did not act intentionally. Central to the hate-crime charge, according to experts, is how the jury will interpret racially charged material that Urbanski had on his phone in the months leading up to the stabbing and his state of mind during the attack.
Jury selection began Monday for an expected two-week trial in Prince George's County Circuit Court, where Urbanski, of Severna Park, was indicted on charges of first-degree murder and a hate crime resulting in death.
Frederick M. Lawrence, an expert on hate crimes and a lecturer at Georgetown University Law Center, said the case 'is a pretty classic presentation of a hate-crime trial where one of the hardest things to demonstrate is the biased motivation.'
'People are inclined to think that if you are racist and committed an interracial crime, you committed a hate crime,' Lawrence said. 'But there has to be a causal link between racial animus and the crime.'
Collins, a newly commissioned second lieutenant in the Army, was killed May 20, 2017. Days away from graduating from Bowie State University, the 23-year-old had spent the evening visiting friends at the University of Maryland at College Park when the fatal encounter occurred, according to police. Urbanski, according to police, remained near the scene after the stabbing and was found with a folding knife in his pocket.
A jury would need to find Urbanski guilty of murder or manslaughter before deciding whether he is also guilty of a hate crime. Maryland law says a person may not kill because of 'another's race, color, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or national origin, or because another is homeless.'
Lawrence said that hate-crime charges are relatively rare but that when they are used, their conviction rates are roughly similar to conviction rates for other charges.
Prosecutors are expected to zero in on what they deemed racist content found on Urbanski's phone and his interaction with the material in the months preceding Collins's killing, including his alleged association with a Facebook page called Alt-Reich: Nation.
Between Christmas Day 2016 and April 18, 2017, Urbanski interacted with content that included the image of a noose and a gun or with material that referred to black DNA or racist jokes, according to a judge's description of the images detailed at a pretrial hearing for Urbanski.
Urbanski's lawyers unsuccessfully tried to exclude the offensive material found on their client's phone from being used at trial, but they were able to block the state from calling an expert to testify about Alt-Reich.
'The defendant has never been a member of the Alt-Reich,' Urbanski's lawyers William C. Brennan and John McKenna argued in court filings that said the expert's testimony would confuse and prejudice the jury. 'Nevertheless, the State plans to introduce evidence the defendant was a member of a Facebook group called the 'Alt-Reich: Nation' which is not and has never been part of the 'Alt-Reich' political group/movement.'
Although University of Maryland police said the Facebook page included racist and inflammatory material, Brennan, in previous court hearings, said the group's founders have denied affiliations with white supremacy. Citing a New York Times article featuring interviews with a group administrator and someone who founded the group, Brennan said the Facebook page was meant as satire.
Urbanski's attorneys face a difficult battle, said Deborah Sines, who for nine years prosecuted cases involving racial violence for the criminal section of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division before becoming a homicide prosecutor in the office of the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. Urbanski's supposed level of intoxication is not necessarily a defense, she said.
'It goes to his state of mind, and the defense will, of course, argue to a jury he didn't know what he was doing,' Sines said. 'The problem with that defense is the two people who were passed up.'
Sines said the experts who can describe how Urbanski interacted with the material on his phone could also be key. At previous court hearings, Urbanski's attorneys said there was no evidence about whether Urbanski had sought out the inflammatory material or had received it unsolicited.
'The trick to this case is for the defense to prove there is insufficient proof of racial animus, and the only way they can do that is to say: 'Do not believe what is in his phone. It doesn't mean anything,' ' Sines said.
However, Principal Deputy State's Attorney Jason B. Abbott said at a previous court hearing that there was a simple explanation for the images that addresses why only one of the people at the bus stop was stabbed.
Opening statements are expected to start Wednesday once jury selection concludes.

Texto completo: Of the millions of quotable lines from The Princess Bride, my family took Westley's famous "life is pain" quote and modified it into a family motto of, "Nothing in life is fair." That motto popped into mind while I read an op-ed by Rachel McKinnon about dominating women's cycling competitions, breaking world records, and winning championships, all while being thrust into a larger spotlight due to the controversy surrounding a biological male competing against females.

You can’t help but be sympathetic to the situation McKinnon is in. She writes in the New York Times:
Many want me to race against men. I have news for them: I’m not allowed. I’m legally female. My birth certificate, passport, driver’s license, U.S. permanent resident card, medical records and my racing license all have an “F” on them. The Union Cycliste Internationale, USACycling, Cycling Canada, the Canadian and United States governments and the state of South Carolina all agree that I’m female. The rules require me to race in the women’s category. That’s exactly where I belong: I am a woman, after all. I am female as well.
Unfortunately for McKinnon, that’s now how life works. It doesn’t matter what documents or governments or organizations may purport: A man cannot become a woman and equalize the physical and physiological differences between the sexes.
In the op-ed, McKinnon delves into the myriad differences between competitors, physical, sociological, etc. But the fact remains, men’s and women’s sports are separate for good reason; men are on the whole stronger and faster than women. People are upset with McKinnon’s victories because they know that they represent not just a singular case of unfairness, but one that will only get worse for female athletes.
The situation for transgender athletes put McKinnon in a difficult position — unable to compete with men, but derided for competing against women. This is an injustice all of society has perpetrated: a lie that a man can become a woman simply by virtue of feeling like one, and similarly for a woman becoming a man. It’s not just society perpetuating this lie, but governments and sporting organizations as well.
Feeling like a woman and declaring oneself as one does not, and cannot, erase the biological differences and innate advantages of the sexes. I will never be as fast of a runner as most men, but no man can ever give birth to or nurse a baby.
In the conclusion of the op-ed, McKinnon asserts, “It is a human right to be able to compete.” This is absolutely ludicrous. One does not have a “right” to compete in a sport, especially in a division one is unqualified to participate in. McKinnon is concerned with just McKinnon, without any understanding of how it must feel for competitors to be defeated by someone with a clear and undeniable biological advantage.
McKinnon may not care about the women in masters cycling or any other sport, but we should, before any other women’s sporting event is similarly dominated unfairly by biological men.

Pitching is costly -- will Cubs, Sox pay?

Texto completo: When the Cubs signed Jon Lester to a six-year, $155 million deal here at the 2014 winter meetings, his former manager with the Red Sox, Terry Francona, was asked if he thought the lure of ending another championship drought factored into Lester's decision.
"Well, that and $150-something million, probably," Francona replied.
Lester became the second-highest-paid pitcher in the game, after the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw, and helped the Cubs end their drought, making the deal a winner after only two years.
But that contract was dwarfed by David Price's seven-year, $217 million deal with the Red Sox one year later, and four years after that, Price's record-setting deal for a pitcher figures to be surpassed this winter by Gerrit Cole and perhaps by Stephen Strasburg as well.
There has always been a stated desire by teams to add quality starting pitching this time of year. But now it appears more urgent than ever, even as starters are throwing fewer innings thanks to pitch counts and bullpens filled with relievers who throw in the upper 90s.
Amazingly, only 22 starters pitched 190 or more innings in 2019, about one-third the number (63) who threw that many innings only 20 years ago in 1999, a year in which 77 pitchers made 29 or more starts. This year only 43 pitchers made as many as 29 starts, and only two -- Shane Bieber and Lucas Giolito -- had three complete games.
But the cost of elite starters continues to soar, and this year's free agents are the beneficiaries of the boom market. Last October saw a World Series that featured six of the highest-paid and most dominant starters -- Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke of the Astros and Strasburg, Max Scherzer and Patrick Corbin of the Nationals -- proving again the most important part of the roster puzzle is building a strong rotation.
"There's never enough pitching," Scherzer said after winning the World Series. "Hopefully people will start spending money on pitching. Wouldn't that be great?"
Well, they already are, as evidenced by Zack Wheeler's five-year, $118 million deal with the Phillies, which got the pitching market started with a bang last week. Even Cole Hamels, who posted a 7.36 ERA over eight starts during the Cubs' stretch run after returning from an oblique injury, managed to get a one-year, $18 million deal with the Braves. The Cubs gave Hamels one start in St. Louis on the final weekend of the season to prove he was healthy, and those four scoreless innings may have added a couple of million to his value, even for a meaningless outing.
And this is just the start. According to the New York Times, the Yankees already are preparing to offer Cole a seven-year, $245 million deal, which would eclipse Greinke's highest annual average of $34.5 million on his six-year, $205 million deal from 2016 with the Diamondbacks.
Cole also is being pursued by the Angels and Dodgers, so that figure may just be a starting point. And if Cole's next contract soars to unprecedented heights, it will only boost the asking price of the next tier of free-agent starters, Dallas Keuchel, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Madison Bumgarner.
The Cubs and White Sox both are in need of starting pitching, and we'll see if they have the stomach to spend what's necessary to get a front-line starter. The Sox appear to be willing to finally bite the bullet, reportedly missing out on Wheeler despite offering more money than the Phillies. Carlos Rodon isn't expected back until after the All-Star break, and Michael Kopech may be handled with care after undergoing Tommy John surgery at the end of 2018.
"With Rodon on the (injured list) and Kopech coming off (surgery), we feel good about adding potentially two arms to the mix," general manager Rick Hahn said last month at the general managers meetings. "If there are too many quality starters, we'll deal with that when it arises."
There have never been too many quality starters in the Sox rotation under Hahn, so it would be a nice problem to have.
The Cubs, meanwhile, have starter-turned-reliever Tyler Chatwood under contract for another $13 million in 2020, which is well above the average salary for a middle reliever. He could be the in-house replacement for Hamels, though it's still a risky proposition. If Chatwood gets off to another bad start in the rotation, would he still be as useful after a demotion to the bullpen?
Their best bet would be to add another starter in a trade for one of their young stars, with Kris Bryant being the most logical choice based on his likelihood of opting for free agency after 2021 (assuming he loses his service-time grievance and isn't declared a free agent after this season). The Cubs couldn't afford to trade Bryant without getting a significant haul in return in what would be the most scrutinized trade of the Theo Epstein era.
Another touchy question facing the Cubs is what to expect from Lester in 2020, the final guaranteed year of a deal that already has paid off for the Cubs. Lester has a $25 million mutual option for 2021, which is guaranteed if he throws 200 innings in 2020. He finished with 171 1/3 innings in '19, giving up a league-worst 205 hits. Opposing hitters batted .322 off Lester in the second half. The Cubs hope it's a blip, not a trend.
Having old pal David Ross as his new manager could benefit Lester, but the left-hander turns 36 in January and will have to prove he's still the pitcher he was when he started this new era at the 2014 winter meetings.

Texto completo: The holidays are here, and for many parents, it's all about managing their kids' expectations. They think they need to give their kids the biggest presents, the most presents and the coolest presents. But trust me: Little Sally won't be scarred for life if she doesn't get a pony.
It's OK to want the best for your kids — we all do. But you should never put yourself in a financial bind to make their holiday dreams come true. That's not what Christmas is about. While other parents are shelling out hundreds or even thousands of dollars to give their kids the "perfect" Christmas, you can teach your little ones about contentment.
Contentment isn't a money issue, even though it has a huge impact on your child's future. It's a heart issue. Content people may not have the best of everything, but they make the best of everything. Without contentment, people often try to fill the void in their hearts by cramming it full of more and more stuff. As a parent, you've got to prepare your children to defend themselves against this threat.
There's lots of research out there showing children are aware of what they have in comparison to what others have at a super-young age. Marketers fight for their attention early on, and by default, they're fighting for your money.
Make sure your kids know the newness of stuff isn't what funds their happiness or their value. Their worth goes far beyond a robo-unicorn, name-brand clothes or the iPhone 73 that everyone else has.
If you have teens, let them know if they pursue material things they're going to be a hamster on a wheel for the rest of their lives. They'll keep going around and around, always thinking the next thing is the one that will make them happy. But, of course, it won't. They'll just run in circles, wasting all their time and energy, and ultimately going nowhere. What God has in store for them is so much bigger than that.
One last reminder: Contentment isn't about age. It's about maturity. I've met 8-year-olds who get this, and 48-year-olds who don't. Your child can probably tell where your heart is regarding material wants and desires. So, be sure to give yourself a heart-check and show your child what real happiness, joy and contentment look like.
If you or your kids are struggling with contentment this season, I have a whole episode of "The Rachel Cruze Show" with advice on how to have more gratitude over the holidays. Remember, more is caught than taught. When your kids see you acting out of gratitude, it can have a huge impact on how they view things, too!

Attack is called 'act of terror'

Texto completo: PENSACOLA, Fla. – A Saudi pilot's deadly shooting rampage in a naval air station classroom here is being investigated as an act of terrorism, authorities said Sunday.
"We work, as we do with most active shooter investigations, with the presumption that this was an act of terrorism," Rachel Rojas, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news conference. But she added that the "investigation has not led us to any information that indicated any credible threat to our community."
Rojas said investigators were still trying to determine a motive for Friday's attack that killed three service members and injured eight. The gunman, a second lieutenant in the Royal Saudi Air Force and student naval flight officer at the Naval Aviation Schools Command who was armed with a legally purchased 9mm Glock handgun and several extra magazines, was shot to death by Escambia County sheriff's deputies.
Rojas said that the attacker was the sole shooter and that no arrests have been made in the case.
Investigators were interviewing the gunman's friends and colleagues, trying to determine whether he acted alone or was part of a network, she said. They also want to "discern if any possible ideology" prompted the attack, Rojas said.
She declined to comment on reports that investigators were trying to determine why the suspect and three other students visited tourist sites in New York City days before the attack. She also would not confirm reports by multiple news outlets citing authorities briefed on the investigation that the attacker hosted a dinner party days before the carnage at which guests viewed videos of mass shootings.
Authorities were tracking a trip the gunman made to New York with other students recently, a person familiar with the matter said.
Based on interviews with those who made the trip, the person said, there is no indication the travel was linked to anything sinister.
The trip lasted about four days. "They did touristy things," said the person, who is not authorized to speak publicly. It was after the group returned to Florida, the person said, that the shooter and others at a dinner gathering watched videos related to mass shootings.
The FBI identified the shooter as Mohammed Alshamrani, 21.
The Associated Press, the first media outlet to report on the party, said one of the three students who attended later recorded video outside the building while the shooting was taking place. Two other Saudi students watched from a car, AP said, citing a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity after being briefed by federal authorities.
The New York Times, citing a person briefed on the investigation, said the student who recorded the video told investigators he just happened to be in the area when the shooting broke out. The FBI said in a statement that it had obtained video taken a bystander from outside the building after the attack had begun and after first responders had arrived.
The Navy identified the victims as Airman Mohammed Hathaim, 19, of St.Petersburg, Florida; Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson, 23, of Coffee, Alabama; and Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott Walters, 21, of Richmond Hill, Georgia.
The murders in Florida come at an already tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations after the Saudi role in the 2018 slaying of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post journalist. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saudi Arabia's foreign minister "expressed his condolences and sadness" for the attack.
Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, said he spoke with Saudi Ambassador Reema Al-Saud, expressing "in the strongest possible terms" that the U.S. expected full Saudi cooperation. "This was a planned terrorist attack, and the shooter wasn't alone," Gaetz said.
Alshamrani was one of 852 Saudi nationals in the U.S. training under a cooperation agreement. He was among 5,180 foreign students from 153 countries in the United States for military training. Many of those students operate military hardware foreign governments buy from the United States.
Acting Defense Secretary Mark Esper said he had ordered a review of the Defense Department's security and vetting policies.
Hours before the shooting, tweets purportedly written by the suspect railed against the United States for its support of Israel and for stationing troops at bases in Saudi Arabia. Rojas declined to confirm that tweets came from the Saudi military trainee.
Rita Katz, director of the U.S.-based SITE intelligence group that tracks jihadist activity, said the now-deleted Twitter account was created in 2012 and amassed more than 2,700 tweets.

The weak case for impeachment and why it might backfire

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library. A sign next to the letter reads, “Despite the State Department’s many attempts to change it, the President finally demanded that his own personal draft be sent to Brezhnev accompanied by the State Department’s thoughts in a separate document.”
Imagine the news headlines that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff’s leaky crew could have made from that.
They certainly puffed up the importance of government workers who were never elected by anybody. “NSC staff had prepared a standard package of talking points for the President based on official U.S. policy,” the Intelligence Committee report states in a section titled, “The President’s Misconduct.” The talking points “included recommendations to encourage President Zelensky to continue to promote anti-corruption reforms in Ukraine,” which was “a pillar of American foreign policy in the country” going all the way back to “the 1990s” but — cue the dramatic music — “this call would deviate significantly from that script.”
Of course, the president has a perfect right to deviate from the staff’s script and to make changes in the policy, but House Democrats, most of them, contend that Trump was motivated by the desire for personal political advantage.
Here’s what Trump said to the president of Ukraine: “I would like you to do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike … I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. As you saw yesterday, that whole nonsense ended with a very poor performance by a man named Robert Mueller, an incompetent performance, but they say a lot of it started with Ukraine. Whatever you can do, it’s very important that you do it if that’s possible.”
And also, “I would like [Rudy Giuliani] to call you. I will ask him to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what’s happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.”
And also, “The other thing, there’s a lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.”
In all three of those excerpts, Trump is asking Zelensky to work with the attorney general of the United States, William Barr. The AG is heading up an investigation into the suspicious origins of the Trump-Russia story that was used to justify a secret counter-intelligence investigation, then a secret warrant to spy on an American who was an adviser to the Trump campaign and then a two-year investigation by a special prosecutor that ultimately found nothing that linked Trump to Russia.
Barr’s investigation follows a narrower investigation by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz. The IG has jurisdiction to investigate current employees of the government, but lacks wider authority. Still, Horowitz’s report is expected to shed light on the actions of FBI employees and others who made questionable decisions to investigate Trump during the 2016 campaign.
The report is set for release on Monday, Dec. 9.
Is it possible that the Democrats’ noisy rush to impeachment is a massive misdirection to neutralize the damage from coming reports about the actions of officials during the Obama administration?
We’ll see. Meanwhile, the signs of political damage are beginning to appear.
On Thursday evening, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a one-hour televised town-hall meeting on CNN. Thirty-four minutes in, she was pleading with the audience, “Could we not have any more questions about impeachment?”
By November, that may be the Democrats’ campaign slogan.

Texto completo: It was Gerald R. Ford who said, “an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.”
Ford said that in 1970, and he wasn’t talking about President Richard Nixon. He was proposing the impeachment of a Supreme Court justice.
Then-Congressman Ford, the House Republican leader, “touched off an angry floor debate,” according to a New York Times report, “by suggesting that Justice William O. Douglas might have had ties with gambling and underworld figures.” Ford said the 71-year-old justice was “unfit and should be removed.” He accused Douglas of espousing “hippie-yippie style revolution” in his writings.
The House Judiciary Committee investigated for six months, but there never was a trial in the Senate. Justice Douglas served on the Court until his retirement in 1975. Then it was Gerald R. Ford who appointed his successor, having become president in 1974 when Nixon resigned under threat of impeachment.
Although it may seem that impeachment is a rare occurrence, the subject comes up often in American political history.
“The Framers foresaw that impeachment might be subject to superheated partisanship,” wrote Harvard Law School professor Raoul Berger in his 1973 book, “Impeachment: The Constitutional Problems.” Berger noted that the impeachment of President Harry Truman was suggested during the Korean War, there were repeated demands for Nixon’s impeachment over the war in Vietnam and John F. Kennedy believed that “if he had not moved to expel Soviet nuclear missiles from Cuba at the time of the confrontation with Khrushchev, he ‘would have been impeached.’”
Dive into the scholarly research or take Jerry Ford’s word for it: An impeachable offense is whatever the House says it is, and conviction is whatever two-thirds of the Senate “considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office.”
The House of Representatives can impeach President Donald Trump, even if he didn’t commit any crime. Impeachment trials are nothing like criminal trials. After an impeachment trial, the prosecutors and the jury have to stand trial themselves—in their next election.
One-third of the United States Senate and every member of the House of Representatives will be on the ballot in November 2020, unless they’ve chosen not to run for re-election or somebody knocks them out in a primary.
Impeachment is politically risky, yet House Democrats are pursuing it at the frantic pace of a Keystone Kops chase. The Intelligence Committee’s 300-page impeachment report is a rush job that draws heavily on the opinions and impressions of bureaucratic specialists who clearly are appalled that the president isn’t relying on their advice.
This type of conflict between bureaucratic experts and elected leaders isn’t new. In the early 1980s, President Ronald Reagan sent a handwritten letter to Soviet General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, which is on display at the Reagan Library.

More fallout from ‘Mount Tariff’

Texto completo: No major American daily newspaper features sharper, more poisonous pens than the market-focused writers at The Wall Street Journal. When these opinion peddlers go after you in print, they hit hard, fast, and  most of the time  with inarguable fact.
Witness the Journals lead editorial Dec. 3, titled Mount Tariff Erupts Again, a full-frontal assault on President Donald J. Trumps day-before tweets in which he imposed new steel tariffs on two of American agricultures biggest export competitors  and now Chinas growing ag suppliers  Brazil and Argentina.
Its hard to know exactly what motivated Mr. Trumps tweets, wondered the editorialists,  but he seems to think he can use tariffs as a two-fer to help struggling U.S. steel makers while punishing Argentina and Brazil for displacing U.S. farm exports to China.
Thats not how markets  or even White Houses  work, the Journal reminded readers. In fact, Hes wrong on every count.
That unmistakable poke arrived just as the president was, yet again, repositioning his ever-shifting position on a much-awaited U.S.-China trade deal. Well, Mr. Trump opined from Europe, In some ways I like the idea of waiting until after the election for the China deal.
Yes, that election, Nov. 3, 2020, a full growing season from now.
So where does all this presidential tweaking, tweeting, and, according to the Journal, twaddle, leave U.S. farmers and ranchers, Chinese buyers, and the U.S. economy?
One unlikely comparison captures the essence of the presidents tariff policy and, as he calls it, the fake news media, especially his hometown newspaper, The New York Times.
First, predictably, U.S. steel tariffs have hit U.S. steelmakers harder than foreign steel exporters. As the Journal noted, U.S. steel prices have plunged by nearly half since June 2018 and (p)rimary metal manufacturing jobs have fallen by 7,900 since [this] January
These facts are confirmed in the stock price of U.S. Steel, the nations second largest steel maker. After more than a year of market-guarding tariffs, U.S. Steel shares now hover at $13, up from its 2019 low of $10.14 in mid-October but still 30 percent below its Jan. 2 price of $18.51.
Clearly, protective steel tariffs have bloodied, not boosted, the American steel sector.
As such, why impose the same, wrong-headed policies now on Argentina  a nation that, according the Journal, makes up less than 1% of U.S. steel imports  and Brazil, a key ag export competitor?
That wrongness will be amplified by the presidents wait-until-the-election plan on any China trade deal. Indeed, in less than 24 hours the White House somehow found the best worst way to ensure that China, Argentina, and Brazil become even better trading buddies next year while U.S. farmers and ranchers see more of their markets simply handed over to competitors.
And thats if Mount Tariff doesnt blow again. If it does, the Chinese-Argentine-Brazilian ag trade triangle could become even more set in concrete.
But dont take it from me; take it from the nations leading business newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, the flagship of Rupert Murdochs American media empire that includes Fox News.
Oh, I nearly forgot, the aforementioned fake news comparison: As the U.S. steel industry was losing jobs, markets, and value under the tariff regime imposed by the president, one of his toughest media critics, the fake news New York Times, was killing it in the market.
On Jan. 2, 2019, the Times share price was $21.85; its year-to-date high, $35.68 per share, was hit on July 31. Its Dec. 3 price was $31.29, up  so far  in 2019 a whopping 43 percent.
That, too, is an irrefutable market reality.

Texto completo: I have the good fortune of delivering keynote speeches at over 100 corporate events per year. They range from a few hundred to many thousands of people in attendance, often with elaborate staging, lights, and production value.
Hours before taking the stage, an AV tech check occurs where all audio and visual elements are plugged in and tested.
Within 11 seconds of arrival, I can tell if it will be smooth sailing or a disaster (there's no middle ground here, by the way. It's either terrific or terrible).
I've discovered an inverse correlation between the number of times I'm called "dude" or "bro" and the quality of the crew.
In other words, if I'm greeted with a giant "DUUUUUDE!" I know I'm in trouble. "Hey bro, I'm still looking for a missing cable. Hope I can find it soon, dude."
AV tech: "Dude, your mac must be broken!"
Me: "Did you try un-muting your soundboard?"
AV tech (grinning): "Duuuude! All set, bro! Thanks dude."
On the other hand, you can instantly tell when a true professional is running the show. They are friendly, to be sure, but they also exude a knowing confidence. I can tell immediately when I'm in good hands, in the presence of a proficient expert. No worries on my end, no "dude" or "bro" coming from their lips.
There's a powerful lesson in here that transcends the world of corporate keynotes. We must ask ourselves ... how do we show up for those we serve? Do we project the sloppy dude-bro vibe of a careless amateur, or do we portray the grounded confidence of an expert? You can be sure that clients, team members and business partners alike take notice.
There's nothing wrong with being laid back or casual, but if we hope to win in these increasingly challenging times, we must be very deliberate about how we show up. Going far beyond first impressions, let's commit to demonstrate professionalism, expertise and mastery on a consistent basis.
I don't get to choose my AV crew, but your customers and employees make a choice every day. If we intend to keep — and grow — our most important relationships, let's put some energy into showing up like we're meant to be there. It may take a little extra attention to detail and focus, but the long-term rewards will be well worth the trouble.
Dude ... you'll really see the difference, bro.

Texto completo: One word was used to epitomize the entire 20th century.
Was it "progress," to mark the march of civilization from buggies to astronauts and the iPhone?
Maybe "upheaval," to delineate genocides and civic unrest?
No.
Try "jazz," to describe not only music, but the sweep and swing of the quintessential American century, and the cultural flows that invigorated it.
Who gets to decide such weighty, wordy things? The little-known American Dialect Society, or ADS, founded in 1889 and dedicated to the study of the English language in North America.
ADS has been picking a word of the year since 1990, longer than any other entity. Its members selected "jazz" from dozens of possible words in January 2000.
Now fast forward to the first week of 2020, when 300 to 400 of the society's language scholars are expected to meet in New Orleans to determine the word of 2019, as well as the even more consequential word of the decade that ends on New Year's Eve. The word of the previous decade, by the way, was "google," meaning "to search the internet."
Words of the year chosen by the ADS are not necessarily new words; they could be old ones used in new ways, said Marianna Di Paolo, emeritus linguistics professor and ADS member from the University of Utah. One example is "occupy," connected to the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protest against inequality.
During the last decade, the words of each year have bubbled out of the high-boiling soup of turbulent and tech-conscious times:
"App" in 2010. "Occupy" in 2011. "Hashtag" in 2012. "Because X" (a modern construction illustrated by the example, "Why would men wear capes? Because fashion") in 2013.
"#BlackLivesMatter" in 2014. "They" as a singular pronoun in 2015. "Dumpster fire" (describing election-related "public discourse and preoccupations") in 2016. "Fake news" in 2017. Last year, "tender-age shelter" (a euphemism referencing the facilities in which some immigrant children were separated from their parents). It beat out "the wall" (at the southern border).
The word of the decade won't necessarily be one of the yearly winners, said Ben Zimmer, the internationally known linguist and language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, who once penned the "On Language" column for The New York Times Magazine. The ADS draws up lists of candidates that may not become words of the year, but might still have a shot at being the 2010-19 representative.
There are "most likely to succeed" words, thought to have legs beyond any single year, such as "ghost," a verb from 2015 meaning to abruptly end a relationship by cutting off communication, especially online.Asked what he thinks the word of the decade will be, Zimmer was initially noncommittal.
"I wouldn't be surprised if 'they' as a singular pronoun does very well," he said. "It was word of the year in 2015 and has only grown since then, transcending 'he' and 'she' to represent nonbinary gender identity."

Where the Frauds Are All Legal

Texto completo: Welcome to the weird world of medical billing.
Much of what we accept as legal in medical billing would be regarded as fraud in any other sector.
I have been circling around this conclusion for this past five years, as I've listened to patients' stories while covering health care as a journalist and author. Now, after a summer of firsthand experience -- my husband was in a bike crash in July -- it's time to call out this fact head-on. Many of the Democratic candidates are talking about practical fixes for our high-priced health care system, and some legislated or regulated solutions to the maddening world of medical billing would be welcome.
My husband, Andrej, flew over his bicycle's handlebars when he hit a pothole at high speed on a Sunday ride in Washington. He was unconscious and lying on the pavement when I caught up with him minutes later. The result: six broken ribs, a collapsed lung, a broken finger, a broken collarbone and a broken shoulder blade.
The treatment he got via paramedics and in the emergency room and intensive care unit were great. The troubles began, as I knew they would, when the bills started arriving.
I will not even complain here about some of the crazy high charges: $ 182 for a basic blood test, $ 9,289 for two days in a room in intensive care, $ 20 for a pill that costs pennies at a pharmacy. We have great insurance, which negotiates these rates down. And at least Andrej got and benefited from those services.
What I'm talking about here were the bills for things that simply didn't happen, or only kind-of, sort-of happened, or were mislabeled as things they were not, or were so nebulously defined that I couldn't figure out what we might be paying for.
To be clear, many of the charges that I would call fraudulent -- maybe all of them -- are technically legal (thanks sometimes to lobbying by providers), but that doesn't make them right. And no one would accept them if they appeared on bills delivered by a contractor, or a lawyer or an auto mechanic. There were so many of these charges that I came up with categories to keep track of them:
1. Medical Swag
In the trauma bay, someone slapped a hard brace around Andrej's neck until scans confirmed that he had not suffered a grievous spinal injury. It was removed within an hour.
The medical equipment company that provided that piece of plastic billed $ 319. Our insurer paid $ 215 (90 percent of its discounted rate of $ 239). We were billed $ 24, our "patient responsibility."
Companies are permitted by insurers to bill for "durable medical equipment," stuff you receive for home use when you're in the hospital or doctors' office. That yields some familiar marked-up charges, like the sling you can buy at Walgreens for $ 15 but for which you or your insurer get a bill for $ 120 after it is given to you at urgent care. The policy has also led to widespread abuse, with patients sent home with equipment they don't need: My mom's apartment, for example, holds an unused wheelchair, a walker and a commode paid for by Medicare, by which I mean our tax dollars. It's as if you were given a swag bag at a conference and then sent a bill for hundreds or thousands of dollars.
At least with swag, you get to keep it. My husband's hardly worn neck brace didn't even come home with us as a souvenir.
2. The Cover Charge
The biggest single item on Andrej's E.R. bill was a $ 7,143.99 trauma activation fee. What was that for, since every component of his care had been billed and billed handsomely?
Among the line items: $ 3,400 for a high-level E.R. visit. $ 1,030 for the trauma surgeon. Between $ 1,400 and $ 3,300 for five purported CT scans. And I say "purported" because one trip into a scanner examined the head, upper spine and maxillofacial bones, but was billed as three separate things. There was also an administration fee of more than $ 350 each for four injections.
Trauma activation fees have been allowed since 2002, after 9/11, when the Trauma Center Association of America, an industry group, convinced regulators that they needed to be compensated for maintaining a state of "readiness."
Wait. Isn't the purpose of an E.R. to be "ready"? Isn't that why the doctors' services and scans are billed at higher rates when they are performed in an emergency department?
Despite scrutiny from researchers about whether trauma fees are deserved, trauma activation fees have only grown in size, 15 percent annually in recent years, and can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars. (On average, Medicare pays a fee of about $ 1,000.) Some have likened trauma activation fees to a cover charge for being wheeled into an E.R. with major trauma. But does a cover charge typically cost more than the meal?
3. Impostor Billing
We received bills from doctors my husband never met. Some of these bills were understandable, like for the radiologist who read the scans. But others were for bedside treatment from people who never came anywhere near the bed to deliver the care.
Andrej had a small finger fracture with a cut that needed some stitches, which a resident, a surgeon-in-training, sutured. But the $ 1,512 billed came in the name of a senior surgeon, as if he had done the work.
Physicians and many other health professionals are allowed to bill for the work of "extenders" -- stand-ins with less training who see patients and work under the supervising doctor. These might be residents, physician assistants or nurse anesthetists, for example. For billing purposes, this allows the senior providers to be in two, three, sometimes more than half a dozen places at once, often even when they are physically miles away.
The resident did a fine job on my husband. But if an assistant did the work, shouldn't it be billed for less? At law firms, the hourly rates for paralegals and junior attorneys are lower than those for partners.
On a website called Clinical Advisor, a reimbursement expert himself seemed to wonder at the profession's luck that such billing is tolerated: "I hear people ask, 'How can I do that? The doctor never saw the patient, never had any interaction with the patient and yet I can still bill this service under the physician?"'
4. The Drive-By
The day before Andrej left the hospital, a physical therapist visited and asked a few questions. From that brief encounter, the therapist noted "ambulation deficits, balance deficits, endurance deficits, pain-limiting function, transfer deficits." That translated into a bill of $ 646.15 for what was recorded as a P.T. evaluation "1st session only (billable)." He said he was there for 30 minutes, but he was not. He said he walked Andrej up 10 steps with a stabilizing belt for assistance. He did not. There was no significant health service given. Just an appearance and some boxes checked on a form. It's a phenomenon called drive-by doctoring.
More shockingly, the drive-bys continued at our home, presaged by a call on Andrej's cellphone a day after he was discharged. A physical therapist from a private company wanted to visit him for at-home therapy. In his discharge instructions, no one had mentioned this service, and his injury was clearly too fresh to benefit. She came. She didn't know which body part had been injured and concluded he was in too much pain to participate.
The same company called twice more the following week to schedule visits. By the third time, I told Andrej not to open the front door. Nonetheless, our insurer was billed -- and paid -- for three visits.
It's as if Alexa noticed that my dishwasher makes too much noise (it does) and took it upon herself to send over a repair guy. But if I turned him away at the front door, saying I'm O.K. with the racket (I am), would I still be billed for the visit?
5. The Enforced Upgrade
One Monday when Andrej was in pain and out of pills, the trauma doctor suggested we meet in the emergency room, because the trauma clinic was open only from 8 to 10:45 a.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays.
So we met the trauma doctors in the E.R., and they talked to Andrej, who remained in his street clothes. They gave him a prescription. Because the interaction -- which could have happened in the lobby -- happened in the E.R., it resulted in an E.R. visit charge of $ 1,330. But when the trauma clinic is open less than six hours a week, billing for an E.R. visit that doesn't tap into any of the emergency room resources feels like a scam. Is an E.R. visit determined by the content of the services rendered, or merely by the location?
Andrej had a similar experience when his broken finger was treated with a plastic splint that folded over his fingertip. He complained because the upper layer pressed on the fracture. At a follow-up visit, someone took a pair of scissors and cut off the upper half of the splint and taped the lower half back in place. That translated into a $ 481 charge for "surgery," in addition to the $ 375 charge for the office visit and a $ 103 facility fee. Doesn't surgery, by definition, involve cutting into flesh or an animate object -- not a piece of plastic?
Sure, it sounds fancy to upgrade a meeting to an E.R. visit, or to call the tweaking of a splint "surgery," but if an airline overbooks my flight and puts me on another flight where the only seat available is in first class, it does not charge me for the more expensive ticket.
My insurer paid for most of these questionable charges, though at discounted rates. But even a discounted payment for something that never really happened or didn't need to happen or that we didn't agree to have happen is still, according to common sense, a fraud.
Why do insurers pay? Partly because insurers have no way to know whether you got a particular item or service. But also because it's not worth their time to investigate the millions of medical interactions they write checks for each day. Despite the advertised concern about your well-being, as one benefits manager enlightened me: They're "too big to care about you." Electronic records, which auto-fill billing boxes, have probably made things worse. For example, the birth of a baby boy may automatically prompt a bill for a circumcision; having day surgery may prompt a check for sedation.
So what is the appropriate payment for swag I didn't ask for, outrageous cover charges, stand-in doctors, drive-by visits and faux surgery? In some cases, zero; in others, far less than was paid. And yet, these are all everyday, normal experiences in today's health care system, and they may be perfectly legal. If we want to tame the costs in our $ 3 trillion health system, we've got to rein in this behavior, which is fraud by any other name.

Texto completo: This is what I tell young people who press me for advice.
Whenever I visit a university, students ask for Big Advice. I protest that I don't have great secrets for life and that my own path has been serendipitous, but they suspect me of holding out.
So as we approach the holidays -- a time for reflection and New Year's resolutions -- let me reveal everything. I hereby share with young people the Four Secrets of Success:
1. Take a class in economics and in statistics. I majored in political science and later studied law, but in retrospect I would have focused on economics. Likewise, if you have to choose, skip calculus and focus on statistics.
Education isn't about filling a bucket but about gaining a tool belt -- and economics and statistics offer terrific tools that for the rest of your life will help you analyze problems in more rigorous ways. I champion the humanities for the wisdom they offer, but I do believe that philosophers and playwrights should have present value and standard deviations in their citizen tool belts.
We might also have sounder policy if our leaders weren't economic illiterates. President Trump and congressional Republicans sold the 2017 tax cut on the absurd notion that it would pay for itself (instead, we're now running a $ 1 trillion deficit). And it's not just Republicans: Democrats have been embracing rent control, even though basic economics show that typical rent-control schemes make housing shortages worse by increasing demand without increasing supply.
2. Connect to a cause larger than yourself. The worst advice people give students is to spend the first third of their lives studying, the middle third making money, and the final third giving back. That would rob you for two-thirds of your life of meaning and fulfillment.
If you dropped dead of a heart attack at 50, you'd be gnashing your teeth for all eternity.
So find some cause that gives you a sense of purpose, ideally by actually connecting you to those less fortunate. This will also lend perspective when a mean professor gives you a bad grade.
3. Make out. The most important decision you will make is not the university you attend, nor your major, not even your first job. It's who you marry or settle down with.
The right partner provides crucial emotional support, is likely to parent your children and comforts you when life inevitably goes wrong. A key to a successful career is a great partner. Learning to manage a relationship may take practice, so get started and cuddle!
4. Escape your comfort zone. Your world will be much more globalized than ours, so your education is a failure if it exposes you only to people like yourself and doesn't prepare you to engage with other cultures.
A quick quiz question: If someone who speaks two languages is bilingual, and someone who speaks three languages is trilingual, what do you call someone who speaks no foreign language at all? Answer: An American.
So take a semester abroad. It's ridiculous to study Spanish in a classroom when you can absorb so much more in Mexico, Bolivia or Peru. (Items 3 and 4 can be combined for maximum language acquisition.)
I sometimes subject young linguists to a three-question test: In a given language, how do you say: A) door knob; B) clothes hanger; C) electrical outlet. The students who ace this test are those who have actually lived abroad.
So resist the temptation to join a herd of other American students in Australia, Britain or even Italy. Try Colombia or China, Senegal or Oman, India or Ghana.
Study abroad can be expensive, so consider work and volunteer opportunities at omprakash.org and idealist.org. They also offer ideas for a gap year between high school and college, as does GlobalCitizenYear.org.
You can also enter a different world right here in the United States by volunteering in a prison or tutoring disadvantaged children in your own town. Or if you're a coastal elite, perhaps by finding a temporary job in Trump country, and if you're already happily in Trump country, find work where progressives predominate. The important thing is to encounter different cultures.
All this leads to an announcement: It's time for my annual win-a-trip contest. In 2020 as in previous years, I'll be choosing a university student (undergraduate or graduate) to travel with me on an expense-paid reporting trip to cover global poverty, health and other issues. The winner will write for The New York Times.
I'm not sure where we'll go. Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo are each possibilities, as is Bangladesh. It's also possible we'll stay here in the United States and explore the domestic side of global poverty. You can find out more at nytimes.com/winatrip, and thanks in advance to the Center for Global Development for helping me pick a winner.
Apply soon. But if I'm not smart enough to choose you, then maybe you can escape your comfort zone on your own, either abroad or here in the United States. If you don't win my trip, win your own.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump will host a "Merry Christmas" rally at Kellogg Arena in Battle Creek later this month.
"Michigan is booming thanks to President Trump, and jobs are coming back to the state," Kayleigh McEnany, national press secretary for Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., said in a press release. "President Trump is delivering on his promises, and he looks forward to celebrating those successes with the great men and women of Michigan this Christmas season."
Chairman of the Calhoun County Republican Committee Jeannie Burchfield said the local Republican party was beyond thrilled" to have Trump visit.
"Calhoun County is Trump country, for sure..." she said. "This will be a fantastic way for us to show support for the president."
Burchfield said the news about the rally was particularly exciting after having Marc Lotter, director of strategic communications for the Trump campaign, speak at the committee's annual dinner on Tuesday and seeing Vice President Mike Pence in Portage on Wednesday.
"This has been a crazy, wonderful week," she said.
Calhoun County Commissioner Jake Smith, a Democrat, said he hoped other presidential candidates would make Battle Creek a campaign stop.
"The Cereal City is where it's at, and I hope the Democratic candidate will come on through, too," he said. "I'm glad Battle Creek is getting the attention."
Despite the Trump administration's claim that Michigan's economy is booming, job growth has slowed considerably since the state's rebound from the Great Recession and has been essentially flat this year, said Charles Ballard, a Michigan State University economics professor and an expert on the state's economy.
That's true for the Upper Midwest, as a whole, according to the latest federal data, he said.
"It doesn't sound to me that our economy is booming," Ballard said. "I don't think we're in a recession, but we're kind of on the edge of a recession. The number of jobs is still well below what it was at its peak in 2000."
Trump won Michigan by 10,704 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the 4.8 million votes cast, but recent Sienna College / New York Times Upshot polls show him trailing Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders here in head-to-head matchups but ahead of Elizabeth Warren.
Trump has visited Michigan several times since the 2016 election, including a rally in December, 2016 in Walker and a visit to the American Center for Mobility at Willow Run in Ypsilanti in March of 2017. His last visit to the state was April 2018, when he held a rally in Macomb County's Washington Township.
The rally will be held at 7 p.m. on Dec. 18. Tickets are available online at www.donaldjtrump.com/events/ battle-creek-mi-dec-christmas-rally. They will be given out on a first-come, first served basis and are limited to two per mobile phone number.

Texto completo: Former Major League Baseball star Jimmy Rollins has sold his home in Encino to Grammy-winning producer-songwriter Philip Lawrence for $10.55 million in a deal completed off market.
The gated neoclassical-vibe house, built in 2017, has 14,900 square feet of polished living space, a gym, a home theater and indoor and outdoor swimming pools.
Two curving staircases bookend the entry, which sits under a gigantic dome skylight.

The two-story floor plan includes formal living and dining rooms, an office, a wine cellar, eight bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. Bi-folding doors in the open-plan kitchen and family room open to a patio for indoor-outdoor living. There's also a sauna.
Outside, grounds of more than half an acre contain a sports court, a cabana/kitchen, lawn and landscaping.
A detached guesthouse with a second kitchen sits across from the pool.
Rollins, who played for the Phillies, Dodgers and White Sox, bought the property about two years ago for $10.65 million, at the time a neighborhood record.
Earlier this year, he bought another home in Encino for $8.7 million.
The 40-year-old Rollins won four Gold Glove Awards at shortstop and was the 2007 National League most valuable player. The three-time all-star spent the majority of his 17-season career with Philadelphia and won a World Series title with the team in 2007.
Lawrence, 40, has won eight Grammys including one for album of the year in 2016 for his work on Bruno Mars' "24K Magic." Adele, Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa are among other artists Lawrence has worked with as a producer or songwriter.
Marc Noah of Sotheby's International Realty and Dennis Chernov of Keller Williams Realty were the listing agents.

Good morning, Tiburon
The Bay Area estate of late actor and comedian Robin Williams has come up for sale at $7.25 million.
Located in Paradise Cay, an enclave that hugs the Tiburon peninsula, the single-story Mediterranean residence sits on a double lot abutting San Francisco Bay.
The roughly 6,500-square-foot house, built in 1987, has six bedrooms, 6.5 bathrooms, a wood-paneled library/den and an office. Walls of windows in the living room and kitchen look out toward the bay.
A swimming pool with a spa and stone patios fill out the grounds.
Williams, who graduated from Redwood High School in Marin County, bought the property through a trust in 2008 for $4.05 million. After his death in 2014 at age 63, the property was transferred to a trust tied to his widow, Susan Williams.
Among the world's most successful entertainers of his time, the comic rose to fame in the late 1970s with his starring role on the sitcom "Mork & Mindy," a spinoff of the popular "Happy Days." As a film actor, Williams is remembered for prominent roles in "Good Morning, Vietnam" (1987) and "Dead Poets Society" (1989). He won an Oscar for his supporting role in "Good Will Hunting" (1997).
Compass' Wright-Mulligan Team holds the listing.

A new keep for 'The Purge' actress
Actress Paola Nunez, known for her roles in Mexican telenovelas and TV series "The Purge," must have liked what she saw in this Hollywood Hills home. She recently paid $1.349 million -- or $100,000 over the asking price -- for a scenic property in Laurel Canyon.
Designed for loft-style living, the split-level pad makes good use of its space. Rolling ladders ascend to a bookcase and lounge, and a lofted living room overlooks the skylighted floor plan below.
Lumber pops up plenty in the common spaces, where intersecting beams hang over hardwood floors. Wood covers the cabinetry and breakfast bar in the kitchen, which extends to a dining room under tall ceilings.
Within 1,500 square feet of space are two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Vaulted ceilings and a fireplace accent the master suite, which opens outside to one of two spacious patios. A rooftop deck with sweeping canyon views completes the scene.
Marissa Faith of Deasy Penner Podley held the listing. Jason Paukovits of Dream Realty Asset Management represented the buyer.
Nunez, 41, had leading roles in "Las Juanas," "Amor en custodia," "Pasion morena" and "Reina de corazones" in the 2000s before more recent roles in the English-language shows "The Son" and "The Purge," which is currently airing its second season on USA Network.

Novelist's estate to start a new chapter
The longtime Bel-Air home of late romance novelist Judith Krantz has come up for sale as a pocket listing for $10.5 million.
The Italianate-vibe house, dating to the 1930s, sits on a gated lot of more than half an acre that abuts the Bel-Air Country Club. Views from the site, which is surrounded by hedges and mature trees, take in the greens and fairways as well as the surrounding canyons.
The 6,657-square-foot residence features grand common areas including a living room with a fireplace and a garden-view breakfast room. A two-story library with walls of built-ins sits off the rotunda entry. There's also an elevator.
Set beneath vaulted ceilings, the master suite has dual bathrooms, walk-in closets, a fireplace and a terrace. There are six bedrooms and six bathrooms in all.
Outside, box hedges frame stone pathways and formal gardens. The grounds also have a swimming pool, a detached guesthouse, lawn and landscaping. At the far end of the property, a private gate provides direct access to the Bel-Air Country Club's driving range.
Krantz, who died in June at age 91, had owned the property since 1986.
The author was born in New York City and worked in Paris and New York as a fashion publicist before beginning her career as a magazine journalist for Good Housekeeping. Her first two novels were the New York Times bestsellers "Scruples" and "Princess Daisy," the latter of which set the record at the time for the highest price ever paid for a novel. Many of her books have been adapted as TV miniseries including "Secrets" and "Torch Song."
Stefan Pommepuy, Jonathan Ruiz and Mauricio Umansky of the Agency hold the listing.

Quick sale for comedy legend
A coastal New York cottage once owned by comedy icon Mel Brooks and his late wife, actress Anne Bancroft, has sold roughly two months after hitting the market.
Set on a waterfront lot in Southhampton Village, one of the largest summer colonies in the Hamptons, the 1960s house came up for sale in September and sold for the full asking price of $4.995 million.
Past a wood-shingled exterior, the two-story opens to renovated living spaces overlooking Shinnecock Bay. The floor plan fits four bedrooms and 3.5 bathrooms into 2,400 square feet. Walls of glass line the living and dining rooms, and the kitchen adds stainless-steel appliances and splashes of marble.
Upstairs, a brick fireplace anchors the master suite. The bedroom overlooks the bay, as does the spa tub in the bathroom.
A grassy landscaped yard sits off the front, while rear decking spans the length of the home. The grounds encompass about 1.33 acres.
Michaela Keszler of Douglas Elliman held the listing. Mary Quatroche of Morley Agency represented the buyer.
Mel Brooks, 93, starred in "Blazing Saddles," "Young Frankenstein," "Spaceballs" and "The Producers," for which he won an Oscar. A musical adaptation of the film ran on Broadway from 2001 to 2007.
He's one of 15 people to win Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards, a feat otherwise known as an EGOT.
Bancroft, who died in 2005 at age 73, is remembered for her roles in "The Graduate," "The Miracle Worker" and "Agnes of God," among others. She won an Oscar for her lead role in 1962's "The Miracle Worker."

Texto completo: The president said Friday night on Twitter that he was temporarily putting off the designation at the request of the president of Mexico.
President Trump said Friday that he would temporarily hold off on designating Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, saying he was doing so at the request of the president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador.
"All necessary work has been completed to declare Mexican Cartels terrorist organizations," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. "Statutorily we are ready to do so."
However, at the request of Mr. López Obrador, "a man who I like and respect, and has worked so well with us," Mr. Trump wrote, he was temporarily holding off on the designation and stepping up "joint efforts to deal decisively with these vicious and ever-growing organizations!"
Mr. Trump did not make clear how long he was prepared to delay the designation or what precisely the Mexican president had requested.
President López Obrador, speaking at an event late Friday in his home state, Tabasco, applauded Mr. Trump's decision.
"I celebrate that he has taken our opinion into account," the Mexican president said. "There has to be cooperation with respect for our sovereignties, cooperation without interventionism. And I think it was a very good decision that he took today."
"We thank President Trump for respecting our decisions and for choosing to maintain a policy of good neighborliness, a policy of cooperation with us," Mr. López Obrador said. "He will always have, on our side, an open, frank, extended hand to continue moving forward together for the sake of our peoples and the good of our two nations."
Mr. Trump had said in an interview posted online on Nov. 26 that he was moving ahead with the designation, citing what he said was the high number of Americans killed by cartels.
The comments, which were made in an interview with the former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and posted to his personal website, represent a shift in United States policy that the Mexican foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, had told reporters a day earlier he did not believe would happen.
"I will be designating the cartels," Mr. Trump said in the interview. "I have been working on that for the last 90 days. You know, designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process."
Mr. Ebrard said on Twitter on Friday that he appreciated Mr. Trump's announcement, and predicted there would be good results.
Mr. Trump's comments came a day after Attorney General William P. Barr met in Mexico City with Mr. López Obrador and high-level officials from his administration. After his meeting with Mr. Barr, Mr. López Obrador described the encounter as "good."
"As a lawyer, he understands our constitution obligates us to adhere to the principles of cooperation for development and nonintervention in foreign affairs," the Mexican president said on Twitter, referring to Mr. Barr. "In this way we will always be able to work together."
Mexican officials revealed little about the bilateral meetings on Thursday.
A statement from the Mexican Foreign Ministry said the two sides had discussed "security priorities" for both nations and had talked about, among other issues, "cooperation in arms trafficking, money laundering, international drug flows and how to deal with transnational crime."
Deadly violence by drug cartels in Mexico gained new attention in the United States in recent weeks after the killings of six children and their three mothers, all dual Mexican and American citizens, who were part of a fundamentalist Mormon community in the north of the country.
After that ambush, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the time had come "for Mexico, with the help of the United States, to wage WAR on the drug cartels and wipe them off the face of the earth."

Texto completo: A reader praises the speaker for moving ahead with impeachment charges.
To the Editor:
Re "Pelosi Declares House Will Begin to Draw Up Impeachment Charges" (front page, Dec. 6):
Bravo, Nancy!
Our brave and eloquent speaker was correct when she said earlier that impeachment would be so divisive to the country. But President Trump was going to make the coming campaign ugly and divisive anyway. Eleven months is a long time in today's hurtling political world.
Like Ms. Pelosi, most of us don't hate Mr. Trump. We just want him out of office, because he is causing potentially irreparable harm to the body politic. I actually feel sorry for him, because he is clearly chronically insecure. How else to explain his own spewing of hatred?
We deserve better. By a substantial margin, we voted for better.
Daniel Stepner

Texto completo: Kamala Harris is out! This is big news. The Democratic presidential field is shrinking. We’ve got only 15 people left. Twenty-six fewer than the House Judiciary Committee. Smaller than the cast of “Saturday Night Live.” Although sometimes more entertaining.
It’s natural the field is crowded — there are approximately 47 million native-born Democrats of presidential age in this country, at least 46.9 million of whom think they’d do a better job than Donald Trump. And it is probably true that most of them could manage to get through a NATO meeting without being laughed at by our allies.
Although she was by far the most prominent defection, Harris was the 14th candidate to throw in the towel. Just before she made her announcement, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak dropped out. And how many of you called up a friend with that news? I’ll bet you don’t even know what Bullock and Sestak look like. Or which one walked all the way across New Hampshire to demonstrate his commitment to the race.
Not going to let you dangle in suspense. Sestak, a former Navy admiral, did the hiking. You have to feel sorry for the man. He tried really hard. (“The rain is pouring, and the wind is blowing, but I’m still walking across New Hampshire.”) And got zip.
It could have been a lot worse, Kamala. You didn’t have to walk 105 miles to get noticed. And you get to go back to being a U.S. senator, which is a very good job. Think about how you’d feel if you were Beto O’Rourke.
Harris, 55, was one of the few serious Democratic candidates who isn’t either exceptionally young or exceptionally old. Joe Biden, for instance, is 77 and currently demonstrating his youthful worldview by driving around in a bus called “No Malarkey.”
It’s definitely a new campaign strategy, flaunting the fact that you were a cool kid in the 1950s. What’s going to come next? Visiting all 99 Iowa counties in The Classy Chassis? Touring New Hampshire in the Cruisin’ For A Bruisin’ Express? Coming soon: a major Biden position paper titled “A Full Ice Box for Every American.”
Final Biden question of the day. When he suddenly nibbled his wife’s finger during a campaign event, did you think:
A) “Awww.”
B) “Ewwww.”
C) “Hey, that’s just what my grandfather did to my grandmother at their 60th anniversary party.”
Let’s just hope this doesn’t become a trend. I do not like the idea of Bernie Sanders taking a nip out of Jane’s thumb somewhere around Cedar Rapids.
Iowa does get all the excitement. And attention. Harris once sent out a fundraising email (probably) joking that she was going to move there. Back in 2007, former Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd actually did, enrolling his daughter in an Iowa public school. Iowans, who are used to being desperately pursued, weren’t impressed.
Harris was an attractive candidate except for the part about not being good at organization or coming up with a consistent theme. The only truly disturbing thing about her departure is that the field she’s leaving behind isn’t exactly diverse. This month’s debate may be all white. And Deval Patrick, the black former Massachusetts governor who just jumped into the race, isn’t setting the world on fire. One of his earliest events, at Morehouse College in Atlanta, got canceled when nobody came.
I’m sorry, “nobody came” is too sad. There were actually two people in the audience. Let’s hope Patrick at least took them out for a drink.
Harris blamed her campaign’s collapse on a lack of money. “I am not a billionaire,” she said in her farewell tweet. Everybody’s complaining about billionaires, but imagine if we were writing stories right now about all the candidates who were unemployed and running for president out of an aunt’s attic.
Really, there are just two billionaires. Tom Steyer is running as one who’s worried about “corporate money.” In a different world we might be cynical about a hedge fund titan who used to invest tons of money in fossil fuels campaigning as an environmentalist foe of big business. But hey, everybody makes mistakes.
Michael Bloomberg has been using his pin money to buy enough advertising time to sell everyone in America a taco or an exercise machine. But think about it from his point of view. Bloomberg is a very qualified candidate, except that his demeanor and all-purpose lovability would never raise enough campaign contributions to get him elected state legislator. He’s just filling in the gap.
The immediate question for Harris fans is whether she might get tapped for vice president. (Without being coldhearted, you have to admit that’s a pretty important prospect when the odds are so good the top slot will go to someone over 70.)
And what’s next for everybody else? Just a couple of things we know for sure. Big debate in two weeks. Meanwhile, 15 Democrats will make many favorable comments about Iowa. Several may consider acquiring a bus with a fun name. Donald Trump will say he’s forgotten more things, perhaps including Rudy Giuliani. The beat goes on.

Texto completo: NORFOLK - Right on time, the Virginia Stage Company has unveiled its traditional presentation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," showing how even the worst of misers can become a good Samaritan.
No "bah, humbugs!" allowed.
In 1993, The New York Times wrote that Dickens was inspired to write the story after a visit to a ragged school, which were common in nineteenth-century Britain.
These schools were often set up in working-class neighborhoods and dedicated to providing free education to poor children.
Dickens, who grew up in poverty himself, felt a connection to those children, which he described hiding in the robes of Christmas Present as "yellow, meager, ragged, scowling, wolfish; but prostrate too in their humility." He thought his now-historic tale might help to help lift them up.
"A Christmas Carol" is 176 years old, but the book has never gone out of print and Dickens' story is performed on thousands of stages across the world every year. The Virginia Stage Company has been performing the tale since 1996.
Nearly everyone knows the story: a cold-hearted curmudgeon, Ebenezer Scrooge, journeys through Christmas past, present and future.
By the end of his miraculous time travels and hard-learned lessons, Scrooge - who had just refused to help the needy and scolded his loyal employee for expecting a day off for Christmas - decides to turn his life around and use his wealth to do good.
The story still delivers all the holiday warm-and-fuzzies and, as Dickens hoped, inspires many to pay it forward.
Virginia Stage Company has been presenting this play for xx years. This year features a new director, Marianne Savell; a new Scrooge, Steven Minow; and a new character, Dickens himself, as narrator, played by John Forkner.
In the spirit of the season, we asked some of the cast members to share their Christmas traditions and fondest memories.
Adalee Alt, playing Tiny Tim
On Christmas Eve, my mom reads us "'Twas the night before Christmas." After that, we set out cookies and carrots for Santa and his reindeer.
Rhys West, playing Boy Scrooge
I have a lot of favorite holiday and winter traditions that I love. When it snows outside I love to go sledding, but not in Virginia Beach because there are no hills. I also love to make snow cream with my family. I love picking out our Christmas tree at the Christmas tree farms. One of my favorite things to do is to watch people's reactions when they get their gifts. Spending time with family and no homework is also a plus! My family and I love to listen to Christmas music and sing Christmas carols on the record player.
Steven Minow, playing Ebenezer Scrooge
I am from Sacramento, Calif. For a time we had a philanthropic group called Christmas Promise whose mission was to provide a magical Christmas Eve visit from Santa himself. Because I am an actor, my sister's mother-in-law who was very much involved with the group asked if I would be interested in playing one of the Santas. Because they would endeavor to bring Christmas to as many destitute families as possible, it required about 50 Santas. Each of us were assigned three to four families to visit, unannounced on the eve of the big day. We each had our own elves, drivers and beautifully wrapped packages of toys, clothing, and even brand new bicycles for the children. One especially heart-warming visit, I got to give a little boy a brand new skateboard. He ran outside immediately. When he came back inside I asked, "Peter, where'd you go?" He responded, "I went outside to see the reindeer!"
Tre'Veon Porchia, playing Dick Wilkins
Every year, my immediate family, my grandma, my aunt, and my uncle on my mom's side meet at my house. Before I turned 18, all of the kids were upstairs while everyone brought in the presents and we stayed upstairs until they told us we could come down. My grandma always brought humongous red stockings full of food and clothes and presents. My aunt and uncle always brought the most delicious cookies that they only make at Christmas time. My mom would make a breakfast casserole, lasagna, and mimosa (non-alcoholic, of course). After that, we take a few hours to enjoy our presents and hang out before going to my aunt's house to see the rest of the family. I've come to expect the same routine every year and I enjoy it.
Lynn Kenny Richards, playing Mrs. Cratchit
Our family celebrates the German tradition of St. Nick's Day on the morning of Dec. 6 with a stocking of goodies, opening an advent calendar each day of the month and presents under the tree on Christmas morning. We like to serve at our church as well as helping to collect food for local food pantries and toys for The Salvation Army.
Ryan Clemens, playing Jacob Marley
My fondest Christmas tradition has become performing in VSC's "A Christmas Carol." For the past eight seasons, I have been honored and blessed to be a part of this story. I've played Bob Cratchit, Fezziwig, the Charity Man, Old Joe and Marley, too! This production is one that is so meaningful to me, our company, our community, and countless children who've come to enjoy the magic and wonder of live theater. Each new year and each performance, there is a shared joy that brings every person in the Wells Theatre together with full hearts and lifted spirits.

Texto completo: "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" is back for a third season. And a long-lost adaptation of "Wuthering" starring Richard Burton has been recovered.
What's streaming
THE MARVELOUS MRS. MAISEL Stream on Amazon. Mrs. Midge Maisel is back for another season, but this time ... she's on tour. Accompanied by her sidekick/manager Susie (Alex Borstein), Midge -- played by Rachel Brosnahan -- accompanies a musician on his tour across the U.S. As she enjoys glamorous cities and navigates the challenges of life on the road, Midge's husband and parents are adjusting to the courses of their own lives. But one thing remains abundantly clear: Mrs. Maisel has no intention of slowing down. "This show is nothing but momentum," James Poniewozik wrote of the previous season in his New York Times review. "It jabbers, it twirls, its heels click across the room," he added. "It would love to stay and chat, but it's gotta get somewhere."
FULLER HOUSE Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. When D.J. Tanner-Fuller found herself newly widowed with three sons, her sister, Stephanie, and best friend, Kimmy, moved in to raise their families together; and so started this continuation of the hit series "Full House" (1987-95). Five seasons later, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) now has a baby, Kimmy (Andrea Barber) is raising her teenage daughter, and D.J. (Candace Cameron Bure) has a new love interest. It's a fuller house, for sure.
THE FAVOURITE (2018) Stream on HBO Now and HBO Go; rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Emma Stone, Rachel Weisz and Olivia Colman star in this unsettling, darkly comedic drama set in 18th-century Britain. Queen Anne (Colman) is neurotic, self-pitying and in failing health, yet is wildly spirited. She finds a lover and adviser in her lifelong friend Sarah Churchill (Weisz). But when Sarah's cousin Abigail Hill (Stone) appears at the palace looking for work, it isn't long before Abigail rivals Sarah, politically and romantically, for her position with the queen. Directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, the film "is a farce with teeth," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, "a costume drama with sharp political instincts and an aggressive sense of the absurd."
What's on TV
WUTHERING HEIGHTS (1958) 8 p.m. on TCM. A DuPont Show of the Month in 1958, James Costigan's adaptation of "Wuthering Heights" has not been seen since the single date it aired: 61 years ago. Daniel Petrie directed this rendition of Emily Brontë's novel, in which Heathcliff -- played by none other than Richard Burton -- falls in love with his stepsister Cathy, played by Rosemary Harris. When Cathy instead marries a wealthy man, Heathcliff enacts revenge. Costigan has been "widely praised" for this adaptation, Margalit Fox wrote in The Times.

Raeanne Rubenstein, 74, Celebrity Photographer Of Two Worlds, Is Dead

Texto completo: She had a knack for capturing her subjects, whether Andy Warhol in New York or Dolly Parton in Nashville, in ways that caught their essence.
Raeanne Rubenstein, whose distinctive photographs captured the stars and the energy of two seemingly disparate worlds -- the emerging art-and-rock scene in New York beginning in the late 1960s and, soon after that, the country music world of Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and others -- died on Saturday in Nashville. She was 74.
Her assistant, Stephen Kohl, said the cause was cardiac arrest.
Ms. Rubenstein photographed Andy Warhol, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Jimi Hendrix and countless others who were part of the high-voltage New York scene in the late 1960s and early '70s. Camping out at places like the Fillmore East, the storied rock venue on Second Avenue near East Sixth Street, she grabbed both backstage images and performance shots. Her work first appeared in publications like The East Village Other, an alternative newspaper, but before long it was turning up in Rolling Stone and mainstream magazines, including People and Life.
The author Holly George-Warren, who as editor of Rolling Stone Press used Ms. Rubenstein's photographs in "Trouble Girls: The Rolling Stone Book of Women in Rock" (1997) and in her own books, said Ms. Rubenstein's pictures stood out.
"Raeanne could zero in on an artist's essence and capture that with her camera," she said by email. "These usually guarded people opened up to her, and there's often a playful quality to her images."
The documentarian Ken Burns found Ms. Rubenstein's photographs of country music stars similarly compelling. He used them in his "Country Music" series, seen this year on PBS.
"She had a great ability to capture a moment," Mr. Burns said by email, "whether it was Dolly Parton on her tour bus or Janis Joplin onstage, and we were fortunate to meet her and have access to her files."
Ms. Rubenstein often said that the key to a good celebrity photograph was establishing trust, something she almost always managed to do.
"I've got a warm spot in my heart for everybody with the exception of one or two," she said of her many subjects in a 2000 interview with The Tennessean. "The ones that gave up the goods, I like the best."
She was born Rae Anne Rubenstein (she later merged the first two names) on Sept. 15, 1945, on Staten Island. Her father, Isidore, owned the Tudor Furniture Company, and her mother, Sylvia (Grossman) Rubenstein, taught elementary school.
After graduating from Curtis High School on Staten Island, Ms. Rubenstein attended the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, where her friends included Lita Eliscu. Upon graduating in 1967 Ms. Rubenstein went to London for a time, while Ms. Eliscu stayed stateside and became a journalist, often writing about celebrities. When Ms. Rubenstein returned to the United States in the late 1960s, taking up residence in the East Village, the two reconnected, and Ms. Rubenstein had her entree.
"I would go along and take pictures of the people she interviewed, and then the magazines inevitably would need art to go with their story," Ms. Rubenstein recalled in a brief oral history recorded for a website dedicated to The East Village Other, for which both women worked.
"I met Andy Warhol when I was her tag-along," she said, and she photographed him numerous times over the next decade, her pictures appearing in various publications. "In a way," she added, "I became the go-to person for Andy in the straight-journalism world because he would always say yes to me."
She immersed herself in the New York music and arts scene, mixing portraiture, posed composition and action photography.
"Her ability to get in close with her subjects and to move through very unusual and different circles is part of the reason we have such a good photographic record of the counterculture of the 1960s," Claudia Dreifus, another East Village Other alumna and now the writer of the "A Conversation With" feature in The New York Times, said by email. "She was there always -- very much on the scene, and yet she still kept a wry distance."
Ms. Rubenstein photographed numerous rock stars, but soon, again accompanying Ms. Eliscu on an assignment, she had her first exposure to a different type of music: that being played in Nashville. Johnny Cash, who from 1969 to 1971 starred in a television variety show filmed at Ryman Auditorium, then home of the Grand Ole Opry, was the article's subject. She often told the story of finding herself in an empty Ryman, a fish out of water taking in the strange new world, biding her time while Ms. Eliscu went to look for Cash.
"I didn't know anybody there," she says in "Country: Portraits of an American Sound" (2015), a documentary by Steven Kochones about the photographers who helped shape country music's image, "so I was sitting there waiting, and all of a sudden there was this tap on my shoulder, and I looked up and, oh my God, it was Johnny Cash. And he said, 'Hello little lady; can I help you?"'
Marty Stuart played in Cash's backing band before becoming a country star himself. In the documentary, he credits Ms. Rubenstein with helping to bring the genre increased prominence by virtue of her stature as a rock photographer.
"Raeanne coming in the early '70s, when country music was struggling to find its way into the mainstream, and then taking it back to her world was almost like having a correspondent," Mr. Stuart says. "It gave country music a voice."
Ms. Rubenstein went on to photograph decades' worth of country stars. Among the series of photography books she published were "Honky-Tonk Heroes: A Photo Album of Country Music" (1975) and "Gone Country: Portraits of Country Music's New Stars" (1997). In 1998 she moved to Nashville permanently, founding an online entertainment and style magazine called Dish.
Although singers and bands got a lot of her attention over the years, her photographic subjects stretched beyond the music world to include figures as different as Rodney Dangerfield and Muhammad Ali. In a video interview with the syndicated show "World of Photography," she talked about the difficulties of photographing busy and sometimes fickle celebrities.
"You really don't know when you're sent what you're going to find," she said. "And not only that, you don't know what conditions you're going to find. Are they in a good mood, a bad mood; do they have pimples; are they in a rush?"
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
She recalled an assignment to shoot Don Johnson when he was starring in the 1980s television series "Miami Vice." Because she wasn't sure when he would have a break from filming, how much time she would get with him or how he would want to be photographed, she had three different setups ready: in the lobby of a hotel near the beach where he was shooting, at the hotel swimming pool and on the beach.
"If Don Johnson had five seconds, or 10 seconds, or a minute, Raeanne Rubenstein was going to be ready," she said. She finally got him by the pool, but not for long: "Our photo session lasted exactly eight frames."
Ms. Rubenstein's marriage to Richard Gordon Burns in 1981 ended in divorce. She is survived by two brothers, Martin and Alan.
Friends said that Ms. Rubenstein was well served throughout her career by an unquenchable curiosity. An example: In 1984 she photographed the singer Cyndi Lauper for a People magazine cover. Ms. Lauper, a fan of professional wrestling, took her to a match, a first for Ms. Rubenstein. The next year Ms. Rubenstein came out with a new book: "Wrestlin': Pro Wrestling Close Up."
Photograph Ms. Rubenstein often said that the key to a good celebrity photograph was establishing trust, something she almost always managed to do. Among her photographs were Dolly Parton, above, on her tour bus in 1979, and top from left: Andy Warhol in 1976; John Lennon and Yoko Ono in 1971; and Johnny Cash in 1975.

Texto completo: KYIV, Ukraine " President Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani met Thursday in Ukraine with one of the key figures working to build a corruption case against Hunter Biden, the Ukraine lawmaker said, after posting Facebook photographs of himself with the former New York mayor.
Andriy Derkach said he pressed Giuliani on the need to set up a joint U.S.-Ukraine investigation into corruption in Ukraine at the meeting in Kyiv. Derkach also vowed to set up an anti-corruption group in the Ukraine parliament.
Giuliani did not make any immediate public comments on the meetings in Ukraine.
But in tweets hours later, he drew connections between future U.S. aid and investigations by Ukraine into former vice president Joe Biden " issues that are already at the center of the impeachment inquiry.
Giuliani tweeted that U.S. assistance to Ukraine on anti-corruption policies could face a 'major obstacle' until the 'conversation about corruption in Ukraine' is resolved. Giuliani alleged 'compelling' evidence of criminal misdeeds by Biden, but gave no specifics.
His presence in Ukraine also advances the efforts of Trump allies to create an alternative narrative in the rapidly moving impeachment investigation " tapping some of Ukraine's most controversial figures who have spread theories of corruption and impropriety around Biden, his son Hunter Biden and Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
The New York Times, which first reported Giuliani's travels, said he had meetings in Budapest and Kyiv this week to meet current and former Ukrainian officials for a documentary.
Derkach noted that their meeting was filmed by 'some kind of American television company' but offered no further details.
'Rudolph Giuliani has arrived in Kyiv. We met up immediately to discuss the establishment of the Friends of Ukraine STOP Corruption interparliamentary group,' Derkach said in a Facebook post.
Derkach, an independent lawmaker who was formerly a member of a pro-Russian party in parliament, went to the Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB in Moscow. He is the son of a KGB officer who later served as head of Ukrainian intelligence.
Derkach wrote that Giuliani could help bring experts, journalists and analysts to investigate corruption in Ukraine and 'benefit strategic relations between Kyiv and the United States.'
Derkach said he had sent letters Tuesday to key Republicans including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.), Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.) and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, seeking their participation.
He said their involvement would help expose the ineffective use of U.S. tax dollars by Ukrainian authorities.
'We sent our proposal. We're waiting for a reaction, an answer. We're waiting to see how much this is something that the congressmen and senators are in need of. If they want to work together, we're ready,' Derkach said.
Derkach said he handed Giuliani documents on allegations relating to inefficient expenditure of U.S. government money on projects in Ukraine and other matters.

The documents do not mention the Bidens. But Derkach makes reference to the energy company Burisma, which had Hunter Biden as a board member.
The right-wing network One America News announced Tuesday it was conducting a 'special investigation' with Giuliani, flying three Ukrainian officials to the United States and 'debunking Schiff's impeachment narrative.'
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) chaired the Intelligence Committee that handed down a report concluding that Trump sought to undermine U.S. democracy and endangered national security.
Derkach did not state whether the TV crew with Giuliani was from One America News.
Derkach and another parliamentary deputy, Oleksandr Dubinsky, called a news conference in Kyiv last month announcing plans to launch an investigative committee of the Ukrainian parliament, claiming corruption by top Ukrainian political figures and Burisma.
The company is at the heart of the impeachment investigation, with allegations Trump withheld military aid to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to open corruption investigations that could have damaged Joe Biden, a potential rival in next year's presidential election.
Analysts have dismissed Derkach as spreading disinformation to support the theory, being promoted by Trump allies, that Biden sought the dismissal of a former Ukraine prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin, because he wanted to protect his son.
Ukraine's prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, said in October that he would carry out an audit to review the handling of all previous cases involving Burisma.
No evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens has emerged, and European powers were also seeking Shokin's dismissal, seeing him as corrupt and an obstacle to reform.
Derkach has previously led calls to investigate the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. In 2017, he wrote a letter to the Ukrainian prosecutor general's office, demanding an investigation into alleged interference in the elections by Ukrainian officials to hamper Trump's campaign, claiming this had 'seriously damaged Ukraine-American relations.'
The July-24, 2017, letter came one day before Trump called on the U.S. attorney general's office in a tweet to investigate 'Ukrainian efforts to sabotage the Trump campaign.'
Derkach and Dubinsky, however, seem to be experiencing difficulty attracting the support of 150 members of parliament " the number required to form the investigative group.
Derkach and Dubinsky have 'zero' chance of forming an investigative committee, said one parliamentarian Thursday, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the issue's sensitivity.
Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and analyst on corruption in Russia and Ukraine, tweeted last month that Derkach and others were spreading 'lies' on behalf of Trump and Giuliani.
'Stay away from them! All lies!' he wrote.
He tweeted Wednesday that Giuliani 'has chosen Ukrainian interlocutors who are criminals - NEVER say anything true.'
On Tuesday, Giuliani met again with another key figure, former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko, in Budapest, according to the New York Times. Giuliani had met previously with Lutsenko, who also has pushed the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in 2016 elections.
The New York Times reported Giuliani was seeking other meetings with two former prosecutors, Shokin and Kostiantyn Kulyk.

J.P. Devine Movie Review: ‘Dark Waters’

Texto completo: It’s the fabulous character actor Bill Camp who plays Wilbur Tennant, the farmer, who, whenever he is on screen, delivers the sure to win Best Supporting Oscar, J.P. Devine writes.
Recipe for an omelet: Mix two eggs with a bit of milk, salt and pepper, add some onions if you like and maybe a few chopped veggies. Oh, be sure to add some polytetrafluoroethylene. You can shorten that to PFOA, and it won’t affect the taste. YOU, it will, but not the taste.
The true story behind Todd Haynes’ “Dark Waters” begins in Parkersburg, West Virginia, which is smack in the lap of DuPont Industries Industries’ chemical plants where DuPont Industries (make sure the children don’t read this) first produced the non-adhesive coating used in Teflon products. That would include the non-stick frying pan you are now using. Don’t worry, DuPont stopped using it in 2013, but there is some of it still in your body. Let me repeat: This is a true story, and one that is, in other states, other countries, other industries and other families, including yours, still going on.
Haynes’ film was adapted from a New York Times Magazine feature story by Nathaniel Rich, entitled “The Lawyer Who Became DuPont’s Worst Nightmare.” I remember reading that, but as time passed I, and probably you, were drowning in 2016’s Great Orange Wave.
This, in a petri dish, is what it’s all about.
In 1998, young corporation lawyer Rob Bilott (a calm Mark Ruffalo) receives a visit in his posh Cincinnati law firm office from a scrubby farmer, Wilbur Tennant (Bill Camp), a friend of his grandma, from Parkersburg, where, by the way, he grew up.
He arrives with a big stack of research and a horror story about how over 100 of his cattle have died horrible deaths, how his kids’ teeth have gotten black, and he himself has developed cancer.
This is no Stephen King horror film, and it’s not fiction I must remind you. This is American history chemical pollution 101. Pay attention. This is about all of us, and it begins in 1975 when a group of kids go midnight swimming in a polluted local lake.
Bilott rejects the message, but is soon convinced after reading one of his kid’s books called “Funny Teeth.” Seriously. This will start a 20-year legal battle — not a solution, just a conclusion. The details in the credits will sicken you.
Bilott’s story, his investigation and climb through the muck and poisoning of Americans and the evil path of corporate malfeasance will threaten his career, his all-American family, and eventually, almost take his life. Haynes adds a touch of “All The President’s Men” with an underground parking lot moment where our hero is afraid to turn the key in his car.
You may start recalling, as I did, Haynes’ film “Safe,” another film that starred Carol White, a California suburban woman (Julianne Moore) who develops “Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or MCS, a stigmatized medical condition, in which the sufferer has recurrent multi-organ symptoms, when exposed to low doses of certain kinds of everyday chemicals.” That one scared me. This one enlarges the fear.
Ruffalo plays, as he did as the tenacious reporter in “Spotlight,” and the pit-bull detective chasing a serial killer in “Zodiac,” the quiet, questioning, smartest guy in the room. He will not stop, not after almost losing his wife, his life and his career. To make the point, Haynes ends the credits with Johnny Cash singing Tom Petty’s “I Won’t Back Down.”
The supporting cast of pros are perfect. Tim Robbins, as Tom Terp, Robert’s boss, will surprise you, both as character and performer.
Anne Hathaway, more mature in technique and fewer mannerisms these days, is saddled with the boring role of supportive wife … until she breaks.
But it’s the fabulous character actor Bill Camp, who plays Wilbur Tennant, the farmer, who, whenever he is on screen, delivers the sure-to-win Best Supporting Actor Oscar. His walk and talk, his pain-filled eyes and broken hands complete a cinematic version of Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” farmer, now fallen to his knees in despair.
Haynes’ “Dark Waters” has none of the subtly of his “Carol,” or complexities of “I’m Not There.” It is what it is, a stark, chilling indictment of the big chem criminals.
J.P. Devine, of Waterville, is a former stage and screen actor.

Pentagon denies Trump considering sending thousands more troops to Mideast to counter Iran

Texto completo: PENTAGON DENIAL: The Pentagon is throwing cold water on a report from the Wall Street Journal that President Trump could decide as soon as this month to dispatch thousands more troops and dozens more ships to the Persian Gulf region to counter Iran.
The report suggested that as many as 14,000 additional U.S. troops could be sent, which would be “significant expansion of the U.S. military footprint in the Middle East.”
“This reporting by the @WSJ is wrong,” tweeted Pentagon Press Secretary Alyssa Farah, “The U.S. is not sending 14,000 troops to the Middle East to confront Iran.”
SO WHAT IS THE PLAN? It’s not clear if Farah is disputing the specific number of troops or the whole idea that the U.S. is considering the deployment of some other number of additional forces to deter Iran.
John Rood, the Pentagon’s undersecretary of defense for policy and Air Force Lt. Gen. David Allvin, director for strategy, plans and policy for the joint staff are both scheduled to provide congressional testimony this morning on “strategic threats” facing the U.S.
“I look forward to hearing tomorrow in Senate Armed Services why the Pentagon reportedly wants 14,000 MORE troops in the Middle East, after sending 14,000 already this year alone,” Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley tweeted yesterday. “Is the Pentagon preparing for a land war?”
Yesterday Rood told reporters “We also continue to see indications, and for obvious reasons I won’t go into the details, that potential Iranian aggression could occur,” according to Reuters.
IRAN THREAT RISING: Meanwhile the New York Times is reporting that U.S. intelligence officials say Iran is building up “a hidden arsenal of short-range ballistic missiles in Iraq,” which it says poses “a threat to American allies and partners in the region, including Israel and Saudi Arabia, and could endanger American troops.”
“American intelligence officials first warned about new Iranian missiles in Iraq last year, and Israel launched an airstrike aimed at destroying the hidden Iranian weaponry,” the Times reports. “But since then, American officials have said the threat is growing, with new ballistic missiles being secretly moved in.”
UNDETERRED: In a series of interviews last month, the U.S. Central Command chief, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, said Iran could be planning a major attack on the scale of the recent missile and drone assault on Saudi Arabia’s oil fields.
“My judgment is that it is very possible they will attack again,” McKenzie told reporters traveling with him to the region. “It’s the trajectory and the direction that they’re on.”
HAPPY TO PAY: At the just-concluded NATO leaders meeting in London, President Trump made a point of saying that he has no problem sending U.S. troops to protect allies, such as Saudi Arabia, so long as those allies pick up the tab.
“You know, Saudi Arabia — we moved more troops there. And they're paying us billions of dollars. OK? You never heard of that before. You've never heard of that in your whole life. We moved troops and we paid nothing,” Trump said during his appearance with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. “We just moved a contingent of troops, and they're paying us billions of dollars and they're happy to do so,” Trump said. “Billions of dollars. It's already in the bank.”

HAPPENING TODAY: Following this week’s Senate testimony by top military leaders about appalling living conditions at privatized housing at U.S. military bases, executives of the companies who provide the housing under U.S. contract are being called to answer questions by the House Armed Services Committee.
“Maybe some of the CEOs need to move into some military housing over the holidays, what do you guys think about that?” Arizona Republican Sen. Martha McSally said Tuesday. “See how they feel about trying to figure out where they’re going to put up their Christmas tree or where they’re going to be serving Christmas dinner.”
Today’s 1 p.m. hearing will feature testimony from John Picerne, founder & CEO, Corvias Group, LLC; John Ehle, president, Hunt Military Communities; Denis Hickey, CEO, Lendlease Americas, Richard Taylor, President, Balfour Beatty Communities, and Jarl Bliss, President, Lincoln Military Housing.
At Tuesday’s Senate hearing Chairman Jim Inhofe railed against the companies. “I have to ask, when is enough enough?” he said. “The time for talk is over … If these companies can’t get the job done, you owe it to the military families to find a company who will.”
SHIPYARD SHORTFALL: A new Government Accountability Office report highlights the critical shortage of ship repair and maintenance facilities that is crippling the ability of the U.S. Navy to keep its fleet afloat.
“The Navy continues to face persistent and substantial maintenance delays that hinder its ability to stay ready for operations and training,” the GAO reports. “Since fiscal year 2014, Navy ships have spent over 33,700 more days in maintenance than expected. Insufficient shipyard capacity and a shortage of skilled workers are among the contributing factors we identified.”
Georgia Republican Sen. David Perdue opened a Senate Armed Services subcommittee hearing on the problem yesterday by noting that in fiscal year 2019, “maintenance delays alone resulted in the Navy losing the equivalent of 19 surface ships. Of our 292-ship fleet, 19 were not available to commanders.”
“Although we've made steady progress, there's still much more to be done,” testified James Geurts, the Navy’s assistant secretary for research, development and acquisition, who pointed the finger back at Congress.
“The biggest threat to achieving the necessary sustained performance is budget instability. In 2019, Congress provided the Navy an authorization and appropriation that was on time for the first time in 10 years,” Geurts said. “This year, although we're well into the first quarter of fiscal year '20, we're on our second continuing resolution. From a ship maintenance standpoint, this has already negatively impacted our planning and contracting for ship maintenance.”
PEARL HARBOR SHOOTING: Two civilians have been killed and a third wounded after an active duty sailor opened fire on them at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii before taking his own life, according to Navy authorities.
“The shooter has been identified as a male U.S. Navy Sailor assigned to the USS Columbia (SSN 771). The incident took place at approximately 2:30 p.m. in the vicinity of the shipyard’s Dry Docks 2 and 3,” said Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on its official Twitter account. “Base security, Navy investigative services and other agencies are investigating the incident. The names of the victims will not be released until the next of kin have been notified.”
No motive for the attack has been established.
RESTARTING TALIBAN TALKS: In his visit to U.S. troops in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving, President Trump announced the U.S. was talking to the Taliban again in an effort to secure a ceasefire that would allow for the withdrawal of some U.S. troops and for peace talks to begin with the Afghan government.
At the time, the Taliban and Afghan officials professed ignorance of any new initiatives, but now the job falls to Amb. Zalmay Khalilzad, the State Department’s special representative for Afghanistan reconciliation, to make it so.
Khalilzad was in Kabul yesterday for consultations with the Afghan government before heading to Doha, Qatar to restart the talks that Trump declared “dead” in September after the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack in the Afghan capital that killed 12 people, including a U.S. soldier.
“Khalilzad will meet with Afghan government representatives and other Afghan leaders to follow up on President Trump’s recent visit and to discuss how best to support accelerated efforts to get all parties to intra-Afghan negotiations,” said a State Department statement. “In Doha, Ambassador Khalilzad will rejoin talks with the Taliban to discuss steps that could lead to intra-Afghan negotiations and a peaceful settlement of the war, specifically a reduction in violence that leads to a ceasefire.”
BAD IDEAS IN NATIONAL SECURITY: The Center for Strategic and International Studies is out with it latest series of short essays on the theme "Bad Ideas in National Security.” The commentaries written by various by CSIS and outside scholars feature some “not too obvious bad ideas,” along with some that would seem to be no-brainers.
For example: “Integrating Artificial Intelligence with Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications,” in which Bryce Farabaugh writes, “Integrating artificial intelligence with nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) to create an automated strategic response system underestimates AI’s potential to inadvertently precipitate a catastrophic mistake.”

Texto completo: Russia's sports program now faces a crisis. The executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, known as WADA, is to meet next Monday in Paris to decide whether Russia should be excluded from all international sporting events, including next year's Tokyo Olympics, for four years. The sanction is harsh, but the offense is odious: Russia has been caught anew manipulating records, smearing a whistleblower and misleading the rest of the world. The executive committee should punish Russia but spare individual athletes who are clean, permitting them to compete as individuals without flag or anthem.
The sordid tale begins at the Sochi Winter Olympics of 2014. Russian sport officials, with help from the FSB, the Federal Security Service, ran a sophisticated operation in which athletes were given performance-enhancing drugs that were concealed by clandestinely replacing tainted urine samples with clean urine. In 2016, Grigory Rodchenkov, head of a Moscow laboratory, revealed the covert program involving dozens of athletes, calling into question the integrity of the competition. Russia was suspended from international sport but reinstated in 2018 on a promise that it would provide WADA with a database from the Moscow laboratory. The Moscow data was considered critical because it would allow an accounting of who among Russian athletes were given the drugs and clear those who were clean of any suspicion. The database, WADA said, would "enable the anti-doping community finally to resolve and draw a line under the allegations of a systematic conspiracy to dope Russian athletes."
But when the database was turned over to WADA on Jan. 10, it contained a whole new set of deceptions that was discovered when investigators compared it with a copy the agency had obtained from Rodchenkov in 2017. Adverse findings were deleted, others backdated and efforts made to cover up the data manipulations, as well. The New York Times reported that "15,325 files and folders containing the 'most relevant antidoping data' had been deleted."
Even more egregious, in the database turned over to WADA, the Russians created fake messages that attempted to smear Rodchenkov by suggesting that he and two others had falsified entries as part of a scheme to extort money from athletes. At the same time, significant original messages were deleted that would provide evidence of the coverup of the doping of Russian athletes in 2014 and 2015. WADA's Compliance Review Committee called the manipulations "an extremely serious case of non-compliance" with its demand for the database and recommended the four-year ban.
The world should not penalize hard-training Russian athletes who are clean and not part of the mess created by their government. But the four-year ban on Russia is not too strong a punishment under the circumstances. As the International Olympic Committee put it, the Russian manipulation of the database is "an attack on the credibility of sport itself and is an insult to the sporting movement worldwide."

Texto completo: Major League Baseball’s plan to cut 42 minor league teams, including the Scrappers in the Mahoning Valley, is a short-sighted move that could erode baseball’s future fan base, said Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, whose family owns the Asheville Tourists in North Carolina.
The Dayton Dragons, Cincinnati’s Class A affiliate, are not on the cut list, but Midwest League members the Beloit (Wisc.) Snappers, Burlington (Iowa) Bees and Clinton (Iowa) LumberKings are.
“Ohio has six minor league teams, each one of which is important to their individual communities as far as the economy of the communities as well as being important to fans,” said DeWine, a lifelong baseball fan. “The long-term concern is if baseball does this, then when the next contract is up, they may eliminate more teams. So this is a real concern for the state of Ohio with six minor league teams.”
He noted that the minor league attendance last year in Ohio was 2.25 million.
The Tourists, a Class A farm team for the Colorado Rockies, is owned by the governor, his wife and their children. Their son Brian DeWine runs the team, which is not on a list of teams potentially being cut according to a report last month by the New York Times.
Both rookie teams of the Cincinnati Reds — the Billings (Mont.) Mustangs and Greeneville (Tenn.) Reds — are on the reported cut list along with Chattanooga (Tenn.) Lookouts at Double-A and Daytona (Fla.) Tortugas at advanced Class A.
Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) has publicly criticized the plan, and a bipartisan “Save Minor League Baseball Task Force” has been formed in the U.S. House to keep tabs on the matter.
Sanders, who is vying to be the Democratic nominee for President, met with MLB commissioner Rob Manfred earlier this week.
“MLB is committed to negotiating with Minor League Baseball to find solutions that balance the competing interests of local communities, MLB Clubs, minor league owners, and the young players who pursue their dream of becoming professional baseball players,” Manfred said in a statement. “We repeatedly have stated both publicly and privately to the minor leagues that whatever the outcome of the negotiations, MLB will offer every community that currently hosts professional baseball options to preserve baseball in a viable, fan-friendly, compelling format with the full support of MLB. We remain confident that solutions can be reached that satisfy the interests of all stakeholders.”
DeWine said minor league baseball is affordable and accessible for families and introduces kids to be lifelong fans.
“That’s what I think is so short sighted on behalf of this proposal where you’d knock off over 40 minor league baseball teams and take that entertainment and opportunity to form more fans. Major League Baseball will lose that and it may not have an impact immediately but in the long run it’s going to have an impact,” DeWine said. “So I think it would be a very short sighted decision.”
Under the uniform contract between the leagues, MLB pays player and coaches’ salaries, which makes minor league teams more economically viable.
DeWine said he likes the excitement of seeing gifted players trying to make it to the big leagues.
“These are all young players who are hustling and trying to live out their dream of making it to the major leagues,” DeWine told the Dayton Daily News. “It’s fun to watch them hustle. It’s fun to watch them play. It’s fun to watch them chase their dream.”

Purdue's Daniels retracts remark

Texto completo: WEST LAFAYETTE – With campus groups and faculty pressuring Mitch Daniels to atone for his choice of words when he called an African American scholar "one of the rarest creatures in America" and the "rarest phenomenon," Purdue's president apologized in a letter sent to members of five organizations on campus.
"I retract and apologize for a figure of speech I used in a recent impromptu dialogue with students," Daniels wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to members of the Purdue chapter of the NAACP, Purdue's Black Caucus of Faculty and Staff, Purdue's Latino Faculty/Staff Association, the Black Student Union and the Latino Student Union.
"My reference was in praise of a specific individual and the unique and exciting possibility of bringing that particular individual to Purdue," Daniels wrote. "The word in question was ill chosen and imprecise and, in retrospect, too capable of being misunderstood. I accept accountability for the poor judgment involved."
Daniels' comment was made Nov. 20 after a meeting with Purdue Student Government leaders. Students greeted Daniels and asked him to follow up on his thoughts about what Purdue was doing to promote diversity on campus and to make underrepresented minority students feel welcome.
That night, Daniels had been pressed by students about his administration's response after a Purdue student had been denied the sale of cold medicine because a clerk and a manager at an off-campus CVS Pharmacy across from Mackey Arena had rejected his Puerto Rican driver's license as sufficient ID. The incident led to student rallies calling on a response from Daniels, which he'd been reluctant to offer.
During the conversation outside an auditorium at Pfendler Hall, Daniels talked about recruiting minority faculty.
"At the end of this week, I'll be recruiting one of the rarest creatures in America – a leading, I mean a really leading, African-American scholar," Daniels said that night, according to a recording made by reporters at the Purdue Exponent newspaper.
When students challenged him on the use of the term "rarest creatures" – "Creatures? Come on," said D'yan Berry, president of the Black Student Union – Daniels followed up: "It's a figure of speech. You must have taken some, you know, literature. Let me say, rarest birds. Rarest phenomenon."
The backlash was swift on social media and among faculty on the University Senate's Equity and Diversity Committee, which issued a statement calling Daniels' phrasing "problematic." The Purdue student chapter of the NAACP on Monday called for an apology in a letter to the Journal & Courier.
And on Wednesday, two weeks later, Daniels' statements were dissected in a New York Times op-ed by G. Gabrielle Starr, president of Pomona College, a private liberal arts college in Claremont, California. In it, Starr wrote that she was breaking from the "standard etiquette for college presidents," which "is to let the remarks of another leader pass on by."
"In just a few sentences, Mr. Daniels seemed to question the possibility of sustained black excellence," Starr wrote in the New York Times op-ed. "It's true that the number of black scholars is smaller than one would like. But they're also suppressed by the fiction that black leadership is an impossible dream – a rare bird."
Daniels told the Journal & Courier two days after his comments: "I've never felt so misunderstood before."
Two weeks later, he issued this apology.
"To be clear, I sincerely believe that individuals of every race and ethnicity are capable of and demonstrate academic excellence and achieve top recognition in all of the academic disciplines," Daniels said. "I also recognize that more needs to be done to recruit, support and encourage individuals from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education. My word choice, as clumsy as it was, was an expression of my excitement with the progress of one such effort."
Berry said she received the apology via email Wednesday afternoon. Berry said the excitement she felt faded when she saw it had gone to a small collection of people, rather than a public statement sent to the entire campus. Berry called it a half-step for something she said she believed Daniels should have done when she pointed out his language to him that night.
"At this point, it is a public matter," said Berry, a senior. "There are other African American scholars all over the world, and people who are not African American scholars, who have taken offense to the statement. At this point, it's not just a list of 10 people you can apologize to just to put a Band-Aid on the situation."
Berry said the murmurs first heard in Pfendler Hall haven't gone away on campus.
"The campus is very upset, especially in the black community, I can say for sure," Berry said. "It's a big issue for people right now, because when you're paying a lot of money to a university that looks at you like a creature, it kind of rubs you the wrong way."
Jorge Perez de Jesus, a Ph.D. student in Latin American literature at Purdue, said he'd been emailing Daniels regularly since Jose Guzman Payano, a Purdue junior from Puerto Rico, had been turned away when he tried to buy cold medicine at the CVS across from Purdue's Mackey Arena. CVS apologized and promised to investigate. Perez de Jesus helped organize a protest that urged Daniels to stand with students, including on off-campus matters.
In his letter to students, Daniels said that "while I am reviewing past judgment calls," he regretted not addressing the CVS situation sooner, given that it "precipitated the impromptu dialogue and therefore the misunderstanding."
"It would have been possible to express the genuine concern we all felt without condemning prematurely any individual or local business establishment before the facts were known," Daniels said. "That was a misjudgment on my part and a lesson for the future."
"I am glad that he's finally acknowledge that his words, as our university leader, matter," Perez de Jesus said Wednesday. "The president's statement lacks specificity. If he were a student in my class, I would point this out. However, it is a step forward, and there is a possibility for further dialogue."
Carey Walls, a Purdue student and Indiana NAACP Youth and College president, said he wanted to meet with other members of Purdue's NAACP chapter after receiving Daniels' email, two days after the group called for a public apology. He said he would reserve comment until then.
Audrey Ruple, chairwoman of the University Senate's Equity and Diversity Committee, said she was "grateful to President Daniels for his statement."
"I am sure this will have a positive impact on our efforts to address the issues surrounding diversity and inclusion at Purdue University and in our greater community," Ruple said.

Texto completo: Congressional Republicans argue that President Donald Trump did nothing wrong related to Ukraine and his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
They released a 123-page report on the impeachment inquiry to counter the majority report by the Democratic-led House Intelligence Committee, which the Judiciary Committee will likely use to craft articles of impeachment.
We found that the GOP report omits key facts and relevant testimony related to the inquiry. Here’s a look at six points in the report that needed a fact-check or additional context.
Claim: There’s no evidence that Trump directed anyone to pressure Ukraine
This claim is directly contradicted by testimony from Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union.
Sondland testified that he, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and former special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, worked with Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani “on Ukraine matters at the express direction of the president.”
Giuliani demanded that Zelensky publicly announce investigations into the 2016 election, the Democratic National Committee and Burisma Holdings in exchange for a White House meeting with Trump, Sondland said, calling Giuliani’s requests a “quid pro quo.”
“Mr. Giuliani was expressing the desires of the president of the United States, and we knew these investigations were important to the president,” he added.
Claim: Whistleblower report was misleading
This ignores that the whistleblower complaint has been backed up by the released summary of the phone call between Trump and Zelensky as well as the public testimony during the impeachment hearings.
Claim: Trump was genuinely worried about corruption
That argument is undercut by multiple pieces of evidence, including testimony by Sondland that Zelensky “had to announce the investigations. He didn’t actually have to do them, as I understood it.”
Trump’s own administration had cleared the way for Ukraine to get the aid. In a letter in May to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Undersecretary of Defense John Rood wrote that he had “certified that the Government of Ukraine has taken substantial actions to make defense institutional reforms for the purposes of decreasing corruption…” The letter gave the go-ahead for security assistance aid.
The Defense Department announced in June that it planned to provide $250 million to Ukraine including for training and equipment.
The timeline of events also shows that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in aid shortly before his July 25 phone call. The whistleblower filed the complaint in August, and on Sept. 9, the inspector general of the intelligence community notified Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., that there was a whistleblower complaint of “urgent concern.” Two days later, Trump released the aid. Nothing in that timeline suggests that Trump acted out of concerns about corruption, or that such concerns were suddenly resolved.
Claim: The assistance was ultimately released
This is literally accurate, but the timeline of events shows that the assistance flowed only after the freeze on aid became public and people criticized it.
The New York Times reported that White House lawyers briefed Trump about the complaint in late August, after it was filed on Aug. 12 but before the hold on aid was lifted on Sept. 11.
The lift occurred just two days after the intelligence community inspector general notified Schiff that the complaint detailed an “urgent concern” and three Democrat-led House committees launched an investigation into Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine and the hold on aid.
Claim: Witnesses didn’t say Trump should be impeached
This is misleading. The witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry did so as fact witnesses, speaking about what they saw, did, or knew related to inquiry matters. They were not there to make legal conclusions.
Schiff during one of the public hearings said that witnesses are not aware of all the facts gathered in the investigation, and that they testified because they were subpoenaed, “not because they are for or against impeachment.”

Texto completo: Just nine paragraphs into his wide-ranging, 50-page report, Michael Atkinson, the intelligence community's inspector general, issued a caution born of partisan attacks on the Ukraine informer.
'The past few months have been a searing time for whistleblowers' rights and protections,' Atkinson wrote in his semiannual report last week.
Appointed by President Trump, Atkinson is the official who upended the White House by telling Congress about the anonymous whistleblower complaint that led to the presidential impeachment process in the House.
Although he and the whistleblower followed proper procedures, they have been subjected to criticisms as messengers of bad news. Trump considered firing Atkinson, the New York Times reported, because the inspector general found the whistleblower's complaint credible.
Atkinson didn't mention Ukraine, but his reference to 'recent events' is clear.
The complaint, about Trump asking Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find damaging information related to a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, was substantially confirmed during two weeks of public hearings last month by the House Intelligence Committee.
Nonetheless, Trump has insisted his call with Zelensky was 'perfect.' Republicans have adamantly defended Trump, as they did in a staff report issued Monday that repeatedly criticized the whistleblower.
Atkinson's defense of whistleblowers comes with a dose of uncertainty.
'Time will tell whether whistleblowers' rights and protections will emerge from this period with the same legal, ethical, and moral strength they had previously,' he wrote. 'It is my hope that recent events will not have a chilling effect on the willingness of individuals within the Intelligence Community to continue to shed light on suspected fraud, waste, abuse, or malfeasance in an authorized manner.'
That chilling effect is real in a government that punishes whistleblowers even as it celebrates them.
Atkinson, along with the other 70-plus inspectors general throughout the federal government, issues twice-yearly accounts of audits, management concerns and other sleepy topics that generate more snooze than news. But Atkinson used his latest report to defend whistleblowers and inspectors general broadly in the face of right-wing attacks.
Calling inspectors general 'first responders' to 'the most egregious matters, abuses of authority,' Atkinson, a former Justice Department official, said they 'are able to fulfill their critical oversight function because, by law, they are independent of the agencies they oversee.' It's a passage administration officials should take as instruction.
Atkinson was not alone among inspectors general whose semiannual reports sent a message supporting whistleblowers.
Kristi M. Waschull, the Defense Intelligence Agency inspector general, used her opening message to champion anonymity for whistleblowers who want it, even as Republicans on Capitol Hill have sought to unmask the Ukraine informant.
'Overall, maintaining confidentiality is of the utmost importance,' she wrote. 'We do not disclose the identity of any whistleblower without their consent " unless disclosure is unavoidable, as required by law.'
Glenn A. Fine, head of the inspector general's office at the Pentagon, added by email that 'whistleblowers need to be protected from reprisals for their protected disclosures.' Waschull's and Atkinson's messages were previously reported by Government Executive.
Atkinson received widespread support from his fellow inspectors general when almost all of them signed a letter backing him in his dispute with Trump's Justice Department.
A Sept. 3 memo from Assistant Attorney General Steven A. Engel concluded that because, in his view, the Ukraine whistleblower's complaint 'does not involve an 'urgent concern,'-' it did not require transmittal to Congress, as Atkinson did.
The letter from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency responded by saying Engel's position 'could seriously undermine the critical role whistleblowers play in coming forward to report waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct across the federal government' and 'has the potential to undermine IG [inspector general] independence across the federal government.'
Allowing other agency officials to second-guess decisions by inspectors general would be contrary to their independence and, the council's letter added, 'may impede the ability of Congress and taxpayers to obtain the objective and independent oversight they rely on from IGs.'
'That would be a grave loss for IG oversight and, as a result, for the American taxpayer,' the letter concluded.
To create safer spaces for whistleblowers, their supporters want Congress to approve additional protections for federal employees who expose waste, fraud and abuse.
Among other measures, advocates have called for legislation that explicitly prohibits revealing whistleblowers' identities if they want confidentiality. One long-standing proposal would allow federal whistleblowers to have civil jury trials in lawsuits against agencies accused of retaliation.
Despite attempts to expose the Ukraine whistleblower's identity and the Trump administration's attempt to undermine Atkinson's independence, he remains confident about the role of whistleblowers in the federal government.
'I am confident that those rights and protections will ultimately emerge stronger, and will not be diminished in any respect,' he wrote. 'My optimism comes from my belief that the American people want an honest and effective government that reflects their hard-fought values.'

This impeachment is too complicated to win over independent voters. That should worry Democrats

Texto completo: What every single House Democrat knows but has refused to say publicly was conveniently published in the New York Times on Wednesday morning.
Caroline Fredrickson, a lawyer who worked at the White House during Bill Clinton's impeachment, rightly observed in an op-ed that the Democrats' case against President Trump is exhausting in its obscurity.
"Today’s allegations," she wrote, "are all over the map and could amount to a lengthy list of articles of impeachment. Unfortunately for House Democrats, the complexity of this story does not help their cause."
Fredrickson goes on to note all of the "norms" Trump has transgressed, and she says he's been "credibly accused" of breaking numerous laws. Fredrickson is a Democrat, so what else is she going to say? Her main point certainly bears on the minds of House Democrats with the weight of a thousand Jerry Nadlers.
The truth about this freak show of an impeachment process is that even if you take the position that Trump did something deadly wrong in his dealings with Ukraine, the story and the details are so abstruse, so convoluted, that the average person would need 40mg of Adderall injected directly into their veins just to sit long enough for processing who all was involved and what the hell Ukraine has to do with any of it.
A very smart person on CNN recently said Democrats should have propped up a flow chart or timeline behind them during the televised hearings last month. Ah, yes! That's the ticket! A flow chart and a timeline! Nothing would stir the passions of the public more than a flowchart on an easel within view behind Adam Schiff's wild eyes.
Frederickson wrote in her op-ed for the Times that Democrats would have been in better shape had there been a more clearly understood violation involved in Trump's actions. Richard Nixon was caught about what he knew of the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters (crime). Bill Clinton was caught lying about his extramarital affair with a young White House intern (crime).
Trump — well, he delayed military aid to Ukraine before having a phone call with the country's president, and in that call, Trump asked him about possibly investigating Joe Biden, and what he did as vice president in Ukraine and also Trump asked about investigating Ukraine's interference in the 2016 election. On top of that, he obstructed Congress, may have done something with payments to a porn actress, and don't ever, ever, ever forget about Russia. Which one is the crime?
Further complicating the case against Trump is that, unlike Nixon, who tried to hide the tapes that did him in, and unlike Clinton, whose DNA was enough to prove he was lying, Trump let everyone know from the beginning what he did with Ukraine. He released the transcript of the phone call with the country's president, and it had everything we needed. That was back in September, and yet, as of this moment, Democrats continue acting like there's a cover-up that needs investigating.
Impeachment isn't going the way Democrats had hoped. Support for it is eroding among independent voters in swing states. In Wisconsin, support for it among independents was at 44% in October, before the main witness hearings began. After those hearings, support fell by four points. Support for impeachment has been, at best, anemic, in every other swing state, according to the Washington Post.
Maybe Democrats should try the flowchart.

Democratic candidates, activists attack their own base for racism, sexism after Kamala Harris pulls the plug

Texto completo: Sen. Kamala Harris of California put her 2020 Democratic primary campaign out of its misery this week, ending at long last a dysfunctional candidacy that was plagued from the start by infighting and a lack of focus.

But don’t blame the senator or her team for their amateur-hour attempt to win her the nomination. The real reason Harris flamed out is because of racism and sexism, according to multiple Democratic officials and activists, who now fret that all of their front-runners are white.

The news media held Harris "to a different standard,” complained 2020 Democratic candidate and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, “a double standard, to other campaigns.”

“I was disappointed by the treatment her campaign got especially during the last seven days,” he added in remarks to BuzzFeed, “when you had the Washington Post, New York Times, and Politico writing very gossipy-sounding big articles trashing the campaign.”

For reference, the most damning details in the reports “trashing” the Harris campaign came from the senator’s own campaign staff. If you want a reason for why her 2020 candidacy did not work out, look no further than the fact that it was staffed with the sort of people who would complain anonymously to newsrooms about all the infighting.

“Kamala Harris officially ended her campaign today, which means that all of the candidates who currently qualify for the December Democratic debate are white,” groused #Resistance hero and alleged journalist Lauren Duca. “White supremacy is not just a Fox News problem, folks.”

For further reference, the supposedly nondiverse, “white supremacy” candidates who have qualified for the December debate are former Vice President Joe Biden, billionaire liberal activist Tom Steyer, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The debate will feature two women, a Jewish man, and the first openly gay presidential candidate in Democratic Party history. Candidates Andrew Yang, who is Asian, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is Samoan American (and the first Hindu ever to serve in Congress), will likely qualify for the debate as well (they have already met the donor requirement; they each need just one more poll to meet the debate’s voter survey requirement). This is apparently not “diverse” enough for some in the Democratic camp.

"We're spiraling towards a debate stage that potentially – we're still fighting to get on it, but could have six people with no diversity whatsoever," complained 2020 Democratic candidate Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is not even close to qualifying for the next debate.

I am starting to think that "diverse" does not actually mean "diverse."

The current December debate lineup is "disaster" for the party, said Democratic strategist Michael Starr Hopkins.

"African Americans and people of color are the base of the Democratic Party, and it’s problematic to not have a single candidate on stage that represents the diverse constituency of the Democratic Party," he told Fox News.

FiveThirtyEight editor in chief Nate Silver said after Harris’ collapse, “If the Democratic Party wants a field that’s representative of its members and its voters, it probably shouldn’t have two states as white as Iowa and New Hampshire vote first every year.”

Wait — am I going crazy here? Did pundits get together this week and collectively decide to erase the memory of Barack Obama’s 2008 victory in the Iowa Democratic caucuses over Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Joe Biden, among others?

CNN contributor Sally Kohn added, “[I]t’s downright effed up that smart, compelling, very experienced, centrist Democratic candidates of color are floundering while a smart but wildly inexperienced, centrist white mayor of teeny tiny city is surging.”

Is no white candidate allowed to succeed now? What's more, Kohn and the others surely must realize that they are attacking the Democratic voter base, accusing the most significant and active part of the American Left of white supremacism. Not only that, but they are accusing most black voters, who do not support nonwhite candidates, of being white supremacists.

Harris’ campaign died a slow, pitiful death because primary voters lost interest in her starting around July 5, after the first round of Democratic primary debates. No higher power forced Harris out. There was no conspiracy by the KKK. She failed simply because Democratic primary voters did not want her, and as her polling fell off, her campaign donations dried up.

Harris was a bad candidate who ran a bad campaign. She could not clearly state what she believed. She surrounded herself with disloyal gossips. Primary voters gave Harris a chance early on, and she even enjoyed decent polling numbers. She generated a lot of buzz with a contrived attack on Joe Biden for his past opposition to the busing of students for the purpose of racial desegregation (she revealed later that she actually agrees with his position).

But later, she was gutted like a fish on national television by one of the minor 2020 candidates. With her prosecutorial excesses and dishonesty coming to the forefront, she also struggled to take a clear position on key issues. Voters ultimately lost interest in Harris after it became clear that she did not have a message beyond: “Vote for me because I want it.”

So don’t shoot the messenger. Also — and I cannot believe I have to say this to Democratic officials and their allies in the press — don’t attack your own base, you idiots.

César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández: Abolish immigration prisons

Texto completo: Near Denver, migrants are locked inside a prison tucked into an industrial quarter. To the southwest, in the vast space between Phoenix and Tucson, they are surrounded by barbed wire in facilities that seem to rise right out of the Sonoran Desert. Imprisoning migrants this way is lucrative for prison corporations and politicians, and it’s common. But the United States hasn’t always embraced the idea.
In 1954, President Dwight Eisenhower’s attorney general, Herbert Brownell Jr., announced a decision to shut down major immigration detention facilities along both coasts, including Ellis Island. While the policy didn’t entirely abolish immigration imprisonment, it came close. A few years later, the Supreme Court declared this a sign of “an enlightened civilization.”
The United States has veered far from the enlightenment that the Supreme Court imagined 65 years ago. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Homeland Security locked up more migrants than ever (the average daily population of migrants in detention facilities in 2016 was 34,000); President Trump’s administration locked up even more (the average population in 2018 was 42,000).
From asylum seekers to longtime legal residents who have committed crimes, immigration prisons spare no one. In them, people — including children, who the United Nations says should never be detained — often find trauma. Two doctors who regularly work with the D.H.S. were so appalled by the agency’s confinement of children that they wrote to Senators Charles Grassley and Ron Wyden in 2018 describing an infant who lost one-third of his body weight over 10 days yet was never given IV fluids or sent to an emergency room. Other children, they added, had their fingers lacerated by heavy doors in a converted medium security prison in which they were confined. Detention is so harmful to children, they concluded, that the “fundamental flaw of family detention is not just the risk posed by the conditions of confinement — it’s the incarceration of innocent children itself.” But the practice continues.
Kamyar Samimi, a green-card holder with 40 years in the United States, died 13 days after ICE agents took him into custody. When he arrived at a private prison in suburban Denver, he told prison officials of medication his doctor prescribed to control an addiction. The prison’s doctor never bothered to see him. Soon his health tumbled; nurses gave him half the medicine that the prison doctor ordered. Nurses said he was faking, hoping to get drugs, an internal review released a year later revealed. Finally, after he had become too ill to be moved into a wheelchair, as he vomited and urinated on himself, prison guards called for an ambulance. Emergency responders arrived four minutes later, but Mr. Samimi stopped breathing before they could get him into the ambulance. His death was tragic, but not isolated. Since Oct. 1, two of ICE’s detainees have died.
It is time to reconsider this practice. The United States should shut down its immigration prison system. The federal government should redirect the billions of dollars it currently spends jailing migrants — $2.7 billion alone in 2017 for ICE’s detention system — to helping them navigate the labyrinthine legal process.
To navigate high-stakes immigration court cases, migrants need the benefit of lawyers, social workers and case managers. Right now, most get none of those. In immigration court, there is no government-paid lawyer, and most detained migrants can’t afford to hire one. But going back to the Reagan administration, pilot projects that offer support consistently display remarkable success getting migrants to show up for court dates and stay out of trouble.
In an immigration court system that handles 200,000 cases a year, there are bound to be some people who flout the rules. And there will be others who get their day in court only to lose. When that happens, two options are available. We could task law enforcement officers with arresting and deporting those people, or we could turn the other way. For decades, the bipartisan consensus has been to rely on arrest and deportation.
But what if we asked this instead: What good comes from locking up migrants? Republicans declare that we need to detain migrants to uphold the rule of law. Democrats add that detention helps keep our communities safe. Neither of these claims stands up to scrutiny.
The rule of law isn’t a blunt hammer. Prosecutors regularly choose whether to go after U.S. citizens who have committed crimes. Even when evidence of guilt is strong, there might be other reasons to let illegal activity slide: Perhaps a first-time offender deserves a second chance or putting a parent in jail would do more harm than good. Whatever the reason, the Supreme Court declared in 1985, prosecutors have “broad discretion as to whom to prosecute”— or in not prosecuting. It’s up to prosecutors to weigh the harm that prosecution seeks to remedy. When it comes to immigration law violations, locking up migrants is applying brute force to a minor transgression.
Fears that migrants will endanger the public are similarly flimsy. First, reams of evidence show that migrants aren’t any more dangerous than people born in the United States. Second, coming to the United States to request asylum, as many people currently locked up by ICE have done, doesn’t suggest a willingness to commit crime.
Even when migrants have a criminal history, immigration prison isn’t the right answer. It’s the job of police officers to prevent and investigate crime. At best, adding ICE to the mix is redundant. At worse, it’s demeaning. Take David Rodriguez’s experience in a Houston prison. Growing up on the streets of Mexico City, he made his way to the United States as a teenager. Years later he had a green card and celebrity status as the chef at a trendy Houston cafe and the owner of a fashionable boutique.
When he and his fiancé were harassed as they returned home one evening, he swung a baseball bat in their defense. A felony assault charge for the incident was ultimately lowered to a misdemeanor, the judge didn’t sentence him to jail, and seven years went by without a problem. When returning home from his honeymoon in Belize, the idyllic days of beachside lounging turned into a nightmare. He was detained by Customs and Border Protection in Miami and then directed to a private immigration prison in Houston, where he was arrested. Despite never having been convicted of a deportable offense, he’d been mistakenly flagged as having committed a felony. He told me he realized how lucky he was to have a family that could afford to hire a lawyer. “Because you’re an immigrant, you’re guilty until proven innocent,” he said.
In the years after President Eisenhower’s administration led the federal government tantalizingly close to de facto abolition of immigration prisons, the country boomed, our cities diversified, and courts maintained a central role resolving disputes in our messy democracy. Growing pains and all, the United States progressed with migrants free to live as ordinary people. Since then, we have swerved far from that past. To put someone behind bars, we should demand an exceptional justification. So far, the government hasn’t found one.

Texto completo: Si te encantan las papas fritas, quizás deberás aguantar tu antojo en los próximos días, pues existe la posibilidad de que haya escasez de este alimento debido a que las temperaturas frías y otras malas condiciones climáticas han arruinado los cultivos de papas en Idaho, Alberta, Dakota del Norte y Minnesota , de donde sacan la mayoría de las papas, según reporta Thrillist.
El problema fue que los agricultores tuvieron que desechar muchas papas –las cuales pueden tardar hasta 100 días en crecer– debido a que se dañaron por el frío.
“La demanda de papas fritas ha sido excepcional últimamente, por lo que los suministros no pueden satisfacer la demanda”, dijo Travis Blacker, director de relaciones industriales de la Comisión de la Papa de Idaho. Debido a esto, se sospecha que el precio de las papas se disparará, especialmente para las variedades más grandes , que son las que se usan para hacer las famosas papas fritas.
Por otro lado, aunque hay muchos que piensan que podríamos estar al borde de un apocalipsis de papas fritas, hay otros expertos que aseguran que no hay nada de qué preocuparse, ya que las cadenas de restaurantes que sirven este platillo pueden encontrar otras formas de satisfacer la demanda .
“No te preocupes por las papas fritas”, dijo Frank Muir, presidente de la Comisión de Papa de Idaho, al The New York Times. “Todavía puedes salir y ordenarlas como lo haces normalmente”.
Y es que hay que recordar que los tres mayores productores de papa del mundo son China, India y Rusia, por lo que podrían surtir al mercado estadounidense en caso de que se necesitara.
Además, las compañías que ofrecen papas fritas tienen la capacidad de congelar su inventario actual por un largo período de tiempo para satisfacer la demanda de sus clientes.
Así que, aunque hay cierto peligro de que se presente una escasez de este producto, las compañías han manejado la situación bien, de manera que podemos seguir disfrutándolo… hasta el momento.

Mast: Let Florida voters decide fate of assault weapons ban

Texto completo: PALM BEACH — U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Stuart, said Monday that putting a Florida constitutional amendment banning assault weapons before voters next year may be the best way to break the stalemate on the controversial gun safety issue.
“I think doing anything at the state level is always the best way to do it,” Mast said.
“That’s not me saying that that’s what the state of Florida should do, but it’s saying, ‘Listen, that’s the best way to do it,’” said Mast, who was at a Florida TaxWatch conference at The Breakers.
Mast drew a comparison to former Gov. Rick Scott’s support for, and signing of, a red flag law in 2018 after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland.
“That’s much better to do at a state level because individual states can go out there and do what they want to do based upon what it is that they believe,” he said.
Florida’s constitution allows citizens to approve amendments at the ballot box.
Gun safety advocates are seeking to place a constitutional amendment banning assault weapons on next year’s ballot.
The amendment, however, would need to garner at least 60 percent of the vote to pass.
Mast called for a ban on "assault weapons" in the wake of the February 2018 high school massacre in Parkland.
Mast, a veteran who lost both legs in an explosion while serving in Afghanistan, has said that firearms such as the AR-15 are weapons of war that are inappropriate for American streets.
In a New York Times op-ed, Mast called on Congress to define "what constitutes an assault or tactical firearm" and ban future sales of such weapons. That position surprised some in GOP circles given that Mast had been first elected in 2016 after campaigning as a Second Amendment defender with the support of the National Rifle Association.
Mast’s call for the ban drew him a pair of GOP primary rivals in the 2018 midterm election. Mast, though, defeated both and won the general election against Democrat Lauren Baer even as, nationally, the Democrats’ blue wave captured 40 seats to regain control of the U.S. House.
Since then, Mast, a hunter and gun owner, has not backed down on his pursuit of gun safety measures.
Mast co-authored legislation known as HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. It passed the House in February but has not moved in the U.S. Senate.
On Monday, Mast said he remains hopeful that measure will become law.
“I was the Republican that led writing that piece of legislation. It’s sitting over in the Senate, it’s probably got the best chance of moving through,” he said.
The measure would extend background checks to non-traditional sales.
“If you think that background checks should happen in brick-and-mortar locations, the ones that currently exist – there’s no change to them – then it should exist in other locations as well, right?” he said. “So, if somebody can’t buy one at a store, they shouldn’t be able to come to my back door to buy one. And that probably has the best chance of moving through nationally through the Senate.”

President Trump’s reversal on vaping the right call for public health

Texto completo: Annie Karni, Maggie Haberman, and Sheila Kaplan of the New York Times describe US president Donald Trump’s proposed ban on flavored e-cigarette products as “a swift and bold reaction to a growing public health crisis affecting teenagers” that Trump backed away from “under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists to factor in the potential pushback from his supporters.”
Maybe they’re right about Trump’s motivations, but they’re wrong about pretty much everything else.
E-cigarettes are not a “public health crisis.” That supposed crisis is not “growing.” And to the extent that teenagers are negatively affected by e-cigarettes, the very “bold reactions” the three writers seem to favor are far more culpable than e-cigarettes themselves.
E-cigarettes are, according to all credible evidence, safer than burning sticks of tobacco — sorry, FDA, you don’t get to tell me I can’t say so.
A few cases of lung injury from black market “street vapes” have been reported, the cause (use of vitamin E in the “juice”) seems to have been identified, and that problem is already disappearing in the rear-view mirror.
Who buys “street vapes?” People who can’t buy the e-cigarette products they want legally, either because of content (cannabis) or age (the teenagers the Times authors imply they care about so much).
Banning flavored e-cigarette products wouldn’t stop teenagers, or anyone else, from getting flavored e-cigarette products. It would just send even more of them to the “street vape” market for those products.
If Trump reconsidered his proposed ban due to political pressure and the desire to be re-elected, so what? A good decision is a good decision.
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt once told a group of lobbyists, who were pushing a policy change at him, “Okay, you’ve convinced me. Now go out and bring pressure on me.”
That’s how politics works. Politicians appease voters and activist groups who can help or harm their careers. Sometimes that works out well for the public, sometimes it works out badly.
In this case it works out well — certainly for the public, and possibly for Trump. Much of the “I Vape and I Vote” demographic presumably falls outside his existing electoral “base,” and for at least some the issue matters enough to swing their votes.
Now Trump’s Democratic opponents need to decide which they value more: Their desire to run everyone’s lives at the expense of actual public health, or public health and those votes.

New impeachment report reveals Giuliani phone records - Who is "-1"?

Texto completo: Phone records obtained by the House Intelligence Committee and made public in a new impeachment report from Democrats show President Donald Trump's personal lawyer speaking to the White House and figures in the Ukraine investigation at key times in 2019, and also reveal contacts between Giuliani a mystery phone number labeled only as "-1" in call records.
"Certainly the phone records show there was considerable coordination among the parties, including the White House," said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
Schiff did not reveal how the call records were obtained, though the legal "Bates" identifiers used in the report might indicate Giuliani's cell phone records were obtained with a subpoena.
It was not immediately clear who the "-1" calls were with - but the New York Times reported that a similar number was found in cell phone records introduced as evidence in the trial of Roger Stone.
"We can't confirm yet who that "-1" number belongs to, but certainly there were indications in the trial of Roger Stone that when he was communicating with the President it would show up in phone records as a 'dash-one' number," Schiff told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview Tuesday evening.
The new report from Democrats also had phone records from Giuliani associate Lev Parnas, who helped Giuliani along with Igor Fruman in Ukraine.
Parnas and Fruman were arrested in early October and charged with illegally funneling foreign money into U.S. elections.
The phone records contained in the new impeachment report also showed Giuliani contacts with Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, as well as phone calls between Nunes and Parnas.
"Devin Nunes, you should have recused yourself at the outset" of the impeachment hearings," tweeted Joseph Bondy, the lawyer for Parnas, who was arrested as he and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman, were leaving the country on a flight to Austria.
While Nunes refused comment to reporters, he told Sean Hannity on Fox News that he didn't really remember calls with Parnas, saying it was 'possible' they had spoken.

Devin Nunes said just now on Hannity: “It’s possible” I talked to Lev Parnas. “l haven’t gone through all my phone records...I don’t really recall that name, I remember that name now because he’s been indicted. But it seems very unlikely I’d be taking calls from random people”
— Natasha Bertrand (@NatashaBertrand) December 4, 2019
Ironically, the revelation of the Nunes-Parnas phone calls came as Nunes filed a $435 million defamation lawsuit against CNN, in which he said, "Parnas was a renowned liar, a fraudster, a hustler, an opportunist with delusions of grandeur."

Texto completo: ’Tis the season for giving, when those of us in the rich world hand each other overpriced scarves that no one much wants.
So every fall I offer an alternative holiday gift guide with suggestions for “gifts with meaning” that save or change lives. This year’s recommendations come with something extra: A reader has pledged $1 million so that for each of the next 10 years, a charity I find most worthy will receive $100,000. In addition, $50,000 will be split among three runners-up, thanks to a few other large donations. And judging from the past, readers will send in many more donations to these groups. We’ve made that easier through a new website.
This year’s top prize goes to support the lifesaving hospital of Edna Adan, a Somali midwife who fights for women’s health, trains doctors and empowers women in her native Somaliland. I’ve seen her work on the ground in two visits to Somaliland, and I’m awed by what she does.
Edna scandalized Somaliland by learning to read at a time when girls were barred from even elementary school there. She later studied in Britain, became a nurse midwife, enjoyed a high-flying career with the World Health Organization — and then used her savings to build a maternity hospital that opened in Somaliland in 2002.
Then she started a university and medical school that is training a new generation of Somali doctors and medical workers, 70% of them female. Edna sent me a photo this year of an all-female surgical team: a woman surgeon, a woman nurse and a woman anesthetist. It’s breathtaking to see in a country that once barred girls from getting any education.
Edna draws no pay from her hospital; instead, she subsidizes it with her United Nations pension. Somaliland remains one of the world’s most difficult places to be born female and has one of the world’s highest rates of maternal mortality.
“It makes you so angry,” she said, recounting the case of a woman who arrived at the hospital unconscious with a retained placenta. Because the husband was traveling and couldn’t authorize her to leave the house, the family waited five days to seek medical attention. “So she died,” Edna said. “She became a statistic.”
Edna is working to empower women in every way she can. After she cared for a disabled woman who had been raped by a taxi driver, Edna pushed for a law against rape. Previously, rape victims were typically forced to marry the rapist, or compensation money was paid between the families, with the rapist getting off scot-free. With Edna’s help, Somaliland this year adopted a law that punishes rape with up to 31 years in prison.
Almost all Somali girls are subjected to an extreme form of genital mutilation: All the genitals are cut away, and the raw flesh is sewn shut with wild thorns, leaving a tiny opening for urine and menstruation. After marriage, the flesh is cut open.
Edna herself was held down and cut when she was 8 years old, and she has been campaigning against the practice since 1976; initially, this got her arrested. But she has made progress, and this year the Somaliland Ministry of Religious Affairs issued a fatwa condemning this extreme form of genital cutting.
So, readers, consider a gift to the Edna Adan University Hospital — and help save a woman’s life.
With the $100,000 prize money that comes with this column, along with what more readers contribute, the hospital plans to buy a machine to produce oxygen — an essential that every hospital needs for babies and adults struggling to breathe. Edna also hopes to start a lab to examine biopsies and Pap smears for cervical cancer and to train staff members to operate it. There is now no place in the country to read Paps, and biopsies are given to someone flying to Ethiopia to hand-carry to a hospital there.
If your holiday giving preferences run elsewhere, the three runners-up will also make excellent use of your contributions. So consider these causes:
FIGHT CERVICAL CANCER. This is a disease that kills more women worldwide than childbirth yet gets much less attention. Cervical cancer is also a painful and humiliating way to die: It is sometimes diagnosed partly by the stench from rotting flesh. What’s more, cervical cancer is relatively cheap and easy to prevent with HPV vaccination (less than $5 a shot in developing countries) or a screen-and-treat protocol for precancerous lesions.
I suggest the Maya Health Alliance in Guatemala, also known as Wuqu’ Kawoq, which works with indigenous Maya villagers. As individuals, we can’t change America’s harsh policy toward Guatemalan migrants, but we can help save the lives of Guatemalan women from cervical cancer. An American doctor, Kirsten Austad, donates her time at the Maya Health Alliance, making the organization’s work particularly cost-effective. Nobody need die in the 21st century of cervical cancer.
FIGHT WORMS AND BLINDNESS. If cervical cancer is a horrific and easily preventable disease for women, a counterpart that strikes men is a parasite-caused disease called elephantiasis. It swells up the scrotum to such huge proportions that men must use wheelbarrows to carry their private parts. It also causes monstrous swelling of the feet of men and women alike so that they look like elephant legs, hence its name.
This disease survives only because the people who suffer these horrors are impoverished. The End Fund is working mightily to eradicate elephantiasis and other “neglected tropical diseases,” including river blindness and trachoma, both excruciatingly painful causes of blindness. They, too, have cheap and simple solutions.
The End Fund also targets intestinal worms, which prey on hundreds of millions of children in poor countries. We deworm our pets in America, but poor children can’t get dewormed even though the cost is less than 50 cents per child; it’s one of the highest-return investments available.
HELP CHILDREN LEARN TO READ. The earlier organizations help needy people half a world away, but Reach Out and Read supports disadvantaged preschoolers right here in the United States. It coaches parents on the importance of reading to their children every evening and gives away children’s books, often to homes without a single kid’s book.
Reach Out and Read is astonishingly cost-effective — about $20 per child per year — because it piggybacks on pediatricians who donate their time. The idea is that pediatricians should not only prescribe antibiotics for ear infections, but also prescribe reading to set up the child for a better future.
So the organization distributes children’s books to the doctors, who hand them out to low-income families with instructions about how to read to a child. If the parent is illiterate, he or she is advised to turn the pages and tell a story using the pictures.
Parents want the best for their kids but sometimes weren’t read to themselves, don’t have a children’s book in the home and have no idea of the benefits of reading to a child. Randomized trials show that despite its low cost, Reach Out and Read has a big impact in getting kids ready so that they can shine in school.
Donations to all these organizations are tax-deductible for Americans. And, of course, there are many other organizations large and small that do outstanding work, too.
I focus in this giving guide on small organizations that readers probably haven’t heard of, but you can also give a flock of chicks to a needy family for $20 through Heifer International, support a refugee at Rescue.org or underwrite a girl’s education for $143 at CARE. Check out FocusingPhilanthropy.org, GlobalGiving.org and Givewell.org for other giving ideas backed by robust evidence.
The new webpage KristofHolidayImpactPrize.org will try to make it effortless for you to support the four organizations described in this column, while also offering more background on the prizes. Focusing Philanthropy will process reader contributions through the webpage, monitor and report on results and reimburse credit card transaction costs, so that 100 cents on the dollar will go to the organization you designate (or you can support the group of them).
Every family gives differently, but in the Kristof household we hold a family meeting each fall and decide which groups to donate to; our kids get a vote as well. We wanted to impress on them when they were small that giving isn’t a sacrifice but a source of meaning and connection.
It used to be thought of as a miracle to cure someone of blindness or heal a disfiguring disease. Now we all have that power. May you enjoy a miraculous holiday season.

Texto completo: HAMM TIME: As the Oscar-touted movie season hits full bloom on U.S. screens, now is a good time to check how a pair of films featuring Jon Hamm are doing with the critics.
Already out is "The Report," a fact-based political drama starring Annette Bening and Adam Driver that deals with an investigation into the CIA's use of torture.
The movie has garnered solid, if not always spectacular, reviews from top critics.
Overall, Rotten Tomatoes reports that 33 critics have given the film an average rating of 6.27 out of a possible 10. Of those 33 critics, 24 gave the film a "rotten" tomato and nine gave it a "fresh."
Hamm did get some good ink from New York Times critic Jeannette Catsoulis, who praised STL's No. 1 celeb for a "spicy performance" as Denis McDonough, President Barack Obama's chief of staff.
The second film, Clint Eastwood's "Richard Jewell," opens nationwide on Dec. 13.
In that film, Hamm plays an FBI agent investigating the pipe bombing at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The title character, played by Paul Walter Houser, was a security guard at the Olympics who was wrongly accused of the crime. The film also stars Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates and Olivia Wilde.
According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has been given an average rating of 7.0 out of 10 from four top critics. From them, the movie got three "fresh" and one "rotten" tomato.
Todd McCarthy of the Hollywood Reporter said Hamm comes "on very strong" in his role as the hard-charging lead FBI agent on the investigation.
Variety's Peter Debruege gives a cap-tip to Hamm for "playing that handsome-on-the-outside, sordid-underneath dynamic that suited him so well in 'Mad Men.'"
WAVELENGTHS: After 42 years of selling radio ads, Greg Kornfeld will lay down his rate card at the end of the year.
Kornfeld has been selling radio time for KTRS since 1996. He began his career back in 1977 with KMOX (1120 AM).
"I know it sounds trite, but I'll miss the people -- both the people in the office and the clients," Kornfeld said, adding that he had no immediate retirement plans.
"I'm sure I'll be doing more traveling, but right now I just will have things to do around the house," he said.
Station boss Mark Dorsey said Kornfeld is "one of the true great people in our profession," adding that he's "a legend in radio sales."
SAFE SPACE: For the last few years, the safeness of St. Louis, or lack of it, has hurt our rankings in a multitude of areas.
So there's little surprise that a list whose core subject is "safety" would have us close to the bottom of the pile.
In the area of "home and community safety," our fair burg came in at No. 179 out of the 182 largest cities in the U.S., according to a list from personal finance website WalletHub.
The only cities deemed less safe were Detroit; San Bernardino, California; and Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Specifically, only three cities had higher rates (per capita) of assaults than St. Louis -- Birmingham, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; and Detroit -- and only three had worse traffic-fatality rates -- Bakersfield, California; Huntington, West Virginia; and Casper, Wyoming.
Other factors used to compile the rankings included forcible rapes, thefts, hate crimes, number of sex offenders, drug-poisoning deaths, pedestrian fatalities, and road quality.
And all this is happening while St. Louis is tied for first, with four other cities, for having the most law enforcement officers per capita.
That means that all eight of our major neighbors finished better when it came to home and community safety, though none cracked the top 100: Nashville, Tennessee (114); Chicago (122); Louisville, Kentucky (129); Indianapolis (133); Cincinnati (144); Springfield, Missouri (145); Kansas City (163); and Memphis (172).
For the record, St. Louis police report there have been 183 homicides so far this year, up from the 167 at this time in 2018.

Texto completo: One reader criticizes the president's lack of deep thinking on policy issues, while another chides The Times for portraying his statement as a flip-flop.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump Remark About Taliban Stirs Confusion" (front page, Nov. 30), about the president's declaration that he had reopened peace negotiations with the Taliban:
There is nothing new about President Trump's penchant to sow confusion wherever he treads. His policies are not the result of deep or long-sustained thinking, but rather the instant reaction to a whim, or to a Sean Hannity professed desire. Often the superficial thought leads to a poor move. Consequently, he and his staff frequently walk it back and say he didn't say what everyone heard.
Unfortunately his quickness to act without listening to professionals and his lack of the intellectual patience of sustained thinking lead to uncertainty about what the United States plans to do and unsuccessful policy.
Simon Raskin
Spring Valley, N.Y.
To the Editor:
"Trump Remark About Taliban Stirs Confusion" is determined to paint a potentially constructive gesture on the part of the president as a flip-flop that has sent the diplomatic corps into a tailspin. It is hard to see pieces like this as fair and balanced.
If President Obama had reversed policy in favor of diplomacy over war, we would have all applauded. The conflict in Afghanistan has been going on for 18-plus years, America's longest war. If this president can end it, good for him. The difference between the left and the right really comes down to this: We on the left concede some points to them; they never concede points to us. If we attack on everything, we lose the high ground.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – In 2016, Donald Trump demolished the Democrats’ vaunted blue wall in the Midwest by winning Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by the slimmest of margins. And he flipped Florida red again after it had gone for Barack Obama in both of his runs for the White House.
Then came 2018.
In last year’s midterm elections, key blocs of voters swarmed precincts in unheard-of numbers compared to recent non-presidential elections, with Democrats — especially women — scoring big victories across the country, including in the Upper Midwest. That flipped control of the U. S. House of Representatives back to Democrats for the first time since 2011.
Now the 2020 election looms large. Democrats believe the president is eminently beatable based on the 2018 gains and his poor job approval ratings. But that may discount just how strong the president’s support is, especially among rural and working-class white voters and retirees.
Just like 2016 and 2018, next year’s election is likely to come down not just to the proverbial swing states themselves but the voting blocs that define them and — importantly — whether they show up at the polls.
More: When are the 2020 presidential election primaries?
Those include working class voters outside Detroit and Pittsburgh. Suburban women outside Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Rural voters in northern Florida, or Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin. Hispanic and black voters in South Florida and southeastern Michigan. They all played pivotal roles in the last two elections, one way or another.
And they will do so again in 2020.
“It would be very hard for Trump to win reelection if he loses two of those states,” said J. Miles Coleman, associated editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a political handicapping and analysis website at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “You can’t take any of them for granted. ”
The list: Who is running for president in 2020? An interactive guide
As in every election, both Democrats and Republicans say they will not only compete in the key states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida, but will look to “expand the map. ” For Democrats, that means trying to take on Trump in states he won, like Arizona and North Carolina. For Republicans, it means going after small Democratic margins in New Hampshire, Minnesota and Nevada.
In the Rust Belt bellwethers and Florida, the swingiest of big states in presidential years, the eventual outcome there may come down to how the candidates do with a handful of groups in each.
Who are these voters? What drives them? And what do Democrats and Republicans need to do to win them over in 2020? Reporters from around the USA TODAY Network took a look at what are considered the key voting blocs in each of the four key swing states and how they could affect next year’s election. Here’s what we learned.
Swing voters in Michigan
Trump won Michigan’s 16 electoral votes by less than 11,000 votes out of nearly 4. 8 million cast, or about two-tenths of 1 percent. Heading into 2020, the consensus among political handicappers is that Trump faces a tough reelection campaign there. Last year, the state elected a Democratic governor, attorney general and secretary of state, while flipping two previously Republican congressional seats blue. Polls show Trump trailing most of the top Democratic candidates.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e. getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t]. initialized)window[t]. process&&window[t]. process();else if(!e. getElementById(n)){var o=e. createElement("script");o. async=1,o. id=n,o. src="https://e. infogram. com/js/dist/embed-loader-min. js",d. parentNode. insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
But nothing’s a given, as both sides know well after 2016. Already Democrats are training dozens of organizers and reaching out to voters in older industrial areas like Livonia, outside Detroit. Trump and his Republican allies, meanwhile, are expected to stage rallies — like one last March in Grand Rapids — as he tries to hold onto the state. Here are some of the key blocs of voters who will have a say in what happens in 2020.
The missing (suburban) voters from 2016
One of the biggest surprises in 2016 was how many voters declined to even cast a ballot for president: More than 75,000 Michiganders who went to the polls didn’t vote for president at all — more than double the number in 2008.
“That’s an amazing number,” said Susy Heintz Avery, a former Michigan Republican Party chairwoman and co-director of the Michigan Political Leadership Program at Michigan State University.
Of those, nearly half — more than 35,000 voters — were from counties won by Hillary Clinton. The state hadn’t backed a Republican nominee since 1988.
Voter apathy may explain part of it, with people turned off by either Trump or Clinton, who did little outreach in the state. Democratic consultant Joe DiSano also said, “It was a question of people thinking it was a foregone conclusion (that Clinton would win). They thought it was taken care of … There’s no question she should have done more on the ground (to get out the vote). ”
In 2020, expect both sides to take nothing for granted, regardless of what the polls say.
“The get-out-the-vote effort is going to be huge in 2020 … Bigger than we’ve seen in a long time,” said Heintz Avery. The question is how many of those missing voters are ready to support the Democratic nominee against the president, or if, in the end, they decide to sit it out again.
African American voters in Detroit (and elsewhere)
Clinton did almost as well in Detroit as President Barack Obama did in 2012, winning 95% of the vote in the majority black city. But Clinton got about 47,000 fewer votes in the city than Obama did.
“Obviously African American votes in the cities … were a key loss for Clinton,” said Matt Grossmann, director of Michigan State University’s Institute for Public Policy and Social Research.
Amid criticism that Clinton took those predominantly Democratic votes for granted, party officials say that’s unlikely to happen again.
Democrats have more than a dozen organizers on the ground in Detroit and are training even more, pointing out that health care protections remain as uncertain as ever and that Trump has tried to gut programs that help pay for development efforts in urban centers. The Trump campaign, meanwhile, is running ads in newspapers and on radio in Detroit touting the administration's record and launching “Black Voices for Trump. ” The campaign says Trump's presidency has greatly helped minority voters by lowering the unemployment rate and notes the president has also enacted criminal justice reforms,
In the 2018 midterm elections, Detroit’s turnout was up 10 points from the previous midterm, a trend that could greatly help Democrats if it holds. But Grossman says the party needs to motivate black voters, not simply expect them to turn out.
“Hillary Clinton managed to convince white voters she cared a lot about racial minorities and their concerns, but it was not enough to mobilize African American voters,” he noted.
Macomb County, the Thumb and the I-75 corridor
John Yob, a Republican campaign consultant, says the real task for Trump in Michigan is to build on increased turnout across the state’s rural counties — including those north along the I-75 corridor, in Michigan’s Thumb and in the Upper Peninsula — to overcome marginal increases in the Detroit suburbs.
But it’s hard to set aside the role that Macomb County, just north of Detroit, played in 2016 when it swung more than 30,000 votes from Obama in 2012 toward Trump.
While Macomb is historically known as a working class area, it has become a somewhat more suburban county, with growing diversity and affluence. Famously independent, with several municipalities like Sterling Heights and Clinton Township serving as swing areas, it retains its reputation for colorful politics and a cache of union-centric voters. It remains a bellwether for Michigan, much as it did when Ronald Reagan was turning elections there.
In 2018, it backed Democrat Gretchen Whitmer for governor, becoming one of several Trump-won counties — including Kent, a traditionally Republican stronghold in west Michigan — to do so and help her get elected.
Now the question for some who voted for Trump in 2016 — like Sterling Heights Mayor Michael Taylor — is whether the president can still count on their support or whether a Democrat could attract those votes. “There’s no amount of prosperity I would use to condone his behavior,” Taylor said earlier this year. Are there others like him in his community? “I know they’re out there,” he said.
If the eventual Democratic nominee can appeal to those voters in Macomb County, it’s possible he or she can use that to woo working class voters all over Michigan.
“It’s won or lost in north Oakland (county), western Wayne, Downriver, Macomb. … It’s won or lost by those families deciding who will make their lives better,” said former state Democratic Party Chairman Lon Johnson.
Swing voters in Pennsylvania
Trump won Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes by about 44,000 votes — or about seven-tenths of a percentage point, marking the first time since 1988 that a Republican presidential nominee won there. Some handicappers consider the state a toss up in 2020, though his viability there may be in question after Democrats saw key gains in last year’s midterms. Still the state is close enough that few are ready to suggest the president can’t do it again.
“It will be a tough slog for him,” said Terry Madonna, a pollster and political scientist at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster. “But I’m not ready to say he can’t win. ”
Here are three voting blocs which could make the difference in Pennsylvania in 2020.
First-time voters
In 2016, Trump won over thousands of new voters as Republican registration efforts showed huge gains while Democratic numbers dipped slightly. The Republican Party added about 240,000 voters in Pennsylvania from January to October 2016, according to state registration records. And nearly 100,000 Pennsylvania Democrats switched to Republican in that time frame, while nearly 40,000 Republicans switched to Democrats, according to state records.
Whether those voters will remain with Trump is a key question, said Madonna.
While little research is available specifically on those new voters, a poll conducted by Franklin & Marshall in October indicated that just 37% of registered voters statewide believe Trump should be reelected. Of the 59% who want a change, four out of five say they’ll vote for whoever runs against him.
And some of those new voters from 2016 are among those considering changing horses.
Barbara Boucher, a 42-year-old Republican from Lawrence County, who registered in 2016, didn’t care for Clinton and voted for Trump. In 2020, she’s open to supporting someone else.
“I’m waiting to see who the Democratic nominee is,” she said.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e. getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t]. initialized)window[t]. process&&window[t]. process();else if(!e. getElementById(n)){var o=e. createElement("script");o. async=1,o. id=n,o. src="https://e. infogram. com/js/dist/embed-loader-min. js",d. parentNode. insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
Rural and blue-collar voters in Steelers Country (and elsewhere)
In 2016, Trump generally trounced Clinton among rural voters and blue-collar voters in Pennsylvania. That was especially true in Steelers Country — areas in and around Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania, where, over the course of decades, manufacturing jobs and once vibrant industrial cities have shrunk or been virtually abandoned. But socially conservative working-class voters remain.
Madonna says many of those voters have begun to feel “left behind … economically and culturally. ” In 2016, Trump beat Clinton by about 12,000 votes across the region. In 2012, Obama beat Mitt Romney there by about 26,000 votes.
It wasn’t just there. Take Erie County in the northwestern part of the state, a former working-class Democratic stronghold that went for Trump. The same was true in some older industrial areas in the center and eastern parts of the state.
There were some signs of shifting back, however, in the 2018 midterms. And manufacturing jobs have shown some small losses this year, despite tax cuts for corporations made in 2017.
“Trump’s probably going to live or die politically on the economy. He will have to make the argument to blue collar workers that he’s made things better,” Madonna said.
College-educated women in the suburbs
Clinton easily won the Philadelphia suburbs in 2016 — beating Trump by about 190,000 votes in the counties that ring the city — thanks in large part to college-educated women, including some Republicans who rejected Trump.
They were also a big reason (along with court-ordered new district lines) that Democrats were able to flip two congressional districts in the region — both won by women — in 2018, says Madonna.
He expects the trend to continue in 2020. But to be decisive for Democrats, they may have to turn out in even larger numbers to offset Republican strength elsewhere.
Trump, meanwhile, will be asking voters to reelect him based on the strength of an economy that continues to show low unemployment and stock market gains instead of the controversies that have enveloped his administration.
A poll this month by the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion indicated that Trump is deeply out of favor with women in the state, with 62% disapproving of his job performance, compared to 50% of men. Among college graduates of both genders, his disapproval rate is 67%.
Still, Chris Borick, director at the institute, says all voting blocs are important to watch in 2020. “When you’re talking about a razor-thin election in 2016 with 40,000-some votes separating the candidates, everything matters. ”
Swing voters in Wisconsin
Trump’s win in Wisconsin in 2016 came as a surprise — the state hadn’t gone for a Republican nominee since Ronald Reagan in 1984 — but some handicappers say it’s likely to favor him again in 2020, said Coleman, from the University of Virginia. He said some of its key suburban counties have been more resistant to Democratic efforts to turn them, and rural voters have remained energized on Trump’s behalf.
The state, which has 10 electoral votes, elected a Democratic governor last year and re-elected its Democratic U. S. senator. But a poll in November by the Marquette University Law School showed that despite Trump’s job approval numbers hovering below 50%, he had a slim lead in head-to-head matchups against three of the top Democratic candidates, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Democrats, meanwhile, are accelerating their organizing efforts and — perhaps most importantly — holding their 2020 nominating convention in Milwaukee with an eye toward retaking the state.

Here are some key voting blocs which could make the difference:
The small-town vote
The Trump wave in Wisconsin three years ago was first and foremost a rural, small-town phenomenon. And no region of the state epitomized that as much as the state’s Seventh Congressional District, which sprawls across Wisconsin’s northern tier.
Trump won the district by 20 percentage points in 2016, compared to just three points for Republican nominee Mitt Romney in 2012.
A key to 2020 is whether Trump can match or exceed his 2016 outcome in the rural parts of the state. If he’s going to win, he’ll need big margins there to overcome his problem attracting votes from urban areas, especially in Milwaukee and Dane counties.
Democratic pollster Paul Maslin says electoral shifts in northern Wisconsin are a byproduct not just of turnout trends but of voters actually switching between the parties, despite reservations about Trump, “because they liked Hillary Clinton less. ”
Many of those same voters still have mixed feelings about Trump but remain skeptical of national Democrats, said Maslin.
Women, college educated voters in the southeastern suburbs
For decades, the most Republican parts of Wisconsin were the suburban counties outside Milwaukee. But in 2016, Trump underperformed there.
For example, the Fifth Congressional District, where Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner has served for more than 40 years, is the only GOP-controlled district in the state where Trump did worse than Romney.
That’s not to say Trump won’t carry most of these communities — he likely will. The question is by how much and whether it’s enough to overcome Democratic strength elsewhere.
Key to that calculus will be how he performs with women and college-educated voters in places such as Waukesha and Ozaukee counties. They may be up for grabs, depending on whether the eventual Democratic nominee is acceptable to voters who may consider themselves moderate or conservatives.
“Our coalitions are changing everywhere,” said GOP pollster Gene Ulm. “I think it’s amazing as someone who works on the Republican side that we’ve grown up our whole lives thinking, ‘These are our people. ’ The thing is, though, they’re really not anymore. ”
African Americans in Milwaukee
After generating massive turnouts for Obama, Wisconsin’s biggest and most urban city — Milwaukee — couldn’t deliver the state and its 10 electoral votes for Clinton.
Part of the reason was a drop in African American turnout in a state Clinton failed to visit at all during the fall campaign and appeared to take for granted.
In 2020, Democrats are promising a much stronger effort to win over what is considered a key voting bloc in the state. The Democratic National Committee says it and the state party are training dozens of new staffers and already have organizers working in both north and south Milwaukee.
“I was there in 2016 watching the tumbleweeds roll down the street. There was no activity,” U. S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Milwaukee, said recently to an audience in the nation’s capital. “We’re not going to ignore those people that are the foundation for the party. ”
Swing voters in Florida
Political observers are predicting another tight race in 2020, though the president may be in a good position to win Florida and its 29 electoral votes again next year. Current polling has Trump in a close race with all the leading Democratic challengers. As for his approval rating remaining below 50%, Aubrey Jewett, associate professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, says Trump “doesn’t have to be real popular. He just has to be a little more popular than the person he’s running against. ”
And there is evidence Florida is leaning Republican. While Democrats made gains in other parts of the country in last year’s midterms, Florida Republicans elected a governor and flipped a U. S. Senate seat. But there are question marks, namely a growing Hispanic population, a swelling number of voters with no listed party affiliations and a new constitutional amendment which could allow some 1. 4 million felons who have served their sentences to vote. Neither party is sure which might benefit.
Here’s a look at some key voter blocs:
Tampa, its suburbs and the I-4 corridor
It’s almost a cliché that Florida’s elections are determined by a simple formula: Democrats win big in the south, Republicans win big in the north, and it all gets decided by the counties separating the two along Interstate 4, running northeast from Tampa to Daytona Beach.
In 2016, it didn’t really hold up, though.
Hillary Clinton took more votes out of the six main I-4 counties than Obama did in 2012 and still lost the state. But a closer look at Tampa and its surrounding counties shows a different story: In those six counties — Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk and Manatee — Clinton also did better than Obama, by about 10,000 votes.
Trump, however, increased Romney’s totals by a staggering 128,000 votes (and that after Romney held his nominating convention in Tampa) and won the region handily.
After a 2018 midterm election that saw Republican Ron DeSantis win the governorship and former Republican governor Rick Scott upend Democrat Sen. Bill Nelson, the region still looks as swingy as ever: A recent New York Times/Siena College poll shows Trump leading all the top Democrats, though within or near the margin of error.
!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e. getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t]. initialized)window[t]. process&&window[t]. process();else if(!e. getElementById(n)){var o=e. createElement("script");o. async=1,o. id=n,o. src="https://e. infogram. com/js/dist/embed-loader-min. js",d. parentNode. insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");
Hispanic and African American voters, especially in south Florida
Democratic hopes of flipping Florida in 2020 also revolve around finding ever larger support in the state’s Hispanic and African American communities, especially in south Florida.
Hispanic people made up about 20% of the eligible voters in 2018’s midterm elections in the state, according to the Pew Research Center. But in Florida, Hispanic voters seldom vote as a monolithic bloc, since a large share of Cuban Americans have tended to swing toward Republicans.
In last year’s governor and Senate races, 54% of Hispanic voters backed the Democrat — somewhat less than the 62% exit polls showed Clinton getting in 2016.
If anything, Democrats are counting on increasing turnout in those communities, looking toward an influx of 30,000 to 50,000 Puerto Ricans who have come to the state since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017. Trump has opposed statehood for Puerto Rico, which may push some Puerto Rican voters toward the Democratic nominee.
Meanwhile, Francesca Menes, a Haitian American woman who resigned as treasurer for the Florida Democratic Party because she was unhappy with the state of Caribbean American voter outreach, warned that Democrats can’t take black immigrant communities from Haiti, Jamaica, the Bahamas and Nigeria for granted.
“One of my frustrations with the party is that they see black voters as monolithic,” she said. “It’s always the narrative that black voters will always turn out, so we don’t need to work for them. ”
Retirees and rural voters, across the state
Trump’s biggest strengths in Florida rest with retirees and white, rural voters.
Exit polls in Florida showed white voters made up nearly two-thirds of the electorate in 2016, and he won them with 64% of the vote. Voters over the age of 50 made up half of the electorate, and he won them by greater than 55% of the vote.
But some of those voters may be up for grabs in 2002. While polls like the New York Times/Siena College poll show Trump with double-digit leads over Biden, Warren and Sanders in north Florida and among white voters overall, he is in a dead heat with Biden among voters over age 65 — a big voting bloc in Florida.
That explains not only Republican efforts to sign up voters but Democratic efforts at places like The Villages, a massive retirement community in central Florida.
“Will they turn out in the same levels and will they ardently support Trump like they did last time?” asked Jewett. “If they do, Democrats are in trouble and Trump’s looking a little better in Florida. ”

'Why are you parroting Russian propaganda?': Hillary Clinton slams Sen. Kennedy for Ukraine claim

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned Sen. John Kennedy on Monday for "parroting Russian propaganda" after the Louisiana Republican said he believed "both Russia and Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election. "
"Sen. Kennedy, why are you parroting Russian propaganda that U. S. intelligence officials tell us are designed to divide our country?" Clinton asked in a tweet. "Did you miss the briefing that day?"
The briefing Clinton asked about was apparently a reference to a New York Times report, based on unnamed sources, which said U. S. intelligence officials had briefed senators that Russia had engaged in a "yearslong campaign to essentially frame Ukraine as responsible for Moscow’s own hacking of the 2016 election. "
Clinton's claim that Kennedy was repeating Russian disinformation came after former National Security Council official Fiona Hill warned lawmakers at an open hearing in the impeachment inquiry last month that the idea that Ukraine, and not Russia, was behind 2016 election interference was a "fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves. "
During an appearance Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Kennedy told host Chuck Todd that he had received no briefing about Russian propaganda, and that while Hill is "entitled to her opinion," Ukrainian meddling in the election had been "well documented" in reports from various news sources.
Kennedy said, "the prime minister of Ukraine, the interior minister, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, the head of the Ukrainian Anti-Corruption League, all meddled in the election on social media and otherwise. " And he claimed that former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko "actively worked for Secretary Clinton. "
Todd asked Kennedy if the Senator was concerned that he had been "duped. "
"You have done exactly what the Russian operation is trying to get American politicians to do," said a disbelieving Todd.
"No," Kennedy said. "Just read the articles. "
Their exchange occurred after Todd asked Kennedy about the uproar he caused last month in an interview with "Fox News Sunday" in which he said did not know if Ukraine or Russia had been behind the cybertheft of emails from the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, despite the U. S. intelligence community's unanimous conclusion that Russia was behind the attack.
The next day, Kennedy admitted on CNN that he "was wrong" about that, explaining he had misunderstood the question. He clarified that there was "overwhelming" evidence Russia was behind the DNC hack. But he said that when it came to 2016 interference in general, "Ukraine did try to interfere, along with Russia and probably others. "
'I was wrong': Sen. Kennedy takes back claim that Ukraine may have been behind 2016 election email hack
More: Despite Fiona Hill warning, Sen. John Kennedy says Ukraine may be behind 2016 DNC hack
Kennedy is far from the lone Republican on Capitol Hill to take up the argument that both Ukraine and Russia could have meddled in 2016 as they try to defend Trump in the impeachment inquiry into allegations that he pressured Ukraine into opening two investigations that stood to benefit him politically: one into the ties between former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, and a Ukrainian energy company, the other into alleged Ukrainian election interference in 2016.
Trump's defenders have said his call for the two investigations were rooted in legitimate concerns.
After Hill's testimony, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss. , said she was "correct that Russia tried to interfere" in 2016, but added that "also, Ukrainians tried to interfere. "
"I'm concerned about both," he said.
Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, disputed Hill's assertion that Republicans were denying Russian meddling and said "it is entirely possible for two separate nations to engage in election meddling at the same time. "
Similarly, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said on CBS News' "Face the Nation" that "there are plenty of ways to interfere in an election" and that Trump wanted "to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016" to avoid future election meddling.
The claims that Ukraine also intervened in 2016 are largely based on statements from Ukrainian officials who criticized Trump in the 2016 campaign for his apparently positive opinion of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a comment that he might recognize Russian's annexation of Crimea.
Kennedy and others have also pointed to a Ukrainian court's ruling that anti-corruption prosecutors acted illegally when they supplied evidence that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort had not disclosed large payments he had received from a Ukrainian political party.
The court ruled that the release of the Manafort information "resulted in meddling in the electoral process of the United States in 2016 and damaged the national interests of Ukraine," according to The New York Times.
And those who say Ukraine also meddled point to a January 2017 Politico article, "Ukrainian efforts to sabotage Trump backfired," which describes a DNC operative, Alexandra Chalupa, who reached out to Ukrainian officials about incriminating information on Manafort.
The Politico reporters, however, found no "top-down effort by Ukraine" to interfere in the election, unlike Russia's campaign, which was "personally directed" by Putin and "involved the country's military and foreign intelligence services. "
When Trump has directly addressed his concerns about 2016, he has focused more on a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine, and not Russia, hacked the DNC.

‘I represent a threat’: Betsy DeVos responds to her unhinged left-wing critics

Texto completo: Other than President Trump himself, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is probably the most hated and most frequently maligned member of the Trump administration. Yet, after both meeting the secretary and covering her tenure as education secretary since 2017, it’s hard for me to see what rational basis critics have for their hatred.
Many Democrats, progressives, and liberal journalists are obsessed with DeVos, and their criticisms are often so hyperbolic that they seem sinister rather than sincere.
For instance, left-wing Harvard students and professors protested DeVos when she spoke on campus, offering not a rational criticism of her policies but instead smearing her as a pro-rape white supremacist. So, too, one Slate writer called the secretary’s due process reforms for college campuses “protections for sexual assaulters (sic)” and accused her of seeking to “go easy on accused rapists.” Meanwhile, the prominent left-wing feminist Jessica Valenti wrote in the Guardian that Devos is “enabling rape deniers” and “treating rape survivors like garbage.”
This is not exactly thoughtful disagreement. Unfortunately, it's pretty much par for the course.
In 2017, New York Times readers voted DeVos the “worst member of the Trump cabinet,” and Democratic politicians regularly scapegoat the secretary. From Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren forming a “DeVos watch” to numerous 2020 Democratic aspirants repeatedly invoking the secretary to score some cheap political points — even at the LGBT issues presidential forum, of all places. If there has been any articulation of an actual basis for their hysterical hatred, then I've never seen it.
Of course, there’s no reason some Americans can’t disagree with the secretary or criticize her tenure. But all in all, Devos's time at the Department of Education has been far from the disaster that leftists, such as those who comprise the New York Times editorial board, warned of during the confirmation process. In fact, DeVos boasts a number of impressive accomplishments. She has reduced the department's staff by 10%. She has rolled out pro-free speech and pro-due process reforms in higher education. She has expanded school choice in Washington, D.C., and she has proposed further expansion in educational freedom in the form of a federal tax credit program to boost scholarship donations.
A nightmare scenario? Not exactly.
So, when I sat down across from DeVos alongside other members of the Washington Examiner editorial board for an exclusive interview in late November, I asked the secretary: “Why do you think that left-wing critics, out of all the people in the Trump administration, have a particular fascination — I would characterize it as an obsession — with you?”
The question prompted the first slight slip in DeVos's gentlewoman-like, calculated demeanor. She let out a laugh and said, “Really? I hadn’t noticed.”
I could tell she’d built up a great deal of frustration with critics who seem to try and tear her down no matter what she does. As to these critics’ motivations, DeVos offered one simple answer: unions.
“I think it comes back to the fact that I'm challenging the education establishment and status quo and, you know, I know that the heads of the two main teachers’ unions, they know that I was effective ... and they don't like that,” the secretary said.
It’s certainly true that the Democratic Party is motivated by teachers’ unions and their political and financial clout. Teachers’ unions give more than $32 million in political donations, and the money almost exclusively goes to Democrats. Their lobbying is, in part, intended to keep the party opposed to the kind of school choice programs DeVos champions — which would be good for students but bad for unions — even though many Democratic voters actually support such reforms.
“I represent a threat,” DeVos said.
She continued: “I continue to call them out on dismal results, poor performance for kids, and — and really, you know, selling a lot of kids short, and protecting the system that actually facilitates that, is really not a happy thing for them.”
DeVos is a threat, indeed. The backlash she has faced offers a case study in what happens to those few in government who dare try to disrupt the status quo. Let’s just hope her experiences don’t successfully discourage future reformers from fighting for educational freedom — or else the establishment will win, but students will ultimately lose.

Texto completo: William Shatner, who played Capt. Kirk on the original "Star Trek" TV series and since starred in a galaxy full of other TV shows and movies, says he's going where many men have gone before: Reading's Santander Performing Arts Center.
Shatner, 88, will appear for a showing of the classic film "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan," followed by a live question-and-answer session Jan. 19, according to the website www.williamshatnertour.com.
The website says he will share "fascinating and humorous stories from portraying the original Captain Kirk in the 'Star Trek' television series and movies, and from his career spanning over 50 years as an award-winning actor, producer, director and writer."
It says audience members will have a chance to ask Shatner their question during the Q&A sessions.
The website says tickets will go on sale Dec. 6 at www.ticketmaster.com. No on-sale time or ticket prices were released.
The Shatner website says a limited number of VIP tickets will be sold that include the best seats, a post-show photo opportunity with Shatner and an exclusive tour patch (no autographs).
Santander has not announced the show, but that date is open on the performing arts center schedule.
It recently was announced Shatner would make a similar appearance at 8 p.m. Jan. 17 at F.M. Kirby Center in Wilkes-Barre. Tickets for that show, at $29.50-$75, are on sale at www.kirbycenter.org.

In a career that has spanned 65 years, Shatner, trained as a classical Shakespearean actor, made his Broadway debut in "Tamburlaine the Great" in 1956 and appeared in a famed episode of the TV anthology series "Twilight Zone" in 1960.
In 1966, he originated the role of Capt. James T. Kirk in the TV series "Star Trek," a show that, despite running just three years, virtually spawned an entertainment genre.
Shatner later returned as Capt. Kirk in seven of the "Star Trek" movies, one of which he directed.
He later starred in the TV series "T.J. Hooker" 1982-86, and won two Emmy Awards and Golden Globe awards for his portrayal of lawyer Denny Crane on both "The Practice" and "Boston Legal," 2004-08. He later received four more Emmy nominations as well as other Golden Globe and SAG Award nods.

Texto completo: Concept goes way back,
but tech has transformed
interactive experience
During a recent episode of NBC's 'Songland' " a prime-time show featuring aspiring songwriters who compete to create hit songs " viewers were exposed to a new form of high-tech advertising.
Midway through the episode, Ryan Tedder, a Grammy Award-winning singer and producer featured as a judge on the show, tinkered with an eye-catching, illuminated keyboard called Lumi. As Tedder played the instrument, a QR code appeared at the bottom of the screen with instructions that read more like commands than suggestions: 'Open Camera, Scan Code, Shop Now.'
In the minutes after the code appeared, NBCUniversal executives say, thousands of viewers did exactly that, using their smartphones to link directly to a website where Lumi was available for purchase. To get there, they didn't have to download an app, call a shopping network or embark on an online hunt. That, executives say, was the point.
'The holy grail has always been you seeing a person on TV talking about a product or wearing a product and being able to buy that product right now,' said Josh Feldman, NBCUniversal's executive vice president in charge of marketing and advertising creative partnerships. 'In the past there's been friction. You have to leave your screen and go to the Internet and search for that product.'
'Nobody has ever done this before in television,' Feldman added. 'It's real-time results, and we can do this across the entire NBC portfolio.'
The name for this fusion of entertainment and mobile commerce is readily comprehensible, and purposefully so: 'ShoppableTV.' It's the latest attempt, among many, to add interactivity to what is essentially a passive medium, and it arrives as traditional television scrambles to adapt to new pressures.
Not only are audiences inundated by various streams of content, but they've also grown increasingly accustomed to navigating an entertainment landscape using their smartphones and without commercial interruption thanks to on-demand services such as Netflix and HBO.
In response, NBC executives are attempting to camouflage advertising inside televised content, pairing advertisers and audiences in a way that feels organic and doesn't prompt people to change the channel.
ShoppableTV's QR codes don't demand attention for long stretches. They appear on screen for about 30 seconds, enough time, executives think, for viewers to unlock their smartphones and point the camera.
Though ShoppableTV is in its infancy, NBC says it has already been rolled out on several occasions beyond 'Songland.' During this year's French Open, a code allowed television viewers to purchase clothing from Lacoste's Novak Djokovic Collection during matches featuring the Serbian tennis star " an event the network labeled a 'first-ever live shoppable event.'
'You can purchase what Novak is wearing on the court,' an announcer said during the sports broadcast, barely concealing his own surprise. 'Show up at your grocery store with that exact same outfit.'
On NBC's 'Today' show, a QR code linked viewers to Walmart, and during the Tour de France, viewers were able to purchase Zwift, a virtual training program for running and cycling. The 'Today' segment, which included encouragement from host Savannah Guthrie and contributor Jill Martin, resulted in about 50,000 QR code scans in five minutes, NBC Universal said.
In addition to tallying the code scans, NBCUniversal can track viewers' purchases, providing the network with a portion of sales revenue generated by the ads. NBC Universal said it doesn't retain any other customer data. The company declined to provide specific sales figures from previous ShoppableTV moments, but said the conversion rate " the number of website visitors who make a purchase " was 30-percent above the e-commerce average.
Merging content with shopping is common online. Instagram and Facebook both allow users to place shopping tags on posts and stories that direct their audience to a product description page and then directly to a website.
Interactive television " also known as 'two-way TV' " is hardly a novel concept. Even older is the idea that what viewers see on their television screens can be purchased in the real world.
'As early as 1944, Macy's brought this concept to television, scheduling Tele-Shopping with Martha Manning (later renamed Macy's Teleshopping) on DuMont's WABD New York,' Lee McGuigan, a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, writes in his 2018 paper, 'Selling Jennifer Aniston's Sweater: The Persistence of Shoppability in Framing Television's Future.'
'Over the next two years, Gimbels in Philadelphia and Kaufmann's in Pittsburgh commissioned short television productions, for in-store exhibition, to showcase merchandise such as women's apparel,' McGuigan adds.
Veterans of 1970s television may remember what was at the time a daring experiment known as Qube. Launched in Columbus, Ohio, the cable television network allowed subscribers to interact with programs via multiple-choice questions and polls that were administered via oversize remote controls of such heft they resembled a book several hundred pages thick.
In his 1995 book 'The Road Ahead,' Microsoft founder Bill Gates predicted interactive television would be one entry point, among several, into the world of commerce, according to a blistering New York Times review at the time.
A few years later, an awkward, handheld bar code reader called CueCat emerged. Like a complicated QR code before its time, the device allowed users to open Web pages by scanning bar codes placed in ads that had been published in magazines and newspapers. The company that created the product, Digital Convergence, went belly-up a year later.
Josh Bernoff, a media analyst who has studied efforts to turn television into a storefront, has written that ShoppableTV is CueCat 'all over again.' He estimates ShoppableTV is among the fifth wave of attempts to create interactive television.
Among the industry, he said, the aspirational idea has for decades been accompanied by its own figurative phrase: 'Buying Jennifer Aniston's sweater,' an achievement that, if attained, would represent the pinnacle of merging commerce and popular televised content. For that reason, he said, the goal has long enthralled television execs.
But selling Aniston's sweater to audiences as it appears on screen has been an elusive goal. And like all efforts that have come before, he said, the latest wave is doomed.
'It's a bad idea that continues to come around again and again,' Bernoff said.
Despite advances in technology and complex digital marketing strategies, the reason, Bernoff said, is so glaringly obvious it's easily missed.
'If you look at the history of television and how people interact with it, there's been huge advances in the level of quality and huge advances in convenience " things like streaming video on demand. But getting people to interact with what's on their television has always been difficult.'
'People are just generally not in the mood for shopping while they're watching TV,' he said.
But NBC executives would appear to disagree and say they are 'doubling down' on investments in technology to bring mobile, commerce and TV together. Unlike in the past, they say consumers have an 'all screen mentality,' a nod to the idea that people increasingly expect their devices to be synchronized.
'Everybody that you know is watching TV with their mobile device in their hand or directly next to them,' Feldman said. 'When we talk about a product [on 'Today'] we know people will immediately do searches and buy that product. We hear that from marketers all the time.'

MAKING IT 10 p.m. on NBC. If you haven't completed your holiday shopping yet, this craft competition show may inspire you to make your own gifts. The hosts Amy Poehler and Nick Offerman ("Parks and Recreation") return for a second delightful season of creative exploration and craft puns. In this premiere, 10 contestants show off their making prowess by creating models of themselves as food items and reimagining their favorite inventions from their childhood. The judges Simon Doonan of Barneys and Dayna Isom Johnson of Etsy offer their expertise while Poehler and Offerman lighten the mood when the stress kicks in.

Carter Oosterhouse ("Rachael Ray") and Taniya Nayak ("Restaurant: Impossible) return to host.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
DIAMANTINO (2019) Stream on Criterion. This comedy just might top this year's list of most peculiar movies. Diamantino Matamouros (Carloto Cotta), a Portuguese soccer star, is inches away from a World Cup victory, his mind consumed with giant puppies frolicking in cotton candy pink clouds. Then he suffers a humiliating loss and his clueless optimism makes way for a sudden realization that the world can be a dark place. The film's zany, inventive plot draws Diamantino into a right-wing conspiracy involving the European Union. There are also evil twins scheming for his fortune, a mad scientist who wants to replicate his DNA and an undercover agent (Cleo Tavares) posing as an African refugee. Glenn Kenny named the movie a Critic's Pick in his New York Times review, writing that it occasionally "feels like an early Adam Sandler comedy remixed by Pier Paolo Pasolini."
TEAM KAYLIE Stream on Netflix. Kaylie Konrad (Bryana Salaz), a teenage celebrity, returns for more court-ordered community service as leader of a middle school wilderness club in Part 2 of this comedy series. She has warmed up to the group, but becomes infuriated when she learns her T.V. show has replaced her with an obnoxious child star.
ALMOST FAMOUS (2000) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. This coming-of-age classic needs no introduction, but here goes. Set in 1973, Cameron Crowe's Oscar-winning semi-autobiographical dramedy follows William (Patrick Fugit), a teenage music journalist who pursues the opportunity of a lifetime: Writing a cover story for Rolling Stone. His assignment sends him on tour with the up-and-coming band Stillwater, and though the acclaimed rock critic Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) warns him not to befriend the stars, William can't help himself. He falls for a self-described "Band-Aid" (Kate Hudson) who, like him, is blinded by the band's fame. Twenty years later, the film lives on: A musical adaptation opened in San Diego this year to positive reviews.

Texto completo: In a 65-page critique of early decisions made by William H. Rehnquist, who was then an associate justice on the US Supreme Court, Harvard Law School professor David L. Shapiro wasted no time getting to his point — which he tucked at the end of his first paragraph.
Basing his view on the justice's written opinions and votes, Mr. Shapiro wrote in 1976 that while Rehnquist was “a man of considerable intellectual power and independence of mind, the unyielding character of his ideology has had a substantial adverse effect" on his work.
Mr. Shapiro, the law school's William Nelson Cromwell professor emeritus when he died at 87 on Nov. 19, was considered a leading intellectual light in the field of federal courts philosophy and theory. And for nearly a half-century he coedited editions of “The Federal Courts and the Federal System," a key text for law students.
“David was the heart and soul of 'The Federal Courts and the Federal System,' " John F. Manning, dean of Harvard Law School, said in a statement.
“He really shaped the field of federal courts. David was able to bring out the complexity and nuance of the law for judges, scholars, and practitioners, and he always did so with clarity and insight," added Manning, who had joined Mr. Shapiro as a co-editor of the book's sixth edition, published in 2010.
Still, Mr. Shapiro's 1976 Harvard Law Review article on Rehnquist probably reached more eyes and ears as it was quoted or paraphrased often by scholars, politicians, and reporters — even in the chief justice's New York Times obituary.
In 1988, two years after Rehnquist was elevated to chief justice, Mr. Shapiro found himself preparing to appear in front of the jurist whose work he had examined in that article, which some conservatives and reporters had characterized as “blistering."
Mr. Shapiro had taken time away from Harvard Law School to serve as deputy US solicitor general, and he soon began arguing cases before the Supreme Court.
There he faced Rehnquist, whose performance in his early decisions “has been markedly below his own capabilities and has in large part been attributable to the inflexibility of his ideological commitments," Mr. Shapiro had written in his article.
Charles Fried, a Harvard Law School professor who, as solicitor general in the Reagan administration, hired Mr. Shapiro to serve as one of his deputies, recalled that some critics questioned the wisdom of hiring “somebody who had been so critical of the chief justice. Well, I knew Rehnquist and I think he couldn't give a damn and it wouldn't bother him a bit. It turned out there was no issue."
Certainly Mr. Shapiro was undaunted by the prospect. In the 40th anniversary report of his Harvard College class, he called his years as deputy solicitor general “an exhilarating time."
The success he enjoyed was partly because Mr. Shapiro was “a lawyer's lawyer," Amanda L. Tyler, one of his former students, wrote for a Harvard Law School publication when he retired in 2006.
As deputy solicitor general, “he must have been a compelling advocate, for he won cases that, even with the benefit of hindsight, seemed like uphill battles," added Tyler, who is now a professor at the University of California Berkeley School of Law.
Mr. Shapiro was “a gifted appellate advocate on behalf of the United States, arguing 10 cases before the Supreme Court," Noel Francisco, the current US solicitor general, said in a statement.
“As a colleague, he is remembered by those here at the department as a rigorous thinker, elegant writer, and warm mentor — open, straightforward, intellectually engaging, and all with good humor."
As a scholar, meanwhile, Mr. Shapiro exhibited enormous influence “in the classroom and intellectually," Fried said.
“There was a remarkable combination of common sense and intellectual rigor," Fried added. “And that was very influential and very inspiring to students — that somehow the two could be brought together."
In the classroom, Mr. Shapiro “wore his erudition lightly, but he was extremely erudite. He knew about all sorts of subjects that were not directly or even indirectly relevant to the subject matter," said Michael C. Dorf, a Cornell Law School professor.
If a student asked a question that was outside the scope of what Mr. Shapiro was teaching, “he would invariably know the answer," Dorf said, adding that he would then, off the cuff, recommend articles and other readings to further illuminate the issue the student had raised.
“He never seemed to be showing off," Dorf said. “It was just sort of matter of fact."
David Louis Shapiro was born in Manhattan, N.Y., in 1932, the only child of Louis Shapiro, an attorney, and Sarah Grabelsky, an art collector.
He received a bachelor's degree from Harvard College in 1954 and graduated summa cum laude three years later from Harvard Law School, where he worked for the Harvard Law Review and was awarded the Fay Diploma, which goes to the student with the highest combined average for three years.
Before returning to Harvard to teach, Mr. Shapiro worked at the Covington & Burling firm in Washington, D.C., and served from 1962 to 1963 as a clerk to John M. Harlan, an associate justice of the US Supreme Court.
“After all of three weeks in my new profession, I have concluded that teaching is an exciting and challenging profession," he wrote for a Harvard class report after joining the Harvard Law School faculty in 1963.
In 1954, he married Jane Bennett, who for many years ran the Wendell Street Gallery in Cambridge, where they lived.
Their daughter, Lynn Mayson Shapiro, who died of cancer in 2011, had been a dancer, choreographer, poet, and memoirist. She had married Erik Friedlander, and they had a daughter, Ava.
“My wife is an art dealer, my daughter a choreographer, my son-in-law a cellist and composer, and his father a photographer," Mr. Shapiro wrote for a 1994 class report. “As for me, that hemisphere of my brain seems to be missing."
A Harvard Law School service will be announced for Mr. Shapiro, whose wife, son-in-law, and granddaughter are his only survivors.
“David was also a law professor's law professor," Dorf wrote in a tribute on his Dorf on Law blog.
Mr. Shapiro was successful in the classroom even though he spoke in a raspy whisper, due to a rare ailment that had required surgery on his vocal chords, and he used a microphone and speaker through much of his teaching career.
He was known for his “kind of a wry, understated sense of humor," Fried said, and the vocal challenge was no exception.
“When I picture him in my mind, his shoulders are bouncing up and down as he laughs, typically at a joke he made at his own expense," Dorf wrote.
To put students at ease as he used a microphone in class, Mr. Shapiro sometimes relied on well-placed quips.
In an interview, Dorf recalled that “one day he comes to class and says in his whispery, raspy voice, 'I have to apologize today. I have laryngitis,' " Mr. Shapiro paused a beat and added with a smile, “I know what you're thinking: 'How does he know?' "

Texto completo: Two men, 7,400 miles apart, each recently behind bars. One is a longtime dissident. The other is — or was — an apolitical man who happened to be a convenient target for a regime that likes to take hostages.
Neither knows of the other. They are indissolubly linked.
The first man, José Daniel Ferrer, is founder of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, the largest dissident organization on the island. In 2003 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for demanding democracy, civil liberties and amnesty. He served eight years in conditions he described, when I met him a few years ago, as a series of “constant terrors.”
Unbowed, he returned to his political work. On Oct. 1, he and several other activists were arrested by Cuban security agents. For weeks his whereabouts were unknown. After his wife was finally allowed a five-minute visit, she reported signs of torture.
Last week, Granma, the Communist Party’s official newspaper, accused the U.S. Embassy in Havana of “orienting and financing the conduct of José Daniel Ferrer, in a clear demonstration of interference in Cuba’s internal affairs and open instigation to violence.” An associate of Ferrer told me he has endured a dramatic physical deterioration and that there are fears for his life; his mentor, Oswaldo Payá, is widely believed to have been assassinated by state agents in a staged accident in 2012.
The second man is a Tehran, Iran-based graphic designer named Ali Alinejad. “On Sept. 24, about seven agents from the intelligence unit of the Revolutionary Guards stormed his home and took him away in blindfold and handcuffs and confiscated his mobile phone and laptop,” his sister, Masih Alinejad, told me recently. “This was done in front of his 11-year old daughter.”
He is now being held without charges in Ward 2A of Evin Prison, where the Islamic Republic isolates, interrogates, torments and sometimes tortures its political prisoners.
He was seized in order to intimidate his sister, a muckraking Iranian journalist who now lives in the U.S. In 2014 she started the online movement My Stealthy Freedom, through which Iranian women posted images of themselves without hijab. It helped inspire some of the most extraordinary acts of courage seen anywhere in years; women prepared to risk imprisonment, and worse, in quiet but unmistakable defiance of the brutal misogyny that defines the Islamic Republic.
In July, Iran’s Revolutionary Court declared the journalist the equivalent of a “hostile government” for her work. In August, six women were sentenced to a combined 109 years in prison for sharing videos connected to her campaign.
And then Iran erupted this month in the largest mass demonstrations since the 2009 Green Movement. The regime is making a point of blaming its troubles on women. “State-owned TV showed a special documentary on the protests to highlight how women were playing a leadership role in the protests and concluded that this is because these women are guided by external forces,” Alinejad tells me.
She offers a telling analogy. “Once the Berlin Wall fell, Communism was finished. Once this wall of black cloth is removed, the Islamic Republic and its discredited political ideology will be gone.”
That’s easier said than done. From Havana to Tehran (and Caracas, Venezuela, to Pyongyang, North Korea), tyrannies have been able to survive decades of isolation and self-inflicted catastrophe with an adroit mix of ideology, corruption, an exit option for the discontented, and ferocious repression of those demanding change.
It also helps that both regimes have prominent apologists abroad — the people who think Cuba’s health care makes up for 60 years of tyranny, or that Iran’s sham elections are an adequate substitute for genuine democracy — along with the much greater number of people who are simply indifferent to what they do.
But tyrannies also have a fatal vulnerability in the face of moral conscience. It’s what gives dissidents their unique, if fragile, power. “I have no fear of being imprisoned,” Alinejad’s brother told her in a stunningly powerful video he recorded shortly before his arrest. “The moment I’m arrested, speak out. ... Be strong and do your work. You are doing the right thing.”
Those are words that Ferrer would instantly recognize as coming from a kindred spirit. Andrei Sakharov, Liu Xiaobo and Nelson Mandela would have recognized them, too. The struggle for freedom is a single struggle. The plight of a dissident in a Cuban dungeon matters not only to Cubans. The fight for women’s rights in Iran matters to anyone who cares for human rights.
As for the U.S., championing dissidents once played a unifying role in a bipartisan foreign policy. Donald Trump’s reluctant but correct decision this week to sign a bill to support Hong Kong’s protesters suggests the tradition isn’t dead. Dissidents deserve that support not just because of who they are, or what they have suffered, or the cause they embody. It’s also because they are, potentially, our most potent weapon in undermining our enemies.
Their cause isn’t, and must never be, lost. On this long weekend, thank Ferrer, the Alinejads and everyone else lighting lanterns of liberty in the world’s dark corners.

Texto completo: Diabetes, whether Type 1 or Type 2, may be the most underappreciated, misunderstood and poorly treated of all common medical problems, and many of the more than 30 million Americans affected by it are paying dearly with their health and lives as a result.
Contrary to what many people think, diabetes is not just a disease of abnormal blood sugar control caused by a lack of insulin or an inadequate response to this crucial hormone.
Rather, diabetes is a chronic, progressive disorder with potentially devastating effects throughout the body. When inadequately controlled, it can injure many critical bodily systems and result in costly, life-disrupting and sometimes fatal consequences. Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, especially when poorly managed, can damage the heart, kidneys, eyes and nerves and result in a heart attack or stroke, kidney failure, blindness, crippling neuropathy and amputations.
Yet a recent national study found that at least three out of four people with diabetes do not adequately control the four major factors that increase the risk of serious complications: blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and smoking. Furthermore, despite significant advances in the delivery of diabetes care and availability of more effective medications, the study revealed that since 2005 for the nation as a whole, there has been little or no improvement in managing diabetes and preventing or delaying the damage it can cause.
David Haitkin, a 65-year-old Brooklynite, takes great care to manage his diabetes. Found in his 40s to have Type 1 disease, which requires daily treatment with insulin, he keeps his weight, blood pressure and cholesterol under control, doesn’t smoke and gets daily exercise walking his dog and walking to work.
After checking his fasting blood sugar level every morning, Haitkin said he administers the appropriate dose of long-acting insulin. He starts his day with a breakfast of oatmeal and eats a regulated amount of mostly complex carbohydrates three times a day “so I don’t end up starved for them.” He relies on healthful fats like olive oil, avocado and nuts, restricts meat portions to 4 ounces or less and eats fish as often as possible. He also takes the blood pressure drug ramipril to help protect his kidneys, and has his eyes examined and the circulation in his feet and legs checked regularly. He said he’s never had a blood sugar crisis - either a level too high or too low - and so far all body systems seem to be functioning normally.
Then he added a very telling observation: “I’ve always had good health insurance at every job and the luxury to take care of myself. Now though, for a lot of people, that’s being taken away.”
Each of the three diabetes experts I spoke with mentioned insurance problems as a major hindrance for many patients who need to keep their diabetes under control. It is the rare policy that covers consultations for diet and exercise, which can reduce the need for medications and require more time than the 15 or 20 minutes allotted to a doctor visit. But even needed medications are often out of reach financially.
“Having good health insurance is the strongest link to receiving comprehensive diabetes care,” Pooyan Kazemian of Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the new study, told me. “Treatment of diabetes is getting more expensive every day. The newer drugs that control blood sugar with fewer side effects are super expensive, with an average monthly cost of about $1,000, and people without health insurance don’t go to the doctor.”
Dr. Mohammed K. Ali, a preventive medicine specialist at Emory University who wrote a commentary about the study, said, “Many people are on high-deductible plans that don’t cover a lot of things that could help them. They may go to the pharmacy with a prescription and discover it’s not covered by their insurance or they can’t afford the copay.
“Yet,” he added, “we’re dealing with a chronic, progressive disease, and if you’re not on top of it, it will get on top of you very quickly.”
Kazemian explained, “Having a persistently high blood sugar level can damage the kidneys, heart, nerves and eyes; consuming a healthy diet with good portion control and getting regular exercise are critical to managing blood sugar.”
Rozalina G. McCoy, endocrinologist and primary care doctor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said, “Diabetes is not just a clinical disease - it’s a public health disease that is multifaceted and very hard to manage.” High levels of blood sugar cause inflammation and damage blood vessels, both large and small, she said, and these vessels are found everywhere in the body, which is why so many systems are affected.
“But normalizing blood sugar alone will not fix the problem,” McCoy emphasized. “High blood pressure increases pounding on blood vessels, high cholesterol causes inflammation and blockages, and smoking also causes inflammation.”
The new study, published in October in JAMA Internal Medicine, analyzed data gathered by the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1,742 nonpregnant adults with known diabetes and 746 adults with diabetes that had not been previously diagnosed. The data revealed that there had been no significant improvement in the diagnosis or treatment of diabetes from 2005 through 2016.
While 70% achieved target levels of blood pressure control, less than two-thirds of those with diabetes maintained their blood sugar at desired levels, the study found. The best news: 85% of diabetes patients were nonsmokers.
All told, success in reaching target goals for managing diabetes was poorest among young adults and minorities as well as those lacking health insurance.
“In general, younger patients are more likely to be undertreated and older patients often get too much care and are overtreated,” McCoy said.

Startup blames trade war for stalled funds

Texto completo: An Iowa cancer treatment startup blames U.S.-China trade tensions for blocking a key investment.
In a letter to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Immortagen Inc. co-founder Kristi Thiel said a Chinese investor can't send a promised $2.7 million to the Coralville company because of tensions between the United States and China. The authority, which loaned Immortagen $100,000 in March 2017, unanimously voted Friday to let the company suspend payments because of the investment stuck across the Pacific Ocean.
Thiel, who did not return multiple calls or emails seeking comment, wrote to the Authority on Oct. 29 that the unnamed Chinese investor's money was supposed to fund the company through 2020. She said Immortagen received awards for two trials that it will complete by the end of next year.
"Both of these trial awards are outside validation that our technology is unique and of high interest," Thiel wrote. "Because of the issue with our current investor, we have been forced to reduce expenses and seek additional investments, and as such, operating capital is at a premium. It is critically important that we focus all resources to be able to conduct both of the critical trials mentioned."
Founded by four University of Iowa researchers in 2014, Immortagen plans to use genetic information from cancer patients' tumors to tell doctors which treatments will be most effective.
In her letter, Thiel wrote that the Chinese investor previously sent $300,000 to Immortagen, but the promised $2.7 million was delayed "because of the current trade issues." She did not provide details.
Economic Development Authority Compliance Manager Paul Stueckradt said Friday he did not know specifically why the Chinese investor had not been able to get money to the company.
Authority spokeswoman Jacque Matsen said the company was up to date on payments prior to Thiel's request. In an email to the Register, she wrote that members of the authority "thoroughly reviewed confidential financial records from Immortagen, Inc. and conferred with the company in making its recommendation."
The $2.7 million would almost triple the amount of money Immortagen has received. In her letter, Thiel wrote that the company secured more than $1 million through October, including $500,000 from Des Moines venture capitalist John Pappajohn.
Pappajohn said Monday that Thiel told him the Chinese government had blocked further investment.
"I think it's a lot to do with Trump and our negotiations," he said. "It's political. It's all a political game."
In July, The New York Times reported that Chinese investment in the United States had fallen almost 90% since President Donald Trump took office. Citing data from Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, the Times reported that Chinese investors pumped $46.5 billion into U.S. companies in 2016. Chinese investment fell to $5.4 billion in 2018.
Trump campaigned on taking a tough stance against China's trade practices, such as its requirement that U.S. companies doing business in China share intellectual property information with Chinese partners.
The two sides have escalated tariffs on one another's imports since Trump took office in January 2017. He announced in October that the U.S. and China were close to a "phase one" trade agreement, but the two sides have not shown signs of progress since then.
The Times' report cited four main reasons for the drop in investment. The Chinese economy has slowed down since Trump took office, and the Chinese government has exercised stricter control over investments going to the United States.
At the same time, tariffs soured some relationships among businesses in both countries. U.S. regulators also received broader authority in 2018 to block foreign investment in domestic companies.
Anson Soderbery, a Purdue University economics professor who studies international trade, said details behind blocked investments like the one involving Immortagen are often difficult to parse. The Chinese government is not exactly forthcoming about how it regulates its investors, he said.
"It's kind of crazy where we are today," he said. "I wouldn't put anything past the current situation. .... When China is involved, it's hard to put your finger on what's going on."

KID BOOK BASH IS FOR THE LOVE OF KATE - AND READING

Texto completo: Kate Dopirak rhymed her way into little kids' hearts. Many agents discourage writers from channeling their inner Dr. Seuss because rhyme often comes off as clunky and forced. But the picture book author excelled at it.
By her 43rd birthday, Ms. Dopirak, the author of "Snuggle Bunny, You're My Boo" and "Twinkle,Twinkle, Little Car," was a rising star in children's literature. As a leader in the southwestern Pennsylvania chapter of the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators, the young woman with a radiant smile was known for how she rallied fellow writers in the brutally competitive world of children's book publishing.
Ms. Dopirak never got to see her fourth book, "Hurry Up!," in print (due out in 2020). She died on Oct. 10, 2018, at age 43 of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare degenerative brain disorder.
In honor of the beloved author, Kate's Kid Book Bash will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dec. 8 at the Ace Hotel in East Liberty. The free event planned by society members is believed to be the first local children's book festival featuring everything from picture books to young adult literature. There will also be story readings, crafts, an illustrator's workshop and a silent auction featuring art of children's book illustrators. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto also has declared Dec. 8 Kate Dopirak Day.
Riverstone Books, an independent bookstore in McCandless, will provide a pop-up bookstore where people can purchase books and have them signed by authors. The bookstore will share the proceeds with Reading Is Fundamental Pittsburgh, where a fund has been established in Ms. Dopirak's name.
The book bash is evidence of Western Pennsylvania's growing community of children's book writers and illustrators. Organizers tapped successful local authors and illustrators - 22 of the 25 featured.
"We can do the book bash because of the concentration of children's books authors here," said Betsy Fitzpatrick, co-organizer and a member of SCBWI. "It's a Pittsburgh moment and a Kate moment. Everyone wanted to do this for her."
One of the headliners is Jonathan Auxier, author of fantasy novels for middle schoolers including The New York Times bestseller "The Night Gardener" and his latest work, "Sweep: The Story of a Girl and Her Monster." Set in Victorian England, the book tells the story of 11-year-old Nan Sparrow, a "climber" who performed the dangerous and dirty job of cleaning chimneys.
When Nan almost dies in a chimney fire, she is rescued by a golem, a monster made of ash and coal, and the two outcasts find their way together. Mr. Auxier said the idea had been percolating in his mind for a couple of decades, and it took him 10 years to write it. Despite his success, he said, "it never gets easier."
Pittsburgh author Sharon G. Flake was at the cusp of the children's book wave when she published her first novel, "The Skin I'm In," in 1998. Addressing themes of bullying, race and self-worth, the book's staying power is evident with the release of a special 20th anniversary edition this year. Ms. Flake will be a draw for the book bash.
Middle grade and young adult books have found an audience not only with kids, but with adults, too. Youth in art is having a moment in cultural history right now, Mr. Auxier said.
"If you had told me 30 years ago that the biggest budget movies would have superheroes wearing spandex, I would have told you you were insane."
The popularity of authors such as J.K. Rowling and Philip Pullman have also pulled in more adults, said Nick Courage, the Pittsburgh-based author of "The Loudness" and his new book, "Storm Blown," about two kids in Puerto Rico and New Orleans, caught in the path of the same powerful hurricane.
"With children's literature, authors are able to tackle epic stories with a lot of heart and empathy. I write middle grade, so I am definitely biased, but I always tell people that middle grade novels make the best gifts for readers of any age," said Mr. Courage, who along with his wife and literary agent Rachel Ekstrom will be at the book bash.
The two helped start Littsburgh, what he calls "the unofficial literary tourism bureau for Pittsburgh," publicizing events and books for all ages and genres.
Other guest authors look to history for inspiration. Leah Pileggi, author of "Prisoner 88" and co-organizer of the book bash, said she got the idea for her historical novel after touring a prison in Boise, Idaho, and hearing about Jack Oliver Evans, a 10-year-old prisoner there in 1885.
When she discovered no one had ever written a book about him, she dug into historical records and wrote a fictionalized account of a boy locked up with hardened criminals.
Sabrina Fedel, author of "Leaving Kent State," found her YA novel in a tragedy still fresh in our collective memory. She was ironing one day when she saw a History Channel program about the shooting at Kent State University on May 4, 1970, when the National Guard opened fire on a crowd of students protesting the Vietnam War.
"It just struck me that this was the perfect young person's story," said Ms. Fedel.
The mother of three would drop her kids off at school, drive to Kent, Ohio, for a few hours of research and rush back to pick up her kids up in the afternoon. She made that trip about 20 times.
Both Ms. Pileggi and Ms. Fedel remember Ms. Dopirak for the inspiration and encouragement she offered at SCBWI events. "She was all about lifting everyone up together," Ms. Fedel said. "She wasn't competitive."
The mother of two and former elementary school teacher was serious about her craft. She wrote daily and attended conferences, doing what was necessary to beat the daunting odds of getting published, said author Sally Alexander.
"Kate was an incredible model. She just came in knowing you had to put in the time for writing."
Ms. Alexander, who is visually impaired, will be accompanied by her guide dog, Dave, at the event when she reads from her book, "She Touched the World: Laura Bridgman."
Ms. Dopirak found early success with Snuggle Bunny, getting a deal with Scholastic just three weeks after she signed with an agent. Then came rejection.
"She didn't sell anything for three years," said her husband, Josh Dopirak. "It was frustrating."
The camaraderie and support of SCBWI helped buoy her on the way to three more book deals with Simon&Schuster, he said.
Stacy Innerst, a former Pittsburgh Post-Gazette artist, also had to endure rejection before he found an agent and began illustrating picture books, including "The Beatles Were Fab," "Ruth Bader Ginsburg" and his latest, "The Book Rescuer," the true story of Aaron Lansky, who helped preserve Yiddish literature.
Mr. Innerst, who won The New York Times/New York Public Library Best Illustrated Children's Books Award, said Ms. Dopirak also cheered him on through the ups and downs.
"Kate was honestly one of the most affectionate and sincere human beings I have ever met," he said. "She was a cheerleader for everyone."
Other authors and illustrators who will be at the event are Katherine Ayres, Joshua David Bellin, Cathy Breisacher, Cori Doerrfeld, Erin Frankel, Marc Harshman, Laurel Houck, Stephanie Keyes, Rachael Lippincott, Frank Murphy, Marjorie Murray, Rebecca O'Connell, Sydelle Pearl, Jim Rugg, Kerrily Sapet, Nora Thompson and Karen Lynn Williams.

Texto completo: Except for Lloyd Richards, who directed six of August Wilson's plays on Broadway, no theater colleague had a longer, deeper collaboration with the great Pittsburgh-born playwright than Marion McClinton. Of the 10 plays in Mr. Wilson's epic American Century Cycle (sometimes called the Pittsburgh Cycle), Mr. McClinton directed the professional premieres of three - two of which were in Pittsburgh - along with two New York premieres, plus a Broadway revival.
They first met when the 33-year-old Mr. Wilson, then a poet, moved in 1978 to St. Paul, Minn. The younger Mr. McClinton, a St. Paul native, was both actor and director at that city's Penumbra Theatre, and when Mr. Wilson switched to playwriting, Mr. McClinton acted in his first two plays, "Black Bart and the Sacred Hills" and, in 1984, "Jitney!"
Their personal relationship grew and lasted. When Mr. Wilson discovered in 2005 that he had only a couple of months to live, he called two friends, asking musician and minister Dwight Andrews to conduct his Pittsburgh funeral service and Mr. McClinton to deliver the eulogy.
Mr. McClinton, 65, died Thursday in St. Paul. His son, Jesse Mandell-McClinton, said the cause was kidney failure. Mr. McClinton also is survived by his wife, Jan Mandell; a sister, Jean McClinton-Herther; and a brother, Fred.
"Marion was the quintessential Wilsonian warrior. He was the first," said Todd Kreidler, Mr. Wilson's close associate and dramaturge. "Honor, duty, political purpose, integrity - he had it all."
Mr. McClinton's early relationship with Mr. Wilson continued when he directed the latter's "The Piano Lesson" at Penumbra in 1993. But it became more intense at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1996, when Mr. Wilson returned to his native city to re-write and expand "Jitney" for its professional premiere, with Mr. McClinton to direct.
That was no accident, according to Mr. Kreidler, who said, "ever since that 1984 Penumbra production, Marion had carried the 'Jitney' script around with him, trying to get someone to do it." In 1995, Mr. McClinton had come to the Public Theater when it staged his own drama, "Police Boys." Four months later it was announced the Public would stage "Jitney."
Artistic director Eddie Gilbert had invited Mr. Wilson to return to Pittsburgh to revise his youthful work, and Mr. McClinton would direct - this time, without the exclamation point in the title.
Mr. McClinton returned to the Public in 1997 to direct Mr. Wilson's "Seven Guitars." In early 1999, the two were back again, as Mr. McClinton directed a revival of Mr. Wilson's best-known play, "Fences."
Since Mr. McClinton was also a playwright - as were two cast members, John Henry Redwood and Keith Glover - Mr. Wilson agreed to join the three in a "playwriting summit," a private conversation about the experience of black playwrights, moderated by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Christopher Rawson, who turned it into a newspaper article headlined "Black in a White Theater World."
In that two-hour conversation, Mr. McClinton pointed out that "August is Michael Jordan at this table. [He's] opened up avenues for other [black] writers. But the thing about affirmative action or quotas is there's a cut-off point. There's a lot of talented young writers who can't bust through because there's a finite number of slots."
That fall, Mr. Wilson was back at the Public for several months to finish writing "King Hedley II" as the opening production at the new O'Reilly Theater, Downtown - with Mr. McClinton again working alongside as director. Mr. Wilson had apparently been searching for a successor to his long-time mentor, Mr. Richards. He had found him in his friend and colleague from St. Paul.
The one break in Mr. McClinton's rich collaboration with Mr. Wilson came in the fall of 2004, when "Gem of the Ocean" was about to open at Boston's Huntington Theater just before its arrival on Broadway. Late in rehearsals, Mr. McClinton was hospitalized by kidney disease, as he had been several times before. It was a crucial stage in the production. Mr. Wilson brought in another director, Kenny Leon.
But their personal relationship remained strong. When Mr. Wilson knew he was dying in the summer of 2005, Mr. McClinton was one of very few colleagues he wanted to see. It was Mr. McClinton who called Jack Viertel, an officer with Jujamcyn Theaters, to suggest that they name one of their Broadway theaters after Mr. Wilson. The honor was announced while Mr. Wilson was still alive to know it.
In summing up what Mr. McClinton meant to many in the theater but especially to Mr. Wilson, Mr. Kreidler said, "Marion brought a deep personal relationship into the rehearsal room. And he was around before August became August."

Texto completo: HANOVER, N.H.
Al Foley, who taught history in these parts for decades and still is remembered in song and lore, was one of the great upcountry raconteurs of his time. He died in 1978, but I met him once and, like so many others marinated in the folklore of this rugged state, knew by heart many of his Yankee tales, including this one with special merit as the New Hampshire primary draws near:
Tourist from out of state to the farmer by the road: Does it matter which road I take to Manchester?
Farmer by the road: Not to me it don't.
This story comes to mind as the uncertainties in 2020 presidential politics deepen, especially in this state, known as the site of the first primary and for its contrary outlook; it's one of only five states, for example, refusing to use mileage figures to number highway exits. With the primary two months away, these questions remain unsettled and, for Democrats, darkly unsettling:
- Does it matter who wins the Iowa causes?
That contest, conducted eight days before the voting here, is no reliable harbinger for what happens here. The list of modern political figures who won Iowa but lost New Hampshire is long: George H.W. Bush (1980), former Vice President Walter F. Mondale (1984), Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas (1988 and 1996), Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri (1988), Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa (1992), Gov. George W. Bush of Texas (2000), former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas (2008), Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois (2008), former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania (2012) and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas (2016).
Indeed, the only candidates in recent years to win both Iowa and New Hampshire in years in which there was no incumbent running for re-election in their party were Vice President Al Gore (2000) and Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts (2004).
So as you contemplate the 2020 Democratic field, remember Professor Foley's story. Does it matter who wins the Iowa caucuses? Not to New Hampshire it don't.
- What effect will the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump have?
Not the one you think (piling on the president and accusing him as a national embarrassment, grifter and perhaps criminal). Something more portentous for the Democrats (distracting the public's attention from the campaigning, and perhaps even the results here).
Recent experience is illuminating: The first day of Trump impeachment hearings drew 13 million viewers for mid-day viewing, which is to say during the period people were at work and ordinarily don't watch television. The last Democratic debate, on primetime after the Intelligence Committee proceedings, drew just half that audience.
Senate Republicans and the White House are contemplating a post-impeachment trial of Mr. Trump that would occur right as the Democrats are campaigning here and in Iowa. That means the five senators who are presidential candidates would be confined to their seats in the Capitol six days a week. The beneficiaries of that could be former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who could be the only top-tier candidates campaigning here. It could also open up possibilities for other candidates, such as businessmen Tom Steyer and Andrew Yang.
- Who will still be in the race by the second week of February?
Not a small factor. A poor performance in Iowa may mean little to voters in New Hampshire, but it could shape the field of candidates who come here after Iowa.
Struggling candidates like Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who held five events here in the days leading to Thanksgiving, might not still be in the race after Iowa. He doesn't have much support to distribute to others, but some of the candidates do.
If, for example, Sen. Cory Booker, who had eight events here in the pre-Thanksgiving weekend, performs poorly in Iowa, he might be forced to leave the race before he even gets to campaign here during primary week. But he has enough support here that its redistribution might be a factor, and if not his voters than surely his activists - an essential element of New Hampshire presidential politics - would be an asset to another candidate.
Iowa could be curtains for many other candidates, including former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who has invested enormous time (232 events already!) in Iowa and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota (second, with 214 events). It could also be the end of the road for Sen. Kamala Harris (77 events), who has made it clear she is making her stand in Iowa.
- What will the independents do?
A quirk of voting here is that independents can take ballots for either party during the primary. Out-of state commentators - the very people who might ask Mr. Foley directions to Manchester - often exaggerate their importance. Their numbers are astonishing but their impact usually is limited. As recently as 2002, they were fewer than the number of Republicans. Now they are by far the largest group of New Hampshire voters, today making up 42% of this state's voting rolls.
Almost no truly independent voters will opt for the GOP ballot; the challenges to Mr. Trump in his own party are paltry and meaningless, even that from a neighboring former governor, William F. Weld of Massachusetts. Many of the independents will take the Democratic ballot. One candidate is working that part of the field hard: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who has roadside billboards all over the state with an ambiguous but poignant message: "A Soldier's Heart."
In 2012, the last time there was only one party contest - Mr. Obama was running for re-election, so only the Republicans had a contested race - independents accounted for 47% of the Republican vote, and 31% of them went for Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.
Generally, however, candidates win the primary here by prevailing among voters affiliated with a major party and not by riding a surge of support from Independents. "You have to win among your registered voters," said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center in Durham. "In a really, really close race with a lot of candidates, the unaffiliated can make a difference. But candidates should not pin their hopes these voters."
But does it matter which road to victory the winner here takes? Not to South Carolina, the next stop on the campaign trail, it don't.

Texto completo: Where you can find homes on the market that are affordable to the typical first-time buyer.
New York City's real estate market is favorable to buyers right now, making this an opportune moment for people who have managed to save enough for a down payment to purchase their first home.
But where to look? Potential buyers may find some guidance in a new study by StreetEasy that determined which neighborhoods had the most homes available with list prices that were affordable to first-timer buyers earning an average income. (The site used all of its local listings from 2018 to build the study.) After all, a larger pool of affordable homes means a greater chance of completing a purchase.
To establish what was affordable, the study calculated the median monthly income of New Yorkers aged 25 to 44 -- the age range of most first-time buyers -- to be $ 5,867, and capped monthly housing costs at 40 percent of that, or $ 2,347. It assumed a 20 percent down payment and a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at 4.06 percent, and factored in monthly taxes and common charges.
StreetEasy researchers reran their calculations for this week's chart, providing The New York Times with updated data and an expanded list of neighborhoods. Below, the 15 neighborhoods with the most homes that were affordable to first-time buyers in 2018.

Texto completo: Former heroin user on the laws that
unfairly sweep up addicts
We gathered along the banks of the Columbia River at sunset. In front of the assembled crowd, a volunteer read the names of more than 40 people in our Oregon community who had died from overdoses. Four of those names belonged to people I loved, including my mom and my best friend, Justin DeLong. I attended this vigil with Justin's mother, Ember. She had watched us struggle with addiction throughout our young adulthood. Now she and I stood arm in arm. We lit candles and thought of Justin, who in 2014 fatally overdosed from heroin I had sold to him " an act that resulted in my conviction and imprisonment for five years.
Increasingly, prosecutors are treating accidental overdoses as homicides and charging the people who provided the drugs with manslaughter or murder. 'Homicide-by-overdose' laws, which have been enacted by the federal government and 25 states, date back to the 1980s. Until recently, prosecutions were relatively rare. But they've soared over the past decade, with drastic year-over-year increases, according to researchers at the Northeastern University School of Law. In Minnesota, the New York Times found that they quadrupled.
These laws are growing in popularity and severity: In 2017 (the most recent year in which this data was collected), 13 states introduced bills to strengthen their drug-induced-homicide laws or create new ones, according to the Drug Policy Alliance. Last year, Rhode Island passed a drug-induced-homicide law that allows for sentences of life without parole. In July, North Carolina passed a 'death by distribution' law that treats an overdose as s econd-degree homicide and carries a sentence of up to 40 years. These are draconian punishments for low-level offenses " and there is no evidence that prosecutions deter drug use or sales.
Justin's and my story is a familiar one. Shortly after high school, we began using OxyContin. When prices skyrocketed, a friend introduced us to a cheaper alternative. At the time, $20 worth of heroin was equivalent to $160 worth of OxyContin. When I tried heroin, I found it anticlimactic. For all the talk about it being a 'hard drug,' the effect was exactly the same as the pharmaceutical I'd been accustomed to using. Justin and I made the switch.
Soon, we were both physically dependent on the drug. Withdrawal causes panic and agony so severe they hijack survival instincts. All the goals we'd had " I once dreamed of going to medical school " fell by the wayside. Our singular mission, day after day, became avoiding withdrawal. It dominated our thoughts and dictated our actions.
To purchase heroin, you have to know someone who has it, or know someone who knows someone who does. Friends and acquaintances formed our network. The vast majority of heroin dealers I met were not in it to make money. They simply supported their own habit by selling to people they knew who were also addicted. The archetypal predatory drug dealer is a myth. For many, a sale is not about ruthless profit; it is about survival.
On March 28, 2014, Justin texted me, looking for a gram of heroin. I had a gram to spare, so I sold it to him for $80. We'd sold heroin back and forth like this for the five years we'd been addicted; I didn't give it a second thought. I learned that Justin had died only when the police raided my apartment the next night. They placed me in handcuffs and told me I was being arrested under a federal law, 'delivery resulting in death,' for Justin's overdose, a charge that they said carried a 20-year minimum sentence. Three months earlier, my mom had overdosed on her Veterans Affairs-prescribed pain medication. I was 24 years old, addicted to heroin and not a dealer in any traditional sense of the word. Justin was my best friend. I thought I had helped him stave off withdrawal; the government said I had killed him. Through a plea deal, I was prosecuted on a lesser charge, 'conspiracy to distribute heroin,' and given five years.
At the time, I assumed this was a fluke. But my situation was fairly common in our criminal justice system. Despite what legislators claim, these laws do not target only high-level dealers. More often, they ensnare people just like me. For example, in Pennsylvania " the state that leads the nation in these prosecutions " roughly half of those convicted in the first six months of 2017 didn't have the traditional dealer-user relationship with the deceased, a New York Times investigation found: They were family members, romantic partners or friends. Similarly, when a Fox affiliate in Milwaukee looked into 100 recent death-by-delivery cases in Wisconsin, it found that only 11 involved higher-level drug dealers.
User-dealers are the most common kind of dealer and the most visible to the police " and therefore the easiest to arrest. Some defendants have been apprehended after trying to save the victim's life, by dialing 911, or administering CPR or naloxone, a medication that can reverse the effects of an overdose. (Good Samaritan laws that are intended to encourage people to call for help during an overdose protect only against arrest for possession, not murder.) Homicide-by-overdose laws discourage people from seeking aid during an overdose, which inevitably leads to more deaths. In recent years, as these prosecutions have picked up, the number of fatal overdoses nationwide has continued to climb.
Incarcerating people with addiction does nothing to address the opioid crisis " it only increases human suffering. Plagued by overcrowding and violence, prisons are not places that nurture the emotional vulnerability necessary for healing. In the two weeks after their release from prison, a person's risk of dying from a drug overdose is 129 times higher than that of the general population, according to a 2007 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.
When I was at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, Calif., brief psychiatric sessions were available for us, and we could get psychiatric medication prescribed that way. But one-on-one mental health counseling with the sole psychologist, responsible for 1,400 inmates, was unobtainable. The Bureau of Prisons ran a drug treatment program, but it focused on criminal thinking patterns instead of the root causes of addiction, such as trauma; I found it unhelpful.
Even so, I was fortunate. Being white and middle class fundamentally shaped my experience within the criminal justice system. My five-year sentence was abnormally low for a delivery-resulting-in-death case. (A black defendant is 75 percent likelier to receive a mandatory minimum sentence than a white defendant who committed the same crime, according to a 2014 University of Michigan Law School study.) Throughout my incarceration, with the life insurance money I had received after my mom's death, I could afford to spend thousands of dollars on phone calls and messages that allowed me to stay in contact with family and friends. These connections provided the social support and the hope for my future that I needed in order to succeed " to avoid returning to prison, and to instead create a fulfilling new life for myself. Upon my release, I could afford to enroll in Portland State University instead of being forced to take the first job that would accept me with a criminal record. I found an avenue to recovery outside of 12-step programs: Today, I live a healthy lifestyle, exercise and surround myself with loving relationships. Despite " and not because of " my incarceration, I recovered.
Society offered no compassionate resources to Justin while he was alive " only a dozen arrests and a prison sentence, none of which helped him overcome addiction. Only after his death did the government indicate that it valued his life. The federal government poured resources into convicting five people for his accidental overdose " me, my roommate who sold me my heroin, his dealer and that man's two dealers " sentencing us to 60 total years in prison for Justin's death. The flow of heroin in our city, Portland, continued without a moment's interruption. In the years after the trial, the rate of fatal heroin overdoses in Oregon even increased.
A public health crisis requires a public health response; it requires us to move beyond blame and find compassionate, evidence-based practices. Increasing access to medication-assisted treatment, naloxone and safe consumption sites are proven methods. We can exact vengeance or we can save lives, but we cannot do both.

Texto completo: When one of my sons does something unexpected, I like to joke: “Who are you and what have you done with my son?” After reading Elizabeth Warren’s three books on politics, I had the same question about her.
The first, "The Two-Income Trap" from 2003, is moderate or even conservative. Some of her arguments on public policy consequences are so well-reasoned that it brings a tear to an economist’s eye. But really, the book is what you’d expect from an academic — thorough work, thoughtful analysis and careful conclusions.
Warren’s thesis: When financial troubles come, life often falls apart — even for two-income families who “play by the rules. ” Higher household incomes could have meant more savings and less risk. But household spending increased as well. With both parents working, a family has less flexibility — thus, “the two-income trap. ”
Warren notes that most of the increased spending came from housing. And she rightly saw a connection between housing prices, K-12 school quality and neighborhood safety. This led her to advocate FOR greatly expanded school choice — vouchers, charters and so on — to break the link between housing and schools.
They can't even be marginally reasonable: Democrats just might reelect Trump, and they'll have no one to blame but themselves.
The policy prescriptions in the book are mild, compared with her later books and her proposals today. This stemmed from her understanding of how subsidies distort markets and inflate prices: “America simply cannot afford mass subsidies for its middle class to buy housing. Besides, direct subsidies are likely to add more ammunition to the already ruinous bidding wars, ultimately driving home prices even higher. ”
She made similar arguments to criticize subsidies for day care. But her analysis and prescriptions were not always impressive. She complains about inflation in higher education without noting the impact of its massive subsidies. And her level of trust toward consumers, particularly the poor and certain minority groups, is not very high.
When the wonk became a politician
Unfortunately, the impressive things about Warren went out the proverbial window when she became a politician. It’s easy to see when you compare "The Two-Income Trap" to her other two political books: "A Fighting Chance," from 2014, and "This Fight Is our Fight," from 2017. Both move toward rhetoric, biography, and boilerplate — and away from careful analysis.
Neither merry nor bright: Stefanik's impeachment dive into Trump's MAGA nihilism reveals dark Republican future
New policy preferences emerge that look like a crass grab for political power. And beyond grand plans that can’t possibly be financed through wealth and income taxes, Warren’s avid embrace of wide-ranging and extensive subsidies — for college, student loan forgiveness, child care and health care — makes no sense and has no apparent cause.
So, here’s the most amazing story in Warren’s books: Her research on bankruptcy leads to political influence. She gets the opportunity to meet with first lady Hillary Clinton and argue against a bill penned by industry lobbyists. Congress and President Bill Clinton support the law. But Warren persuades Hillary Clinton — who persuades her husband to veto the bill.
But here’s the kicker: The bill is reintroduced in Congress the next spring. “This time, freshman Sen. Hillary Clinton voted in favor of the bill. … The bill was essentially the same but Hillary Rodham Clinton was not. … Her husband was a lame duck at the time he vetoed the bill; he could afford to forgo future campaign contributions. As New York’s newest senator, however, it seems that Hillary Clinton could not afford such a principled position. ” Ouch!
Eleven years later, Warren tells the story again in "A Fighting Chance. " This time, she shares Hillary Clinton’s role in persuading her husband to veto the bill but does not mention Hillary Clinton’s affirmative vote in 2001. Of course, Warren’s redacted retelling is a smart political move. But it is also indicative of her emergence as a political animal in her own right.
Fighting becomes a false idol
Her flips on public policy are staggering enough — from one who knew better and opposed to someone who pretended not to know better and supported. The hypocrisy is even worse because she crushed Hillary Clinton for the exact same move — and Warren’s own sins in this regard are far worse.
So, what happened to Warren? I heard Rod Dreher speak at the 2019 Touchstone Conference on “The Benedict Option. " Dreher had been a devoted Catholic but “lost his faith” as he investigated the Catholic sexual abuse scandal for The New York Times. He started to obsess on the important work he was doing. He began to imagine that he was indispensable. He didn’t take steps to ground his work in something greater. In Christian terms, “the good fight” became an idol — and idols always fail.
When Dreher used the term “fight” to describe his crusade, it immediately brought Warren’s last two books to mind — with “fight” in both titles and “fighting” as her most prominent metaphor to paint her own efforts. My best guess — and I think, the most gracious interpretation of her hypocritical flips — is that she has traveled a similar path to Dreher.
Hopefully, Warren will not get to enforce her preferred version of society and her hypocrisies on others. And as Dreher eventually learned, hopefully Warren will find that there are things much more important than “the fight. ” When the ends justify the means, it’s never ultimately good for those who misunderstand — or those they try to influence and control.

Texto completo: It's almost over.
On Nov. 30 Floridians can breathe a sigh of relief and eat their hurricane snacks as hurricane season 2019 comes to an end.
The season was predicted to be unremarkable, yet it was anything but boring.
Not only was tropical activity above average, but historical milestones were made with events such as Category 5 Hurricane Dorian reaching maximum sustained winds of 185 mph - the strongest ever recorded for a storm that made landfall.
There were 20 organized storms in 2019, with 18 earning names, but none of them made landfall in Florida, although some came close. Of all named storms, six developed into hurricanes.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted in May a likely range of nine to 15 named storms of which four to eight were predicted to become hurricanes including two to four major hurricanes.
Tropical systems began spinning before the season even started on May 17 with the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea. There wasn't another named storm for another 54 days when Hurricane Barry came into formation in July.
August was quiet until Chantal came along, but it was September when every week was occupied by tropical news.
September was very active and had historically strong storms in Dorian and Lorenzo.
The season continued its unusual production into November with the rare development of a tropical storm on Nov. 18 in the form of Sebastien.
Through it all Florida made it out mostly unscathed, surprising many given the nature of Hurricane Dorian.
"In 21 years of meteorology, I've never seen anything like Dorian. No one has," said WOFL meteorologist Jayme King. "It's always mystifying seeing something with that much energy so close to home. It only takes one storm to devastate an area. I think we were very lucky."
The highlights of 2019's hurricane season can be summed with some of these notable tropical systems.
Subtropical Storm
Andrea
Subtropical Storm Andrea was by many cases unremarkable except for the timing of the storm having formed 13 days before the official start of hurricane season on June 1. It was the 11th named storm since 2000 to have formed in the Atlantic before the start of the season, and marked the fifth year in a row the Atlantic had an early storm. Originally listed as subtropical depression, Andrea lasted 12 hours before upper level wind shear and dry air brought the storm's short life to an end.
Hurricane Barry
Barry greeted 2019 as the first hurricane of the season on July 10. The low area of pressure moved from over United States into the Gulf of Mexico, where it developed rapidly into a Category 1 hurricane and moved toward Louisiana.
Barry almost made a complete circle (really more of the shape of the number 6) by cutting through Arkansas and heading east to Columbus, Ohio.
Barry caused more than $600 million in damage, and was indirectly responsible for one death where a 67-year-old man of Panama City Beach was killed in a rip current off the coast, according to a report by WMBB.
Hurricane Dorian
Hurricane Dorian is the 2019 storm that will live in infamy.
Rare is it that meteorologists describe a system as historic, but Category 5 Hurricane Dorian was just that. With maximum sustained wind speeds matching only that of the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935, Dorian is recorded as the most powerful hurricane in the Atlantic.
Dorian first caught expert eyes on Aug. 23 and maintained a presence in news headlines until Sept. 8, when it petered out off the coast of Newfoundland.
While Floridians were able to move on from Dorian, as the storm caused only minor damage to the east coast, residents of the Bahamas will not soon forget Dorian's devastation.
Dorian arrived at the Abaco Islands on Sept. 1 with its powerful winds, waves and rainfall.
But the high pressure steering Dorian westward collapsed which caused the Category 5 storm to stall over the island of Grand Bahama for 18 hours, according to NASA data.
In that time span, Dorian brought more than 36 inches of rain. The level of storm surge has not yet officially been defined by the National Hurricane Center, but reports recall a 20-foot wave hitting Abaco. Several videos made their way to Twitter revealing flood waters high above the rooftops of many residential homes. One video shows Grand Bahama International Airport in Freeport submerged in water.
The devastation amassed $2.5 billion worth of damage in Bahamas, $530 of damage was just to the Bahamas' tourism sector. Tourism is forecast for reported loss of $325 million during the high of tourist season in 2019 and 2020, according to the United Nations.
As of now, 67 people people are confirmed to be dead and about 762 people are assisted in five government shelters in Nassau.
Some of the most devastated areas containing fatalities were the illegally constructed shantytowns of Marsh Harbour, according to a report by The New York Times.
Electricity and water distribution systems are gradually returning to the afflicted areas, according to the United Nations, but the damages are massive.
While having little physical impact on Florida, Dorian inundated the Carolinas on Sept. 6 when it made landfall at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, with 90 mph maximum sustained winds.
Most of the force was experienced on North Carolina's barrier islands, which led to the fatalities of dozens of wild horses and cows on the islands, according to The Charlotte Observer. However, three cows were discovered two months later on a different island and are believed to have survived by swimming along a storm surge.
The damage for Hurricane Dorian is still being evaluated by the NHC, and a more detailed assessment is expected sometime in 2020.
Hurricane Humberto
As the Bahamas began tending to its wounds another storm came knocking less than two weeks after Hurricane Dorian. Tropical Storm Humberto.
Luckily, it skirted by the the archipelago and veered from the U.S. as it strengthened into a Category 3 major hurricane but quickly dissipated in the Atlantic because of cool, dry air wrapping itself around the sides of the storm's circulation.
Hurricane Lorenzo
As September continued its assembly line of tropical systems, a tropical depression formed off the coast of Africa on Sept. 20. Five days later Hurricane Lorenzo had formed and was heading northwest before bending east. The next day, Lorenzo quickly intensified into a Category 5 storm with winds blowing up to 160 mph. Its quick gain to power made it the strongest storm to develop in the eastern part of the Atlantic.
But its might was short-lived as the storm brushed by the Azores archipelago where Lorenzo slowly lost strength before becoming an extratropical storm on Oct. 2, giving Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom a brief smattering of strong thunderstorms.
Tropical storm Nestor
Nestor was the last storm to give Floridians a scare, specifically residents of the Florida panhandle who are still recovering from the massive damages accumulated from Category 5 Hurricane Michael in 2018.
A tropical depression formed off the southern tip of Mexico and became Tropical Storm Nestor three days later. Multiple storm models predicted Nestor passing through the panhandle; one projection showed Nestor taking the same path as Michael and making landfall at Tyndall Air Force Base.
Instead, Nestor lost strength and became extratropical while making landfall at Port St. Joe. Nestor produced storm surge and flooding across the panhandle.
Central Florida was affected with outer bands which produced several tornadoes throughout Polk County. One tornado caused a four-car wreck on Interstate 4, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
The system caused a semi truck to overturn onto an SUV near the State Road 570 exit, FHP said. Two other vehicles were hit by debris caught in the wind; no injuries were reported.
The tornado also ripped the roof off Kathleen Middle School in Lakeland while knocking down power lines.
Orlando did not experience tornadoes but did have a rain-soaked Saturday.
Hurricane Pablo
The final hurricane of 2019 also proved to be a historical storm. Hurricane Pablo formed Oct. 27 and became the farthest east an Atlantic named storm has ever become a hurricane on record, according to Colorado State University professor Philip Klotzbach.
Pablo was 535 miles northeast of the Azores and never made landfall.
Tropical Storm
Sebastien
The final named storm of the 2019 season, Tropical Storm Sebastien, formed less than a week ago on Nov. 18, according to the NHC.
While unusual, November storms aren't unheard of with only 47 hurricanes having ever developed in 168 years of NOAA recording named storms.
Sebastien headed northeast and dissipated.

Stabbings on London Bridge Kill at Least 2 in 'Terrorist Incident'

Texto completo: LONDON — Police shot and killed a man wearing a fake bomb on London Bridge on Friday, after he fatally stabbed two people and wounded three others in what police called a terrorist incident, jolting Britain's capital two weeks before a general election and three days before world leaders were to gather here for a NATO summit.
The chaotic eruption of violence drew in several police officers and civilians, sent scores of panicked pedestrians fleeing from the bridge and nearby streets on both sides of the Thames, and evoked memories of an eerily similar terrorist attack on the same bridge in 2017 that killed eight people.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who halted his campaign to rush back to 10 Downing Street, declared that “this country will never be cowed or divided or intimidated by this sort of attack." He paid tribute to the bravery of the passersby who he said intervened to prevent further bloodshed.
Dramatic video posted on social media showed a crowd surrounding a man, whom they appeared to have tackled. As they wrestled with and held the man to the ground, at least three police officers responded with their guns drawn. One video depicted a man in suit and overcoat holding a long knife that apparently had been taken from the attacker.
Police pulled the other people away from the man on the ground and then an officer appeared to fire at least one shot, hitting the man and prompting screams from bystanders. The man died at the scene, police said.
Government officials said the man, who has not been identified, had previously been convicted of an Islamist terrorism-related offense, according to British media reports. He had been in prison and was released on condition that he wear an electronic tag, according to several reports.
“It has been declared a terrorist incident," said Neil Basu, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. “I must stress, however, that we retain an open mind as to any motive."
There were reports that the man was wearing an explosive device, Basu said, but police determined that it was “a hoax explosive device."
“What's remarkable about the images we've seen is the breathtaking heroism of members of the public who literally ran toward danger, not knowing what confronted them," said Mayor Sadiq Khan of London. It is not clear if the passersby who intervened saw the hoax explosive device and tackled him anyway.
On Friday evening, police reported that two people died after being stabbed and that three others remained injured.
A few hours after the London stabbing, an assailant stabbed three people Friday night in a busy shopping district in The Hague, and police were searching for the suspect, authorities said.
A Dutch police spokeswoman said it was too early to establish a motive for that attack.
The victims, all minors, were released from the hospital late Friday. It was unclear whether they might have been hurt when the crowds of holiday shoppers panicked.
The stabbing happened about 7:45 p.m., when a man attacked several people on the street. Investigators were “keeping every scenario open," police spokeswoman Marije Kuiper said.
The Netherlands was shocked by a similar stabbing in Amsterdam a year ago, when two Americans were wounded in a knife attack that prosecutors say had a "terrorist motive."
In London, meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police said that around 2 p.m., they responded to reports of a knife attack in Fishmongers' Hall, a grand Greek Revival building that sits just at the north end of London Bridge and is often used for events. On Friday, a criminal justice group whose members are former Cambridge University academics was meeting there.
A woman who said she was in the hall described an almost surreal scene, posting on Twitter that after the attack began, a man grabbed a five-foot-long narwhal tusk from the wall and used it to confront the attacker.
Later, on the bridge, as the crowd was trying to subdue the assailant, bystanders captured images of a man standing with a long white pole, which the woman in the hall, Amy Coop, said was the narwhal tusk.
Videos posted on social media showed police vehicles blocking both sides of the roadway on London Bridge, one of the city's busiest arteries and a popular pedestrian crossing.
As police cordoned off the area, empty buses and abandoned vehicles remained parked on the bridge. In the nearby Borough Market, a food and drink space that is popular with tourists, visitors were told to shelter in place, before eventually being evacuated.
The incident bore a disquieting similarity to the 2017 attack on the bridge, in which a van careered onto the sidewalk, mowing down pedestrians, before three attackers leapt from the vehicle and struck people with knives. They killed eight people before being killed by police. Those men were also wearing fake suicide vests.
Earlier that year, a car plowed into pedestrians on nearby Westminster Bridge. Six people, including the attacker, were killed.
The 2017 London Bridge attack, which was carried out by three assailants inspired by the Islamic State group, came in the final weeks of Britain's last election, and it rapidly became a political issue. The Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, accused the prime minister at the time, Theresa May, of cutting the number of police officers in Britain.
The latest attack came only days before President Trump and other leaders are scheduled to visit the city for a NATO summit. On Tuesday, Queen Elizabeth II plans to hold a reception marking the alliance's 70th anniversary.
Those in the area around London Bridge described the panic in the moments after the attack.
Susan Vinn, 57, said that she had been outside her office shortly after 2 p.m., when she saw people running across the bridge and into her office lobby.
“It's horrible," she said of the attacks that have rattled London in recent years. “We know it's going to happen again, we just don't know when, so that keeps us worried for sure."

Texto completo: If the story of "Dark Waters" sounds familiar, to a certain extent it is. But this film is not business as usual, with the presence of director Todd Haynes and star Mark Ruffalo the key reasons why.
On the most basic level "Dark Waters" is a whistleblower story, the latest in a genre of doing-the-right-thing scenarios that includes such popular films as "Erin Brockovich," "The Insider" and even "All the President's Men."
Inspired by an article in the New York Times Magazine, "Dark Waters" could have simply followed the template of the story's upbeat headline, "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare," telling the story of attorney Robert Bilott, who worked for more than 20 years to expose decades of heedless environmental contamination dreadful enough to cost the chemical giant $670 million in fines.
Ruffalo, an actor with an activist bent, read that story and decided to star in a movie version, becoming lead producer and hiring Haynes, a director whose 1995 "Safe" was ecologically prescient, and a filmmaker who never does anything the expected way.
Working with screenwriters Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, Haynes has constructed a dark, edgy film, disturbing and meant to be, a real-life horror show that details the impunity with which DuPont put profits above the known harm its chemicals were causing.
"Dark Waters" also focuses on the wrenching, disconcerting consequences of doing the right thing, on the number of grinding years of unrelenting, life-changing pressure - more than 20 in this case - that were needed to even begin to make a difference.
One of the many ironies in this story is that Bilott was in almost all ways the least likely guy to become the environmental hero.
Yes, Bilott (played by Ruffalo) was an attorney, but the Cincinnati firm he worked for was old-school conservative to the core. Recently made a partner, his area of specialization was defending big corporations rather than suing them.
That all began to change on a day in 1998 when gruff and furious Wilbur Tennant (a brilliant Bill Camp), a farmer from Parkersburg, West Virginia, who was acquainted with Bilott's grandmother, made the trip to Cincinnati and insisted "I want a lawyer."
Though he's a new father and his wife, Sarah (an expert Anne Hathaway), is not sure why he's even bothering, Bilott feels compelled to take the drive to Parkersburg.
Tennant has both physical evidence and videotape recordings of the horrors that have been visited on his herd of cattle, 190 of which he has buried. Tennant feels that the damage is caused by the neighboring Dry Run Landfill, where the Washington Works factory operated by DuPont deposits its chemical waste.
Before making what he views as a friendly colleague-to-colleague request to a pal at DuPont, Bilott runs his plan past his superior, the buttoned down Tom Terp (Tim Robbins, expert as well).
Neither man has any idea of what they, and their firm, are getting into, though when a DuPont functionary warns Bilott that "you're flushing your career down the toilet," he starts to get the idea.
That's because, as the lawyer finds out, a chemical variously known as PFOA or C8 and essential to the manufacture of Teflon, is being released into the Parkersburg water supply.
Ruffalo is splendid at projecting the unusual combination of bred-in-the-bone idealism with mulish stubbornness that made it impossible for Bilott to walk away.

Texto completo: Our guide to plays and musicals coming to New York stages and a few last-chance picks of shows that are about to close. Our reviews of open shows are at nytimes.com/reviews/theater .
Previews & Openings
'THE ILLUSIONISTS -- MAGIC OF THE HOLIDAYS' at the Neil Simon Theater (previews start on Nov. 29; opens on Dec. 4). Christmas -- with its crowds, its commercialism, its obligations -- doesn't always feel like the most magical time of the year. Annually, a group of prestidigitators tries to change that. This year's sorcerous lineup includes the mind reader Chris Cox, the comic conjurer Paul Dabek and the close-up magician Eric Chien.
theillusionistslive.com
'JAGGED LITTLE PILL' at the Broadhurst Theater (in previews; opens on Dec. 5). This jukebox musical, inspired by Alanis Morissette's best-selling album, arrives unironically on Broadway. The story of a dysfunctional family, it is directed by Diane Paulus, with a book by Diablo Cody. Of last year's production in Massachusetts, Jesse Green wrote that it does the good work "we are always asking new musicals to do: the work of singing about real things." Will you fall head over feet? Don't be surprised.

'JUDGMENT DAY' at the Park Avenue Armory (previews start on Dec. 5; opens on Dec. 10). A different kind of trolley problem motors into the Park Avenue Armory. Christopher Shinn adapts Odon von Horvath's 1937 play, both a tense drama and a political allegory exploring guilt and responsibility. Luke Kirby ("The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel") stars; Richard Jones directs.
212-616-3930, armoryonpark.org
'KEEP' at St. Ann's Warehouse (previews start on Dec. 4; opens on Dec. 8). Diffident, aggressive, humane and often startlingly funny, the storyteller Daniel Kitson brings his new work to Brooklyn. In a show that sounds less like a monologue and more like a job for Marie Kondo, Kitson attempts a digressive catalog of the 20,000-some possessions in his home.
718-254-8779, stannswarehouse.org
Last Chance
'BETRAYAL' at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Harold Pinter's chronologically tricky and emotionally sticky love triangle leaves the stage. Ben Brantley described Jamie Lloyd's production, starring Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Cox and Zawe Ashton, as "the most merciless and empathic interpretation of this much performed work I've seen." He added, "I didn't expect it to be one of those rare shows I seem destined to think about forever."
212-239-6200, betrayalonbroadway.com
'THE GREAT SOCIETY' at the Vivian Beaumont Theater (closes on Nov. 30). The second of Robert Schenkkan's plays about the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson ends its term. Directed by Bill Rauch and starring Brian Cox, the drama incorporates Johnson's high and low moments, but it doesn't do much more. "A play that doesn't dramatize a man's interior landscape is just a pageant," Jesse Green wrote.
greatsocietybroadway.com
'THE MICHAELS' at the Public Theater (closes on Dec. 1). Richard Nelson's new play, the first of a planned cycle, clears its dinner table. A meal set in the home of a dying choreographer, this drama is even quieter than Nelson's other dramas set in Rhinebeck, N.Y., but Ben Brantley found it still as rich and "as hopeful as it is heartbreaking."
212-967-7555, publictheater.org
'THE ROSE TATTOO' at the American Airlines Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Tennessee Williams's sunstruck, Florida-set comedy of sex and grief ends its run. Though Ben Brantley had some encouraging words for its stars Marisa Tomei and Emun Elliott, he noted that "it's a vaudevillian notion of sex they're presenting, the poignancy and poetry within their characters' coming together are mostly absent."
212-719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org
'SCOTLAND, PA' at the Laura Pels Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater (closes on Dec. 8). Adam Gwon and Michael Mitnick's update of Shakespeare's "Macbeth," with '70s rock and a side of fries, places its final orders. Jesse Green noted that under Lonny Price's direction, it is not only funny, but also "quietly insightful, making piquant connections between Shakespeare's drama of political powerlust and the consumerist mania of our own fast-food culture."

Texto completo: A dive into Brett Kavanaugh's ascent to the Supreme Court, Jeff VanderMeer's new eco-horror novel, Ralph Ellison's letters and more.
'Alice Adams: Portrait of a Writer,' by Carol Sklenicka (Scribner, Dec. 3)
Adams rose to prominence with short stories, many published in The New Yorker, and novels like "Superior Women." Sklenicka, also the author of a skillful biography of Raymond Carver, connects broader societal themes (women's liberation, the civil rights movement) to Adams's development as a writer.
'Dead Astronauts,' by Jeff VanderMeer (MCD/FSG, Dec. 3)
Known for his Southern Reach trilogy, including "Annihilation," VanderMeer returns with an eco-horror novel set in a post-climate change future. Amid the nightmares that suffuse the narrative, VanderMeer has dreamed up some fantastical creatures: a messianic blue fox, a dangerously violent duck and an ancient fish with a secret.
'The Dolphin Letters, 1970-1979: Elizabeth Hardwick, Robert Lowell, and Their Circle,' edited by Saskia Hamilton (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Dec. 10)
These letters, which draw from the last years of Lowell's life, detail a profoundly creative time for the couple as well as the breakup of their marriage (and eventual reconciliation). Elizabeth Bishop, Adrienne Rich, Mary McCarthy and other friends make appearances; taken together, the correspondence offers a debate about the cultural role and legacy of art.
'One Long River of Song: Notes on Wonder for the Spiritual and Nonspiritual Alike,' by Brian Doyle (Little, Brown, Dec. 3)
When Doyle, the former editor of Portland magazine, died in 2017, he left behind a fervent fan base and a trove of well-loved books. If there's a guiding principle behind this posthumous collection, it's reverence -- for God, nature, his loved ones and more.
'The Sacrament,' by Olaf Olafsson (Ecco/HarperCollins, Dec. 3)
A young nun is sent to investigate claims of abuse at a school in Iceland, and while she is there, the headmaster dies under mysterious circumstances. Years later, a child who witnessed the death calls the nun back to Iceland, forcing her to revisit her past and the church's legacy of power.
'The Story of a Goat,' by Perumal Murugan (Black Cat/Grove Press, Dec. 10)
Murugan, one of India's best-known writers, tells the story of a rural community in the southern tip of the country. After a farmer in Tamil Nadu receives a small, frail black goat from a stranger, he and his wife are pleased to see the animal thrive. (The goat even narrates some passages of the book.) But as the goat grows up and encounters danger after danger, the story also becomes a political allegory.
'The Selected Letters of Ralph Ellison,' edited by John F. Callahan and Marc C. Conner (Random House, Dec. 3)
The correspondence in this prodigious collection will thrill scholars and fans alike. Editors' notes help contextualize the letters and amplify the themes of Ellison's life and writing. Readers have a ringside seat to the author's intellectual development and his close relationships with friends like Richard Wright, as well as his struggle to complete his masterpiece, "Invisible Man."
'Supreme Ambition: Brett Kavanaugh and the Conservative Takeover,' by Ruth Marcus (Simon & Schuster, Dec. 3)
Marcus, a Washington Post columnist and editor, examines how Kavanaugh's ascent dovetailed with Republicans' decades-long effort to form a majority on the court. She also seeks to answer the questions that linger about Kavanaugh's confirmation: Was Christine Blasey Ford, who testified that he had assaulted her, a credible witness? And what ramifications does Kavanaugh's appointment have for the future of the Supreme Court?
'This Is Happiness,' by Niall Williams (Bloomsbury, Dec. 3)
When readers meet Noel, the narrator of this luminous new novel, he's an older man reflecting on his adolescence in Faha, a small Irish village, in the 1950s. Back then, the town was preparing for the long-promised arrival of electricity while Noel grappled with his own romantic desires and the arrival of a stranger, Christy. This big-hearted story is an intimate study of a small place on the brink of change.

Texto completo: In books about the history of wives, the history of the breast and other subjects, she examined how cultural forces led over time to feminist thinking.
Marilyn Yalom, a prolific feminist author and cultural historian whose subjects included the history of women as partners in marriage as well as the history of the female breast, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 87.
Her son Reid Yalom said the cause was multiple myeloma.
Ms. Yalom was a professor of French language and literature in the mid-1970s, as the women's movement was gaining steam, when she segued into feminist scholarship at what is now Stanford University's Clayman Institute for Gender Research.
While she had already written a number of academic works, she did not start writing her more notable books until her late 50s. One of the first was "Maternity, Mortality, and the Literature of Madness" (1985), which suggests a link between madness and motherhood in some female writers, including Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf.
Her best-known works include "Blood Sisters: The French Revolution in Women's Memory" (1993), "A History of the Breast" (1997), "A History of the Wife" (2001), "Birth of the Chess Queen: A History" (2004) and "How the French Invented Love" (2012).
Ms. Yalom organized and hosted a Bay Area women writers' salon, where women found support and encouragement for their writing projects as well as practical advice about publishing.
"She admired the 18th-century French salon culture, where women played a leading role in organizing events of intellectual discourse," The Stanford News wrote in a tribute after her death. "She excelled in reinventing this dynamic for her fellow women scholars on campus and beyond, as well as in her Palo Alto home."
Throughout her career, Ms. Yalom was fascinated by the cultural forces that shaped women over time and led to feminist thinking.
In "A History of the Wife," she examined how marriage, considered a religious duty in medieval Europe, evolved into a sense of personal fulfillment in modern America.
In the process, she unearthed some disconcerting facts: In Rome, fathers negotiated the marriage of daughters as young as 6; in the Middle Ages, a husband had the legal right to beat his wife; and from the 1920s to the 1960s, housewives in the United States spent from 51 to 56 hours a week doing chores.
"No startling new insights here," Kirkus Review said in its review, "but a useful and refreshingly cheerful overview of women's changing roles in marriage and society."
In "A History of the Breast," Ms. Yalom looked at breasts through many different lenses, tracing how perceptions of them had changed, from objects of infant nurture to objects of erotic desire.
"Though breasts still carry an overload of cultural and sexual expectations," she wrote, "many women hope to see the day when their chests do not have to bear such a burden."
Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Natalie Angier called it "a fascinating cultural, political and artistic history of our most symbolically freighted body part."
In "The Birth of the Chess Queen: A History," Ms. Yalom traced the evolution of the queen in chess. When the game began in the sixth century in India and Persia, the queen did not exist. At her introduction in the 15th century, she had no power at all, and was able to move only one square at a time on the diagonal. Eventually, she became the most powerful piece on the chessboard -- a development that Ms. Yalom correlated with the rise of actual powerful queens in Europe.
"While there were few women rulers before the 15th century whose names can be definitely linked to the game," she wrote, "the reality of female rule was undoubtedly entwined with the emergence and evolution of the chess queen."
Alas, she wrote, the queen's power on the board has not inspired women to take up the game, noting that only 5 percent of the world's chess players were women.
Marilyn Koenick was born on March 10, 1932, in Chicago, the daughter of Samuel Koenick, a businessman, and Celia (Katz) Koenick. She grew up in Washington.
She graduated from Wellesley College in Massachusetts with a degree in French in 1954 and went on to earn a master of arts in teaching in French and German from Harvard in 1956 and a doctorate in comparative literature from Johns Hopkins University in 1963.
She met Irvin D. Yalom when the two were young teenagers in Washington. They married in 1954, and he went on to become a well-known psychiatrist and author whose notable books include "Love's Executioner: And Other Tales of Psychotherapy" (1989).
In addition to him and her son Reid, she is survived by two other sons, Victor and Ben; a daughter, Dr. Eve Yalom; eight grandchildren; and a sister, Lucille Joseph.
Ms. Yalom taught French at the University of Hawaii, in Manoa, where her husband was stationed with the Army. When he got a job teaching at Stanford Medical School, they moved to Palo Alto and she taught languages at California State University, Hayward (now California State University, East Bay).
In 1976, she joined Stanford's Institute for Research on Women and Gender -- now the Clayman Institute for Gender Research -- as a research scholar. She couldn't join the faculty because Stanford barred the hiring of spouses, although she later lectured at the university on gender studies and memoir writing.
Ms. Yalom played a major role in the institute's development, serving as its deputy director from 1976 to 1987, with a brief period in the 1984-85 academic year as director. In 1987 she became a senior scholar at the institute, where she initiated a visiting scholars program and organized annual conferences.
In their later years, she and her husband turned their attention to mortality. He wrote "Staring at the Sun: Overcoming the Terror of Death" (2008), and she wrote "The American Resting Place: 400 Years of History Through Our Cemeteries and Burial Grounds" (2008), with photographs by her son Reid.
In the last year, since Ms. Yalom learned she had cancer, she and her husband had begun a joint book about her illness and the process of dying.
She recently finished another book, "Innocent Witnesses: World War II Viewed by Children," about children's memories of the war. It is to be published next year.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump was briefed on the whistleblower complaint about his dealings with Ukraine before the White House released nearly $400 million in military aid to Kyiv, officials say, shedding new light on events that triggered the impeachment inquiry.
Trump was told about the complaint in late August in a briefing by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and John Eisenberg, an attorney with the White House National Security Council, according to two officials not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.
The lawyers told the president about the complaint, explaining that they were trying to determine whether they were legally required to give it to Congress, the officials said. The aid was released on Sept. 11 amid growing pressure from lawmakers.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House has claimed there was no link between the military aid suspension and the president’s request for Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his family.
But it was his request to Ukraine’s president in a July phone call that prompted the government whistleblower’s complaint about a link. The assertion of such a link has since been corroborated by a parade of witnessed testifying on Capitol Hill.
The August briefing with Trump was first reported by The New York Times.
The revelation comes days before the House Judiciary Committee takes over the impeachment probe, scheduling a hearing for next week as it pushes closer to a possible vote on charges of “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
The Judiciary panel scheduled the hearing as the Intelligence Committee on Tuesday released two last transcripts from its depositions, including from a White House budget official who detailed concerns among colleagues as Trump ordered them, through intermediaries, to put a hold on military aid to Ukraine.
Trump and his lawyers have been invited to attend the hearing and make a request to question witnesses, according to Democratic rules approved by the House last month. The committee released a letter from committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., to Trump, saying he hopes Trump will participate, “consistent with the rules of decorum and with the solemn nature of the work before us.”
The White House said Wednesday no decision had been made whether to send a representative.
Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus reaffirmed in a statement the U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. She urged Russia to begin the process of peacefully restoring Ukraine’s full sovereignty over areas in Eastern Ukraine that have been the scene of fighting between Russian-backed rebels and Ukraine forces since 2014.
Trump tweeted an image of his head superimposed on the muscular body of a champion boxer. He regularly tells his supporters at campaign rallies and in videos that Democrats are “trying to stop me because I’m fighting for you and I’ll never let that happen.”
Multiple government witnesses testified in impeachment hearings held by the Intelligence panel this month that Trump directed his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani to take the lead on Ukraine policy and that Giuliani pushed an “irregular” diplomatic channel.
The Intelligence Committee is wrapping up its investigative phase of the probe and preparing its report for the next. Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has said the report could be released soon after the House returns from its Thanksgiving break.
The initial Judiciary hearing on Dec. 4, the day after lawmakers return, will feature legal experts who will examine questions of constitutional grounds as the panel decides whether to write articles of impeachment against Trump.
Democrats are aiming for a final House vote by Christmas, which would set the stage for a likely Senate trial in January.

Texto completo: Kerry Kennedy chides a Times article for "overlooking Nestlé's repeated failure to eradicate exploitation in its production of chocolate."
To the Editor:
In "Can a Company Be Virtuous and Profitable?" (Sunday Business, Nov. 17), The Times examines how Nestlé, the world's largest food company, is attempting to prove environmental sustainability and boost revenues at the same time. But the article has a major blind spot -- overlooking Nestlé's repeated failure to eradicate exploitation in its production of chocolate.
Approximately two-thirds of the world's cocoa supply comes from West Africa, where, according to the Department of Labor, over two million children are exploited as child laborers and slaves. The world's biggest chocolate companies have repeatedly missed deadlines to eliminate child labor from their cocoa supply chains, a report this past summer found.
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights is teaching students how to take action -- by writing letters to company chief executives, urging them to protect their fellow children, and by educating their friends and neighbors by handing out fair trade chocolates and fact sheets about labor practices. The students have learned that injustice often envelops the chocolate bars and treats that they eat.
When we focus on sustainability, we need to care as much about the labor force.
Kerry Kennedy
New York

Texto completo: Here's an idea for Thanksgiving. Put down that phone. That's right. Put down that phone.
Courtesy of David Leonhardt, New York Times columnist, comes the thought that if we travel over the river and through the woods to grandma's house, only to spend precious family time gazing at a screen, we might as well stay home. He has a point. In his family, there is a move to put away phones not just for family holidays, but to enjoy a screen sabbatical once a week, a Tech Shabbat. The idea, he said, was popularized by filmmaker Tiffany Shlain.
Leonhardt writes that, "This week, Americans will endure flight delays, traffic jams and other logistical miseries to spend time with family and friends. And when the holiday weekend is ending, many will lament that they don't get to spend enough time with those relatives and friends.
"But during the weekend itself, these same lamenters will spend a lot of time ignoring the people around them and distractedly staring into their phones."
Instead, why not put away technology and interact on a personal, not technological level? He challenges people to put up their phones for a full 24 hours and makes this bold claim: "I predict you'll be surprised by how much you'll like it."
Considering how many people have only cellphones, with no landline at their homes, turning off the phone completely might be difficult. How else will Aunt Sue call for directions or Dad remind his son-in-law to pick up ice along the way? Phones are not just for distraction; they are the means for people to communicate with the wider world, and in many families, the only means.
However, Leonhardt's broader point is wise. On Thanksgiving, the holiday designed to draw family and friends around a shared table, the togetherness is reduced when people are not actually present in the moment.
We can use modern technology, enjoy the ability to catch up on news, play a game or read the latest thriller without sacrificing our personal moments with the people we love. The key is restoring balance.
Leonhardt again, talking about his family's respite from technology: "I wasn't sure whether I'd like it, I'll admit, and our kids were even less sure.
"But it was wonderful. We hung out with friends, without distraction. We never had to ask, guiltily, 'Sorry, what'd you say?' because we had been only semi-listening. ... It felt productive, rejuvenating and, yes, fun."
Who doesn't enjoy fun? Who doesn't want a Thanksgiving filled with sharing, the giving of thanks and creating special memories that help bind families together through the decades? Make that happen. This Thanksgiving, put down the phone.

Texto completo: Southern California has always had a special place in the heart of Trevor Noah. The 35-year-old South African writer, producer, comedian, political commentator, actor and current host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” first cut his teeth in some of the area’s smaller comedy clubs and theaters.
After starting out in 100 to 300-capacity rooms, Noah graduated to 1,000 to 3,000-capacity theaters and eventually worked his way up to selling out the 8,000-capacity Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa in 2018. His latest stand-up outing, dubbed The Loud & Clear Tour, is now playing out in arenas across the country and Noah will return to Southern California to headline Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles Friday, Dec. 6.
“I’ve been lucky that California has been one of the places where I’ve had a lot of support from the days of having like a really tiny following,” Noah said during a recent interview as he was also in the midst of taping “The Daily Show” back in New York. “It has been a really wonderful, sort of gradual celebration that just keeps growing. That’s the only way I can look at this show (at Staples Center) because otherwise it becomes overwhelming and you start worrying too much about the size of the show as opposed to the quality of the show.”
Despite hosting a television show where the primary topic is to analyze and report on politics, Noah said that’s not what his comedy show is. He’s said in previous interviews that he doesn’t talk about those things, including the President of the United States, so specifically but speaks rather generally when it comes to getting political.
“The live comedy audience has always been more diverse and also more broad in their taste,” he said. “‘The Daily Show’ is obviously a show based around politics and news and not everybody wants to live in that world, which I completely understand. But when it comes to stand-up, I’ve been really lucky. I have Republicans come to my shows and they’ll say ‘Hey, I love your stand-up … I don’t like your political views, but I love coming to your stand-up shows.’ That’s fine with me. I don’t think we have to agree with each other on everything, but I like that we can still all laugh together as people. I’ve always enjoyed that people of all ages, all religions, ethnicities and politics affiliations come to the shows. I want you to have fun whether you come with your mom and dad, boyfriend or girlfriend, your siblings, your friends … I just want you to have a good time. It’s not a show designed for one specific person, it’s designed for everybody.”
Doing the stand-up tour gives Noah a break from the 24/7 news cycle and all the commotion and breaking news that comes with ongoing impeachment hearings and the ramping up of yet another election year.
“It is a nice break and I think people should take that break in life, too,” he said. “People always ask me, ‘How do you cope with Trump all the time?’ It’s not healthy and I only deal with it during the day while making a show that’s 30 minutes long. If you engage in politics for 30 minutes a day, that’s more than enough to get all of the information you need since most of it is repetitive anyway. You don’t have to live in it and I try not to. I understand how important it is to our world and I give it the attention it deserves, but I also make sure to go live my life as a human being, too.”
On top of working on his stand-up material, Noah said he also listens to a lot of music. Nothing specific at the moment, but he said he’s a sucker for a good playlist on Spotify or Tidal. He picked up and is currently reading the new Prince biography, “The Beautiful Ones,” which was released in late October. He also said that if he had to choose between either being on “The Masked Singer” or “Dancing With the Stars,” he’d pick “The Masked Singer.”
“Because I’d be covered the entire time and my embarrassment is limited to when I have to take my mask off,” he said with a laugh. “I don’t think people would know it was me based on how badly or how well I could sing, which is nice.”
Noah has already accomplished a lot in his lifetime. He’s obviously got a successful stand-up career and daily TV show, but his book “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood,” became a New York Times Bestseller and his “Son of Patricia” special and album is nominated in the best comedy category at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Jan. 26 at Staples Center.
“I live a very strange life in that I’ve never been too worried about the distant future,” Noah said. “I just try to focus on what I’m doing now and try to do it to the best of my ability and I found that serves me well. Right now, all I’m focused on is the Loud & Clear Tour and ‘The Daily Show,’ just making sure I put together a great show on TV every night and making sure that the stand-up is a world-class comedy experience. Once that’s all done, I’ll focus on the next thing. The last thing I want to do is start focusing too far into the future and tripping on the thing that’s right in front of me.”

Texto completo: Rudy Giuliani pursued business agreements with Ukrainian officials this year as he sought dirt on President Trump's political rivals.
None of the deals were closed, but multiple reports Wednesday showed Giuliani stood to gain hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ukrainian clients as Trump directed U.S. diplomats to work with the former New York City mayor on Ukraine issues.
In one case, Giuliani, 75, got as far as drafting a retainer agreement in February with Yuri Lutsenko, Ukraine’s former prosecutor general, who was fired from his position in August. The draft would have called for Lutsenko to retain Giuliani's firm, Giuliani Partners, and husband-and-wife legal team Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing, for $200,000 to help recover assets he claimed were stolen from the Ukrainian government.
In another proposal in March, the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice would retain Giuliani Partners, as well as diGenova and Toensing, and pay $300,000 to Giuliani's firm. Other draft retainer agreements involved diGenova and Toensing but did not mention Giuliani.
Giuliani told the New York Times that he rejected a proposal by a Ukrainian official, but considered for a month a deal with the Ukrainian government before rejecting it. “I thought that would be too complicated,” Giuliani said. “I never received a penny.”
Mark Corallo, a spokesman for diGenova and Toensing, said the pair had agreed to represent people they consider to be "Ukrainian whistleblowers," but the business proposals were "unaccepted."
There has been a growing consensus among regional analysts that Lutsenko, who earned the distrust of local anti-corruption activists during his three years in office, lured Trump's personal lawyer into a rash pursuit of dirt on Democrats that could bring the American president down. Giualiani was working with Lutsenko, 54, to convince Ukraine to announce investigations into corruption involving former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter’s ties to an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch and the 2016 election.
House Democrats are speeding ahead with impeachment proceedings looking into Trump allegedly pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into his political rivals by holding out on delivering nearly $400 million in security aid, which was released in September, and a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. A transcript of a July 25 phone call shows Trump suggesting his Ukrainian counterpart talk to Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr.
In an interview with the publication Ukrainian Truth this month, Lutsenko said he was in talks with advisers for Giuliani about setting up a meeting with Barr. "In the end, they said the meeting would be impossible unless I hired a company that would lobby for such a meeting," he said, adding that he declined the terms.
The Justice Department has also distanced itself from Giuliani’s actions.
Impeachment witnesses have testified that Giuliani has been involved in "shadow diplomacy" while pushing Ukrainian officials to look into Democratic rivals. Giuliani also appears to have played an influential role in Trump’s decision to recall U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, and witnesses have suggested that Lutsenko was advocating for her removal.
Giuliani, along with two of his associates, is now under investigation by the FBI and the Southern District of New York for possibly influencing U.S. government decisions at the behest of Ukrainians. Giuliani has not been accused of wrongdoing and claims he did not need to register as a foreign agent because he was working on behalf of his client, Trump.
Trump denied sending Giuliani to Ukraine to seek out damaging information on his political rivals, telling former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly on Tuesday, "No, I didn't direct him, but he's a warrior."
Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested in October on charges related to campaign finance violations. Both men have pleaded not guilty. Parnas, however, has signaled his willingness to cooperate in the impeachment process. Authorities issued subpoenas seeking information related to more than a half-dozen crimes as part of their investigation into Giuliani’s consulting firm.

The political apology in the race for president

Texto completo: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg suddenly feels regret - just in time for his run for president. As mayor of New York for 12 years, Mr. Bloomberg oversaw an aggressive, tough-on-crime, stop-and-frisk policy that disproportionately targeted African Americans and Latinos. And for that he is sorry.
That wasn't his story a few months ago. Before he decided to jump in the race to unseat President Donald Trump, Mr. Bloomberg was not a fan of admitting wrong and maligned an apology culture in politics. He mocked presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden and former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke for bowing to pressure: Mr. Biden for an "apology tour" after criticism of a crime bill some believe led to the mass incarceration of black men, and Mr. O'Rourke for apologizing for his white privilege.
Yet, there was Mr. Bloomberg a couple of weeks ago standing before a congregation at an African-American megachurch in Brooklyn seeking mercy. He had not yet announced his run for president, but the rumors were strong that he was. Despite trash talking his now political rival Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg needs the African American vote, which accounts for about a fifth of Democrats.
A more than decade-long police state against brown people is not a good look. At the height of his stop and frisk program, police stopped 575,000 people under the policy and African American and Latinos were stopped the most according to The New York Times. Police made about 685,000 stops in 2011 and 87% were African American or Latino. It was bound to come up during the election and Mr. Bloomberg obviously sought to head it off early. Else, he runs the chance of looking like Mr. Trump, who has praised such policies throughout his term.
Voters are holding candidates accountable for their past actions, but they shouldn't stop their scrutiny at these apologies of convenience. Candidates need to prove their case beyond words. If not, people should show their displeasure at the ballot.
We have seen the consequences of indiscriminate arrests in Baltimore, which is dealing with a population of people with criminal records who can't get jobs. The issue came up when former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley made a bid for president. Some say it was one factor that hurt his chances. If Mr. Bloomberg doesn't want to end up in the same predicament and really wants to prove he's sorry, he needs to lay out policies to improve the lives of people hurt by his choices. Critics are already looking skeptically at his attempt at atonement and have questioned the timing. Many of those caught up in the arrests probably weren't given the same benefit of the doubt for their indiscretions and mistakes.
Like with the other candidates in the race, we predict Mr. Bloomberg won't be able to brush off such an issue that has morphed into an indictment of the fairness of the justice system. Mr. Biden learned the consequences of his past when his healthy lead slowly diminished after a few guffaws he at first tried to ignore about his role as author of the now highly polarized crime bill. Mr. Biden also appeared to praise the civility of segregationist senators he worked with in the past. A reply two weeks after the outcry for took too long to come for some people and was far too tepid for others.
"Now, was I wrong a few weeks ago to somehow give the impression to people that I was praising those men who I successfully opposed time and again?" he said. "Yes, I was. I regret it. I'm sorry for any of the pain and misconception I may have caused anybody."
Candidate Pete Buttigieg has tried to improve his reputation with African Americans with an 18-page platform of policy and reforms that would benefit those voters. He pledged to fund HBCUs in a recent op-ed in The Sun.
Unfortunately for Mr. Buttigieg, a good majority of African Americans aren't buying his spiel, including those in South Bend, Indiana where he is mayor. Too many residents there say he didn't have a handle on injustices against blacks in the police department and economic racial inequalities that persist in the city.
Time will tell if Mr. Bloomberg's speech was enough to shield him enough from criticism not to hurt his presidential bid. Or if people will see through his apology.

Texto completo: An Iowa cancer treatment startup blames U.S.-China trade tensions for blocking a key investment.
In a letter to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Immortagen Inc. co-founder Kristi Thiel said a Chinese investor can't send a promised $2.7 million to the Coralville company because of tensions between the United States and China. The authority, which loaned Immortagen $100,000 in March 2017, unanimously voted Friday to let the company suspend payments because of the investment stuck across the Pacific Ocean.
Thiel, who did not return multiple calls or emails seeking comment, wrote to the Authority on Oct. 29 that the unnamed Chinese investor's money was supposed to fund the company through 2020. She said Immortagen received awards for two trials that it will complete by the end of next year.
"Both of these trial awards are outside validation that our technology is unique and of high interest," Thiel wrote. "Because of the issue with our current investor, we have been forced to reduce expenses and seek additional investments, and as such, operating capital is at a premium. It is critically important that we focus all resources to be able to conduct both of the critical trials mentioned."
Founded by four University of Iowa researchers in 2014, Immortagen plans to use genetic information from cancer patients' tumors to tell doctors which treatments will be most effective.
In her letter, Thiel wrote that the Chinese investor previously sent $300,000 to Immortagen, but the promised $2.7 million was delayed "because of the current trade issues." She did not provide details.
Economic Development Authority Compliance Manager Paul Stueckradt said Friday he did not know specifically why the Chinese investor had not been able to get money to the company.
Authority spokeswoman Jacque Matsen said the company was up to date on payments prior to Thiel's request. In an email to the Register, she wrote that members of the authority "thoroughly reviewed confidential financial records from Immortagen, Inc. and conferred with the company in making its recommendation."
The $2.7 million would almost triple the amount of money Immortagen has received. In her letter, Thiel wrote that the company secured more than $1 million through October, including $500,000 from Des Moines venture capitalist John Pappajohn.
Pappajohn said Monday that Thiel told him the Chinese government had blocked further investment.
"I think it's a lot to do with Trump and our negotiations," he said. "It's political. It's all a political game."
In July, The New York Times reported that Chinese investment in the United States had fallen almost 90% since President Donald Trump took office. Citing data from Rhodium Group, an economic research firm, the Times reported that Chinese investors pumped $46.5 billion into U.S. companies in 2016. Chinese investment fell to $5.4 billion in 2018.
Trump campaigned on taking a tough stance against China's trade practices, such as its requirement that U.S. companies doing business in China share intellectual property information with Chinese partners. The two sides have escalated tariffs on one another's imports since Trump took office in January 2017. He announced in October that the U.S. and China were close to a "phase one" trade agreement, but the two sides have not shown signs of progress since then.
The Times' report cited four main reasons for the drop in investment. The Chinese economy has slowed down since Trump took office, and the Chinese government has exercised stricter control over investments going to the United States.
At the same time, tariffs soured some relationships among businesses in both countries. U.S. regulators also received broader authority in 2018 to block foreign investment in domestic companies.
Anson Soderbery, a Purdue University economics professor who studies international trade, said details behind blocked investments like the one involving Immortagen are often difficult to parse. The Chinese government is not exactly forthcoming about how it regulates its investors, he said.
"It's kind of crazy where we are today," he said. "I wouldn't put anything past the current situation. .... When China is involved, it's hard to put your finger on what's going on."

How Russia Sought to Blame the Messenger

Texto completo: A World Anti-Doping Agency report outlines how Russia fabricated evidence to try to discredit a whistle-blower.
In the years since a whistle-blower implicated Russia in one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports history, the country has made repeated efforts to discredit him. Last year, Russia officials took that campaign one step further: They planted fabricated messages that they later claimed were written by the whistle-blower in a database that they had agreed to turn over to investigators from the World Anti-Doping Agency.
The effort appeared to have several goals, according to a report compiled by the antidoping agency's intelligence and investigations unit and obtained by The New York Times: to frame the whistle-blower as the ringleader in a scheme to extort athletes and coaches by threatening to manipulate doping samples; to provide cover for the manipulations of test results within the data set; and to help Russia avoid serious penalties from global antidoping regulators.
The problem for Russia is that the investigators quickly uncovered the fabrications and the altered test results. And now Russian sports is facing its biggest crisis to date.
On Monday, WADA confirmed that the committee charged with investigating and monitoring Russia compliance with global antidoping rules had recommended barring the country from all international sporting events, including next year's Olympics in Tokyo, for four years. WADA's executive board will consider the committee's recommendation when it meets for a special session on Dec. 9 in Paris. It is expected to agree with the findings.
If Russia is barred, the country can appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, sport's highest court, and its athletes most likely will be allowed to petition to compete as individuals. A similar situation existed at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games, where Russians deemed to have clean doping records were allowed to compete as neutrals, and the Russian anthem and flag were barred.
To Travis Tygart, the chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, such a repeat would be unacceptable. On Tuesday, he called for a blanket ban on Russian participation, something the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, has publicly opposed.
"History has taught us the response to Russian doping used in Rio 2016 and Pyeongchang 2018 -- in which a secretly managed process permitted Russians to compete -- did not work," Tygart said in a statement. "The world's athletes saw through this charade, and it apparently only emboldened Russia to simply destroy evidence and to tamper with more samples to make it impossible to confirm whether any clean Russian athletes actually exist."
To clear Russia this time, antidoping regulators or a tribunal at CAS would have to overrule evidence of manipulation and rule-breaking so brazen that, according to the secret report, some of it occurred even as investigators were traveling to the Moscow laboratory to retrieve the data.
The fabricated messages implicating the Russian whistle-blower, Grigory Rodchenkov, were a part of a database known as the Moscow Data that Russia turned over to antidoping officials as part of a deal that allowed Russia to return to most international sports competitions in 2018. But based on details revealed in a close reading of its dozens of pages, which have not been made public, investigators quickly determined that the fabricated messages were inserted into the electronic records of Russia's antidoping agency more than two years after Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's antidoping laboratory, had fled the country.
Further scrutiny of the database revealed a massive data manipulation effort to conceal failed drug tests by an unknown number of Russian athletes.
"The fabricated, modified and deleted Forum Messages are a stunning deception," investigators wrote in the report. "They are the figurative 'smoking gun.'
"Moreover, their existence demonstrates intent and provides a lens through which the totality of manipulations within the Moscow Data should be observed."
Margarita Pakhnotskaya, deputy director general of Russia's antidoping agency, RUSADA, said the organization would wait until a final decision on a possible ban from world sports was made before deciding whether to appeal. The multiyear ban, which would have implications for Russian sports far beyond the Olympic Games, fulfilled a prediction made by RUSADA's current chief, Yuri Ganus, who for weeks had called on Russian authorities to come clean about manipulations in the data.
The report lays out attempts at a cover-up lacking any subtlety and efforts by Russia to portray Rodchenkov as a criminal mastermind eager to enrich himself.
"We need to tell him straight and clearly, that we are creating the appearance of dirty samples, and the athletes and their trainers are bringing us bonuses," one message supposedly sent to Rodchenkov reads. Another, which was altered to make Rodchenkov the sender, had its text replaced to read: "Treat all the files using the scheme, and you can take your Bonus home."
"Russia must think the world is completely stupid if they thought anyone would believe their ham-handed fabrications," said Jim Walden, Rodchenkov's American lawyer. "When the full story is revealed, Russia's desperate efforts to continue to falsely blame Dr. Rodchenkov will be fully exposed."
While fake messages supposedly from Rodchenkov were added, others were deleted, including several from Evgeny Kudryavtsev, an official who had been responsible for ensuring that the biological samples of Russian athletes competing overseas were clean.
Eighteen of 25 messages deleted from the database relate to Kudryavtsev, according to investigators. In a signed affidavit provided to a separate International Olympic Committee investigation, Rodchenkov said Kudryavtsev was directly involved in sample swapping -- replacing dirty urine samples with clean ones -- at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
Investigators also found evidence that on Jan. 6, four days before the WADA team was finally allowed access to the laboratory, 15,325 files and folders containing the "most relevant antidoping data" had been deleted.
Much of the data that remained simply did not add up.
WADA came to some of its conclusions by comparing the Russia-supplied data with the information in a database of athlete samples from the Moscow laboratory that it received from Rodchenkov in 2017. In those samples, analyzed between January 2012 and August 2015, investigators identified 578 suspicious samples from 298 athletes. Investigators hoped the secrets in the files that Moscow turned over would provide conclusive evidence of cheating.
In almost every case, though, the Moscow Data had been altered, either to remove any trace of failed drug tests or to alter the concentrations of prohibited substances to a level lower than the threshold for a positive result.
The report concluded that the first evidence of laboratory data being altered dated to 2016, the year Rodchenkov went public with revelations about how he had helped Russia perfect a system to cover up failed tests by its athletes.
But the majority of changes, the report says, occurred after September 2018, when Russian officials realized the consequences of their agreement to open data from the Moscow laboratory to WADA scrutiny. Until then, officials had rejected all requests from WADA to enter the laboratory, claiming since 2016 that the facility had been declared a "crime scene" under the supervision of state authorities investigating Rodchenkov.
Jonathan Taylor, the head of the WADA committee responsible for overseeing Russian compliance and for producing the report that the board will consider, wrote that his committee did not know who gave the instructions to alter and delete the Moscow Data or to plant fabricated messages in it to try to falsely incriminate Rodchenkov, who now lives in the United States.
But, Taylor wrote, the "Moscow laboratory was at all relevant times under the authority and control of the Russian Ministry of Sport and/or the Russian Investigative Committee." Each, he wrote, was well aware of the need to protect the integrity of the database.

Texto completo: A poll showed Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, would win a primary for a Long Island congressional seat by more than 30 points.
In some Republican circles, the notion of President Trump's children running for political office is not only a parlor game -- it's a matter of finding the right opportunity for the right Trump.
Could that opportunity exist in blue New York? And could it happen now?
Some state Republicans are eager to give it a try. With Representative Peter King, a Republican, not seeking re-election on Long Island next year, the circumstance may never be better for a younger Trump to run.
But which one?
Donald Trump Jr., the president's elder son and the member of the family who is most naturally fluent in the language of the Republican base, has frequently been mentioned as a possible candidate for office.
He attracts a younger contingent of Republicans to events, organizers say, and has demonstrated his ability to raise big money for congressional candidates on Long Island.
Lara Trump, who is married to the president's son Eric, is a senior adviser on the president's re-election campaign; her potential for future office has also been mentioned by some close to the family.
"Among Republican voters, Trump is still a magic name," Mr. King said in a telephone interview. "I've been with Don Jr. several times on Long Island. Was with Lara once at a fund-raising event. She handles herself very well. She's good with people."
The buzz around a potential junior Trump candidacy heightened last week, when a poll surfaced in New York that showed Lara Trump winning by more than 30 points in a hypothetical Republican primary for Mr. King's seat.
The poll, conducted this month and paid for by an influential conservative anti-tax group, the Club for Growth, was picked up by the right-wing site, Breitbart, and quickly gained steam.
"Word spread rapidly about the poll," said John Jay LaValle, the former chair of the Suffolk County Republican Party and a Trump surrogate in 2016. "I have not heard one person say a negative thing about it."
David McIntosh, the president of Club for Growth, acknowledged that Ms. Trump had nothing to do with the poll; he said the committee's intent was to show Ms. Trump how popular she was in order to lure her into the open race.
Ms. Trump hails from North Carolina and now lives in Manhattan. She is not currently a candidate on Long Island, or anywhere else.
"We often do that to test people who we think would be a good candidate," Mr. McIntosh said of including her in the survey, which the group said cost about $ 3,000.
Ms. Trump declared herself "incredibly honored" by the results of the poll but uninterested in running.
For now.
"While I would never close the door on anything in the future, right now I am focused on winning a second term for President Trump," Ms. Trump said in a statement.
The poll might have been a lark. Or perhaps it was a way for Club for Growth, staunchly opposed to Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, to ingratiate itself to the president and his supporters. (The group is backing his re-election.)
Some local Republicans saw it as a bit of political score-settling in the way it showed Ms. Trump soundly besting the only other named candidate, Rick Lazio, a former Long Island congressman. Mr. McIntosh called the moderate Mr. Lazio a "repeat loser," but added: "I like Rick Lazio. There's no personal animosity there."
Asked about the poll, Mr. Lazio said in an email that "to the best of my knowledge I have never met Lara Trump," and added that he had "no knowledge as to whether she has ever lived in, been employed in and has had a meaningful involvement with the people of the Second Congressional District."
Whatever the reason for the survey, it underscored the popularity of the Trumps, particularly on Long Island.
The children are popular among party activists in New York, so much so that Republican fund-raisers practically swoon over the idea of getting one of them to headline an event. Donald Trump Jr., has been particularly prolific and lucrative, making several trips this year to Long Island.
"They've been extremely helpful to the local party," Mr. LaValle said of the president's family. "They're certainly a known commodity here."
They come frequently for social and political events, Mr. LaValle said, including on Thursday night, when Donald Trump Jr. headlined a fund-raiser for Representative Lee Zeldin, a Republican who represents eastern Suffolk County.
The event, at a St. James, N.Y., catering hall, drew more than 350 people and raised more than $ 200,000 for Mr. Zeldin's re-election, according to his campaign.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly been floated by supporters as a potential future candidate for president, and, much less realistically, for New York City mayor, a tall order given the city's strong Democratic base and its intense dislike for the president.
"Listen, I don't ever rule anything out," Mr. Trump said on "CBS This Morning" this month when asked about his political future. He declined to comment for this article.
A year earlier, he told The New York Times that he loved "the intensity of campaigning," but admitted that he was less sure how much he "would love aspects of the actual job."
The fund-raiser on Thursday appeared to be at least the third time that Mr. Trump helped raise money for Mr. Zeldin, who has risen to party prominence as a vocal defender of the president and his family.
"Nobody, other than the president himself, brings more star power, excitement and energy than members of the Trump family," Nick Langworthy, the state Republican Party chairman, said in a statement. "It's a special phenomenon that no other president has enjoyed, outside of maybe the Kennedys."
At the same time, the political window for Lara Trump or any other Trump relative to run in a place like Long Island may be closing. Democrats now outnumber Republicans among registered voters, making gains in both Nassau and Suffolk Counties.
And the Trump name is almost equally galvanizing among Democrats as it is magnetic among Republicans, and a local race involving one of them could draw big money from activist donors from both parties.
"There's real solid support and real solid opposition" to the president, Mr. King said of his district. "A tremendous amount of anti-Trump energy."
Ms. Trump could win, he said. "At the very least it would be very competitive."

Texto completo: Jane Fonda was about to spend the night in jail.
But it wasn't 2019, and it wasn't for protesting U.S. policy on climate change " something Fonda has done every Friday in Washington since early October. It was the 1970s, and 32-year-old Fonda " in the throes of a professional, personal and ideological rebirth " had just been booked in a Cleveland jail on trumped-up charges of drug smuggling.
Later, an officer told her that orders for her arrest came straight from the Nixon White House. Displeased by her anti-Vietnam War activism, the FBI and CIA had been surveilling her for months. The National Security Agency was tapping her phone calls.
Fonda knew none of that Nov.-3, 1970. But as she posed for a mug shot " her dark hair cropped close, with shaggy bangs " she raised one fist in defiance anyway.
The grainy black-and-white image shaped a generation of female activists.
'At the time, there was this expectation that the only way a woman could be in public was to present herself in full makeup, respectably dressed, a skirt, a well-controlled girdle,' said Kirsten Swinth, a Fordham University professor who studies U.S. women's history. The mug shot 'says you can be something different than what society has told you you can be.'
It also marked the beginning of a hairdo sensation. The photo introduced the United States to bad-girl bangs " and Fonda's appearance in the 1971 crime thriller 'Klute ,' sporting the same haircut, launched the look into the cultural stratosphere.
Women across the country " some men, too " began asking their hairdressers for variations of the 'Klute cut.' It continues to inspire hairstyles on fashion runways almost 50 years later.
Fonda, who was unavailable for an interview, is well aware of the staying power of the mug shot. On her personal website, she sells sweatshirts, hoodies, T-shirts, tanks and coffee mugs emblazoned with the picture (and dedicates all proceeds to the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power and Potential).
As Fonda told the Los Angeles Times in 2018: 'I sure got a lot of mileage out of that arrest.'
Her path to the Cleveland jail began months before the booking, when she decided to visit then-husband Roger Vadim's hairdresser in New York City. Her marriage to the French director and movie producer was falling apart " he drank, gambled and cheated " and she was working to rediscover herself as a person and an actress, 'prob[ing] deeper into the character and into myself than I had before,' Fonda wrote in her autobiography, 'My Life So Far.'
Seeking radical change, she told stylist Paul McGregor, 'Do something.' He did. McGregor sheared off her long blond locks, dyed the strands 'darker, like what it really was' and left a jagged, imperfect, impudent fringe.
'Hair had ruled me for many years . . . the men in my life liked it long and blond,' Fonda wrote. But now 'I looked like me! I knew right away that I could do life differently with this hair.'
A few months after that, she ended her marriage. She agreed to play spunky call girl Bree Daniels in 'Klute,' a role different from anything she had acted before. And she began pouring herself into various activist movements, especially the protests against the Vietnam War.
Fonda started calling herself a 'feminist' in public and ditched her old wardrobe. While married to Vadim, she had favored 'ultrashort miniskirts, revealing blouses, and makeup . . . all designed to attract men's attention,' Fonda wrote in her autobiography. Now she opted for jeans, 'drip-dry' T-shirts and army boots.
'The activism upon which I embarked in 1970 changed me forever in terms of how I saw the world and my place in it,' Fonda wrote. Part of that meant refusing to 'look the way I was supposed to anymore.'
By rejecting a 'hypersexualized image' of herself, historian Swinth said, Fonda acted out a powerful strand of feminist rebellion that was just beginning to emerge at the time.
'That's part of the Jane Fonda story, that flip from the sex kitten image to the powerful activist woman,' Swinth said. 'In that sense, it's spot on to think of her as a model of a new feminist outlook.'
Equipped with her new hairdo, new wardrobe and newfound commitment to social justice, Fonda had just landed in Ohio after delivering an anti-Vietnam War speech in Canada when airport officials demanded " without explanation " to open and search her luggage.
Rummaging around, authorities found small plastic vitamin bottles and concluded they must be illegal drugs. Two 'hulking FBI chaps' imprisoned Fonda in a room for three hours, she wrote, refusing to let her phone a lawyer or even rise from her chair.
After a while, 'desperate' to use the restroom, Fonda tried to push aside an agent blocking her way and was promptly arrested for assaulting an officer, as well as drug smuggling. Authorities handcuffed the actress, took her to the Cuyahoga County jail, fingerprinted her, snapped a mug shot " then passed out of history.
'I was in a cell for ten hours . . . the next day I was brought from jail in handcuffs past a phalanx of TV cameras and photographers,' Fonda wrote. 'As my hands are slender and double-jointed, I easily slipped out of one handcuff and threw a 'power to the people' fist in the air, much to the chagrin of the guards.'
Fonda was released on bonds totaling roughly $5,500, and all charges were later dropped. The day after she appeared in court, Fonda was 'back on the lecture circuit,' she wrote.
She would not spend another night behind bars until almost half a century later, when Fonda slept in a D.C. jail after police arrested her for demonstrating against climate change on Capitol Hill in early November this year. The 81-year-old actress was released the next day when the government declined to press charges. Undeterred, Fonda told The Washington Post she plans to keep protesting every Friday through early January.
These days, Fonda's hair is blond again " still short, less shaggy. Police did not publish a booking photo this time around. Still, the 1970 mug shot may have a 21st-century successor.
Week after week, arrest after arrest, the winterberry-red coat Fonda wears to every protest has gained fame of its own. As the chief fashion critic of the New York Times concluded last month, the coat 'has made that rare but historically significant leap from garment to symbol: of a time, place and movement.'

Suicides by K-Pop stars prompt soul-searching in South Korea

Texto completo: Seoul, South Korea • When K-pop star Sulli ended her own life last month, her fellow K-pop singer Goo Hara was heartbroken, bidding a farewell to her best friend in a livestreaming video. With tears running down her cheeks, Goo expressed hope that Sulli would live “as she pleases” in heaven.
“I will live twice more diligently now that you are gone,” she said. “Dear fans, I will be fine. Don’t worry about me.”
But Sunday, six weeks after Sulli’s death, Goo herself was found dead in her Seoul home in what police were calling a suicide. The suicides by two of K-pop’s most beloved stars have left fans in South Korea soul-searching over what has gone wrong in K-pop, their country’s most successful cultural export.
Lee Yong-pyo, chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, told reporters that Goo’s body was found by a maid Sunday evening. Investigators also found a handwritten memo in which Goo expressed her despair, Lee said.
As grief-stricken fans flocked to the Seoul hospital where her body lay, her family was planning to hold the funeral in private.
Once popular mainly just in Asian countries, K-pop girl groups and boy bands, like BTS, now command huge global followings. The genre has captured the imagination of fans around the world with its fusion of synthesized songs, video art, fashionable outfits and synchronized dance routines that mix teasing sexuality with doe-eyed innocence.
But entertainment industry experts have long warned about the dark side of the scandal-ridden K-pop industry, which has remained largely hidden behind its glamour.
Legions of young South Koreans train for years, often starting in their early teens, honing their singing skills and dance moves in hopes of impressing “star management” agencies who deem them good enough to debut their first song. Even after they make the cut to become K-pop idols, their star status rarely lasts long, as younger stars with cuter looks and fancier dance moves replace them. K-pop stars in their late 20s are already considered old, and these fading idols often try to carve out new roles in acting or as solo singers or talk-show regulars — a difficult transition that is often not successful.
The K-pop phenomenon gets disseminated largely through YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and other social media channels, where its stars are exposed to both a flood of fan letters and hateful comments and cyberbullying on everything from their looks to their singing skills to their private lives.
“From an early age, they live a mechanical life, going through a spartan training regimen,” said Lee Hark-joon, a South Korean journalist who has produced a TV documentary on the making of a K-pop girl group and co-wrote the book “K-pop Idols: Popular Culture and the Emergence of the Korean Music Industry.” “They seldom have a chance to develop a normal school life or normal social relationships as their peers do.”
“Their fall can be as sudden and as dramatic as their rise to the height of fame,” and all at a young age, Lee added. “Theirs is a profession especially vulnerable to psychological distress — they are scrutinized on social media around the clock, and fake news about their private lives is spread instantly.”
In 2017, Sulli, a former member of the South Korean girl group f(x), attended a memorial for another K-pop star, Kim Jong-hyun, 27, who had killed himself after leaving a note that said he was consumed by depression.
Sulli, 25, took her own life last month after she bitterly complained about misogynistic internet trolls, especially after she joined a feminist campaign that advocated not wearing bras.
Goo, 28, a former member of the wildly popular K-pop girl group Kara, had also struggled with online attacks. Trolls spread rumors that she owed her looks largely to plastic surgery. She admitted that she had gone under the knife for droopy eyes.
Things turned worse for her after she broke up with her hair-designer boyfriend, Choi Jong-beom. And rumors spread that there was video footage of the couple engaging in sex.
“I won’t be lenient on these vicious commentaries any more,” Goo wrote on her Instagram account in June, complaining about her “mental health” problems and “depression.” (After her death, such posts on her Instagram account were removed.)
At times, she sounded desperate, pleading for her critics to relent.
“Is there no one out there with a beautiful mind who can embrace people who suffer?” she pleaded.
“Public entertainers like myself don’t have it easy — we have our private lives more scrutinized than anyone else and we suffer the kind of pain we cannot even discuss with our family and friends,” she said. “Can you please ask yourself what kind of person you are before you post a vicious comment online?”
The situation with her ex-boyfriend, Choi, became particularly contentious. She sued him last year, accusing him of threatening to spread the footage of them having sex. In August, he was sentenced to 18 months in prison on charges of blackmailing, coercion and inflicting bodily harm against Goo. But his jail term was suspended by the court, keeping him free.
Goo’s suicide has already resulted in soul-searching in South Korea. The number of people who supported an online petition to the office of President Moon Jae-in asking for harsher punishment for sexual harassment has more than doubled to 217,000 since her suicide was reported.
In her last Instagram message, Goo uploaded a photo of her lying on her bed. She wrote “Jalja,” or “sleep tight.”

Texto completo: The woks have gone cold. Bamboo House Chinese restaurant joins the list of local eateries that have closed.
Located on Sixth Avenue in Midtown, the buffet restaurant offered a culinary passport to Chinese and Taiwanese dishes rich in flavor and made with locally sourced ingredients.
The restaurant closed for good sometime last week, although the exact day hasn't been confirmed.
For years, the restaurant posted in its front window a copy of a New York Times travel story on Tallahassee, in which it got a mention.
Bamboo House hasn't posted on its own Facebook page for roughly five years. Tallahassee Table, a local food-based blog, posted on its own Facebook page about the restaurant's closing.
"Sad to say that the longtime Chinese restaurant, Bamboo House, on Sixth Street off Monroe Street, has closed," the post said.
"The number has been discontinued and the place is dark with stuff on the floor. Robert Alexander Lee, chef of (next door) Ology Brewing Company's new food truck, said he saw equipment being hauled away Nov. 19."
The local food scene has sustained several closings this year that include restaurants like Aura Restaurant and Bar downtown, A La Provence in Market Square and Merv's Melt Shop in the Gaines Street District.

Texto completo: "I care not who casts the votes of a nation, provided I can count them," a New York Times editorial quipped in 1880.
The editorial was poking fun at imperialism. Nevertheless, the old quote strikes at the heart of a new debate about the Electoral College – to say nothing of recent news headlines.
Everyone seems pretty certain that one or the other political party is interfering in U.S. presidential elections.
In the midst of so much turmoil and distrust, why would some Americans want to give even more power over elections to the federal government? Yet Electoral College opponents advocate for it, seemingly without realizing what they are doing.
Make no mistake: If the Electoral College is eliminated, the powers of incumbent presidents and their administrations will be vastly increased.
Democrats who are working to end the Electoral College should stop and think about that statement again: They do not trust Donald Trump. Yet they are working to give him more power over his own reelection and the election of his successor.
The Electoral College is, at its heart, a decentralized, state-by-state presidential election process. States determine the logistics of Election Day, access to the ballot, recounts and other, similar issues. Meanwhile, the federal government must take a back seat because the Constitution gives the national government only a limited role to play at election time.
Notably, while the Constitution grants Congress some authority in elections, the executive branch is left out in the cold: Presidents have no direct power over their own reelections.
Consider how things would change if the country were to eliminate the Electoral College and move to a single, national presidential election instead. A federal government that once played a secondary role would now sit in the driver's seat. All election matters would be subject to federal control. Such changes would be necessary because of the altered nature of the election: Instead of 51 statewide election pools, in which each state and Washington, D.C., selects its own electors, American voters would all be thrown into a single national election pool.
A new federal election code and bureaucracy would be needed to ensure that voters are being treated equally, even across state lines. It is easy to imagine a new Department of Elections to oversee the administration of the federal election code and a president appointing someone to run it. Presidents who chose to run for a second term would enjoy a nice luxury: The person in charge of their reelection would also be a person beholden to them for a job as Secretary of Elections.
Americans are already worried that institutions such as the FBI or the State Department are being used inappropriately. Perhaps they are, and such abuse of our institutions should be addressed. Yet how much easier would it be for an incumbent class of federal officials to legally influence election outcomes if a Department of Elections and a U.S. Election Code were in charge of every aspect of presidential elections?
How fortunate that the Founders created something different, ensuring that checks and balances exist even within our presidential election system. No incumbent has too much authority over his own reelection. He can't rig the system by pushing for federal regulations that tip the scales in his own favor.
This is a healthy state of affairs.
Electoral College opponents blast the system as outdated, archaic and unnecessary, but their criticisms reflect a misunderstanding of the Founders' objectives as they drafted our Constitution.
The Founders sought to create a constitutional structure that would allow Americans to be self-governing, despite the imperfections of human nature. They knew that people can be selfish, greedy and too ambitious. They knew that power corrupts. Their constitutional system of checks and balances – including the state-by-state presidential election process – was designed to protect against these human flaws.
Efforts to eliminate the Electoral College fly in the face of this history. They would place unchecked power in the hands of a few.
Americans deserve better.

UBER'S OPERATING LICENSE IN LONDON NOT RENEWEd
London's transport authorities on Monday announced they will not renew Uber's license to operate in the British capital after thousands of trips were made with someone other than the booked driver. Transport for London said there were "several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk." Uber's license expired at midnight Monday. The company said it will appeal the decision, which it has successfully done in London once before. It can continue to operate until a final decision is made.

CHARLES SCHWAB TO ACQUIRE TD AMERITRADE
Charles Schwab will acquire TD Ameritrade in a $26 billion, all-stock deal. The tie-up of the brokerage companies, which helped revolutionize stock trading by making it affordable and easy for the masses, reflects the shift from a commission-heavy revenue stream to one more reliant on interest income and other client services. The combined company is expected to serve 24 million brokerage accounts, overseeing more than $5 trillion in client assets.
ICAHN TO SEEK CONTROL OF OCCIDENTAL'S BOARD

Texto completo: From Thanksgiving turkey to Bay Area bagels, Mr. López-Alt discussed a variety of topics on Reddit.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
J. Kenji López-Alt is a California-based chef, recipe tester, restaurateur and food writer. He recently joined The New York Times Food desk, for which he writes a monthly column that uses the science of cooking to help readers in the kitchen. His recent revelations include the magic of mayo on the grill and the perfect way to boil an egg. On Monday, Mr. López-Alt participated in an "Ask Me Anything" session on the website Reddit. A condensed and edited version of that exchange appears below.
Is there a real benefit to depositing herb butter underneath the turkey's skin?
It depends if you want butter and herb flavor under the skin or not. There is definitely an advantage to rubbing a little salt under there, at least as far as moisture retention goes. Butter I never do, I find it mostly just runs out and makes it difficult to brown the turkey evenly. Herbs under the skin can be good, but again, I don't see a huge advantage over putting them on the surface or adding them to the gravy. There are lots of ways to get flavor into turkey.
How does a meat's inner temperature keep rising after its taken off heat?
Easiest to think of it in a very simplified way. Imagine your meat is like a Combo, where the delicious cheese center is at one temperature, while the crunchy pretzel outer layer is at a higher temperature. Let it sit out and some of the heat energy from the pretzel layer will dissipate out into the room (most of it, in fact), but some of it will be transferred to the cheesy center, raising its temperature. Same thing happens with a roasted piece of meat, it's just that the temperature gradient inside is smooth rather than stepped.
Is there a way to translate the heat levels on gas-burning stoves (low, medium, high)?
There's unfortunately no good answer to that question, but it's definitely NOT a matter of translating to degrees. Degrees measure temperature, which is a material-dependent measure, i.e., a thick cast pan at 400 degrees Fahrenheit holds a lot more energy than a thin aluminum pan at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. High/medium/low are measures of energy flux, not of temperature. They tell you how much energy is going into the pan (which roughly correlates to how much is going into the food). This is not an easy thing to measure with home equipment, so the real answer is you just need to pay attention to the visual, auditory and olfactory cues you get as you cook. Like most things it comes down to practice to get really good at it.
What advice do you have for someone who want s to write their own cookbook?
It really depends why you want to do it. If your goal is a career, then you need to think of the book as a business. Book proposals are written like business plans. You need to identify your market, see what the competition is in the space, calculate how many books you think you can sell, work on building a platform to sell them and promote them. Without good prospects on all of those things, a publisher is not going to go for your book. The actual content of the book is also important, of course, but the platform and business side of it are equally so.
Find what makes your writing uniquely you, and make sure you figure out how to use that voice to your advantage. This is very, very difficult to do, but you do it by just writing all the time. Every day, every chance, whether it's for public consumption or just for practice. You need to practice to get good at anything. No different with writing.
Why aren't their good bagels in the Bay Area?
Same reason it's hard to find great barbecue in New York. Mostly it comes down to a dining and baking population that was not raised knowing what a "good" bagel is. Without a frame of reference, you can't really tell what is good or bad. So bad bagels do just fine because they still taste good for many people, even if they don't taste the way a bagel "should" taste.
Not that there's anything wrong with that. People should eat what they like, even if it's some jalapeño and cheese-covered monstrosity with blueberry cream cheese. Who am I to judge?

Bloomberg's China-friendly history could be a liability for his 2020 candidacy

Texto completo: It remains to be seen whether Democratic voters will embrace Mike Bloomberg-now that he is officially a-2020 candidate. But his late entry should be welcome news to Chinese leaders.-
The billionaire and former New York City mayor is likely the field's most Beijing-friendly candidate. He has-argued-against the U.S.-China trade war, maintained investments in China, hosted-a conference there and frequently speaks-up on behalf of its regime. His approach has drawn criticism from conservatives " but it also represents a vulnerability in a Democratic race that has embraced a more confrontational posture toward the Chinese government.-
It's an issue Bloomberg is wrestling with in real time. Just last week, as he prepared to jump into the race, he canceled a planned appearance in Beijing at the New Economy Forum, a conference hosted by his company, Bloomberg LP, and attended by top Chinese officials.-
He tapped former treasury secretary Hank Paulson to open the event in his stead. 'My good friend Michael Bloomberg asked Henry Kissinger and me to represent him here today, because, as you all know, he's made a decision to serve his country,'-Paulson said, name-checking the former secretary of state who has long worked to promote ties between the United States and China.-
Bloomberg's view of China's authoritarian government has elicited closer scrutiny since he began signaling an interest in a bid he'd sworn off earlier this year. In particular, he faced blowback for defending Chinese President Xi Jinping in a September interview with PBS's 'Firing Line.' 'The Communist Party wants to stay in power in China, and they listen to the public,' Bloomberg said on the show. 'Xi Jinping is not a dictator. He has to satisfy his constituents or he's not going to survive.'
Pressed by host Margaret Hoover on whether he really believes Xi is not a dictator, Bloomberg emphasized his point. 'No, he has a constituency to answer to,' Bloomberg said. 'No government survives without the will of the majority of its people, okay? The Chinese Communist Party looks at Russia and they look for where the Communist Party is, and they don't find it anymore. And they don't want that to happen. So, they really are responsive.'-
The claim flies in the face of a spate of Chinese crackdowns, including the forcing of more than a million Muslim Uighurs into detention camps and the use of live rounds and tear gas-on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.-
The exchange prompted Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin to write-that Bloomberg's 'record on China shows he is the wrong person to guide our country in confronting this historic challenge.'
Rogin went on to detail Bloomberg's extensive financial interest in the country:
'Bloomberg LP doesn't make money in China only by selling terminals. Through its massive Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index, Bloomberg LP is helping finance Chinese companies by sending billions of U.S. investor dollars into the Chinese bond market.-
'This year, the index-began a 20-month-plan to support 364 Chinese firms by directing an estimated $150 billion into their bond offerings, including 159 controlled directly by the Chinese government. Bloomberg, along with other Wall Street firms, is effectively supporting the Chinese government's efforts to resist the U.S. government's economic pressure, while exposing American investors to increased risk.'
Rogin argued there is nothing inherently wrong with Bloomberg's business activities in China " it is, after all, a common practice on Wall Street. 'But if Bloomberg really believes what he says, his misreading of the Chinese government's character and ambitions could be devastating for U.S. national security and foreign policy,' he wrote. 'He would be advocating for a naive policy of engagement and wishful thinking that has already been tried and failed.'
Bloomberg's accommodating approach to China has extended to his media company.
Bloomberg News in 2013 killed news stories that could have angered Chinese leaders, the New York Times reported. The outlet's top editor at the time denied the story.-
As President Trump ramped up his trade war with Beijing last year, the former mayor called for another path forward.-Speaking at Bloomberg's New York headquarters at a conference co-hosted by China General U.S. Chamber of Commerce USA, he said the United States and China must 'find ways to work together. Other countries around the world, again, including China, are responding with their tariffs, and we don't need a trade war.'-
The other Democratic contenders have staked out a range of positions on China. But the consensus in the field holds that the United States needs to confront Chinese trading abuses. That view reflects popular opinion, which has turned heavily unfavorable toward China.-

Texto completo: Remember Samuel Insull? Probably not. Most people alive today don’t, but Insull’s life and the politics after his demise reveal some clues about where we’re headed today. Born in Britain to a modest family, Insull gained a position at Thomas Edison’s British operations and would later immigrate to the United States to become Edison’s personal assistant.
After moving his way up in the company, he would become head of Chicago Edison. Insull transformed Chicago Edison into one of the largest electric power companies in the United States, employing 6,000 people and serving 500,000 customers.
Despite his success, Insull would see the company he built collapse around him as a result of Black Thursday, where the stock market crashed, one the first signs of the looming Great Depression. With angry investors and consequences that trickled down to thousands of workers, compounded by indictments, Insull became the poster boy for excessive capitalism and greed. At the time, Franklin Roosevelt assured the public that he would "get the Insulls" of the world to set an example for those of unfettered greed.
The case of Insull and other tycoons like him led to mass regulation and expansion of government authority to prevent future disasters caused by men like him. Big government became the solution to addressing the shortcomings of the marketplace, and its reign would last for decades.
Today, we find ourselves in a different, yet similar predicament, where arguments for a return to big government don’t pertain to unfettered markets, but unfettered wealth. They are borne out of the same belief that big government and over-regulation is the only tool to correct course, regardless of any unintended consequences.
Fast forward to 2019, where Democratic candidates Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are running not against unfettered markets as Roosevelt did, but on what they deem unbridled wealth. They, too, seek to expand government through schemes such as a wealth tax and redistributive policies to control what they view as excess wealth. They invoke phrases such as the "ultra-rich," "the 1%," and "super-rich" to invoke anger among their supporters and the general public, attempting to change our notions and ideas of success.
“I don’t think that billionaires should exist,” said Bernie Sanders, further invoking his idea of a country where the government dictates what is success and how much of it any single person can have. This new wave of progressive Democrats argues that income inequality has become too widespread and rampant. They argue that some people have accumulated too much wealth — ignoring many people accumulated wealth through innovative ideas, running a great business, or maintaining a great business and brand passed down by a relative. None of this matters because to them, success can only be measured by government and only by expanding government authority can it be stopped and redistributed.
Americans gave $410.2 billion dollars to charity in 2017, most of which came from the wealthiest and most successful among us. They ignore that more than a dozen billionaires have joined Bill and Melinda Gates' "Giving Pledge" to give more than half of their wealth away to philanthropic causes — joining 154 other billionaires from around the world who have agreed to do the same. They ignore these facts because then it becomes easier to pit one group against the other.
Their objective is simple: limit how much you can have, and then they decide how it is divvied up.
Just imagine someone doing that to you. Imagine someone saying you have earned too much, so they’re going to take half of it away and give it out to the rest of us — regardless of whatever good you have done or plan to continue to do. Wouldn’t you be mad? Wouldn’t that be a cause for concern? If not, it should be, because where does it stop? It will only be a matter of time before they lower the threshold of who they deem too rich, and at some point, it might be you.
An example illustrated by the New York Times shows that if Elizabeth Warren’s “wealth tax had been in effect since 1982, for example, [Bill] Gates, who had made his first billion dollars by 1987, would have had $13.9 billion in 2018 instead of $97 billion. Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person, would have had $48.8 billion last year instead of $160 billion. And Michael Bloomberg, who is considering running for president himself, would have had $12.3 billion instead of $51.8 billion.” Warren’s plan calls for a 2% wealth tax on wealth over $50 million and 3% on wealth over $1 billion. Bernie’s plan starts with households and individuals with $32 million or more.
Despite what they may argue as good intentions, they ignore the deleterious impact this will have on communities of color, such as African Americans and Hispanics.
For example, out of the 14 million African Americans in the United States, less than 720,000 African American households have a million dollars or more in wealth, and that number shrinks significantly when discussing black billionaires (there are only five). The numbers are far worse for Hispanics, and while there are Latin American billionaires, there isn’t a single one who was born in the United States. The number of Hispanic households with a million dollars or more is comparable to that of African-Americans.
Minority billionaires such as Oprah Winfrey (who is known for her philanthropic work), Robert F. Smith (who gained notoriety for paying the student loans of the Morehouse College graduating class of 2019), or Jay-Z (who grew up in the Marcy projects of New York) would not only see their wealth dissipate, but would lose their billionaire status and as a result decrease their philanthropic giving, which are most valuable in the black community. This also doesn’t account for minority millionaires who would also see their wealth destroyed. The consequences alone should be enough to give us all concern.
What is being proposed is the greatest economic restructuring of wealth in the history of the United States and the world — and the unintended consequences will cause far more harm than good. Former Secretary of the Treasury and president of Harvard Larry Summers wrote in the Washington Post that, “Warren’s plan will discourage hiring, particularly of low-skilled workers, by firms that currently provide generous benefits. These firms will face the most burdensome taxes when they increase hiring and will gain the greatest cost savings by laying off workers.”
Expanding the scope of government to decide how much a person can have and what to do with what they shouldn’t have is not the role of government. Individuals are more than capable of deciding on their own the best ways to use their wealth to make differences. They’ve already done it, continue to do it, and there’s no need for government meddling to further it. There are alarming consequences that will disproportionately harm minorities who have gained a sliver of success and will undoubtedly make it more challenging for others to do the same.
It would behoove us all to be cautious of the purported good that Sanders, Warren, and others of the Democratic liberal movement purport. The consequences both known and unknown far outweigh their claims of good, and that should be enough to scare us all. Let’s not forget that sincerity is a dangerous and much-overrated virtue.

Susan E. Rice: The lessons of impeachment. They aren’t all depressing.

Texto completo: After two weeks of compelling testimony in the House impeachment inquiry, it’s worth weighing what has emerged. Four conclusions stand out.
First, there is now overwhelming testimony and evidence that affirm the deeply troubling revelation contained in President Trump’s summary of his “perfect” July 25 phone call with the newly elected president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Trump withheld an important Oval Office meeting and nearly $400 million in urgently needed military assistance from Ukraine to compel Mr. Zelensky to open, or at least announce, two investigations — one that would seek to exonerate Russia and dishonestly implicate Ukraine in interference in the 2016 election, and another that aimed to tar former Vice President Joe Biden with false corruption charges in relation to his work on Ukraine during the Obama administration.
Both of the long-sought investigations were based on manufactured and discredited allegations, and both served only one purpose: to advantage Mr. Trump politically. It is clear that Mr. Trump abused his power to extort bogus dirt on his chief rival for personal political gain.
Some allies of the president have insisted that this is no big deal because the United States routinely leverages White House meetings and assistance to obtain concessions from foreign governments. Yet, they fail to acknowledge that such leverage is properly used only to advance American policy objectives — not to service the personal interests of any individual, including the president. Thus, when Vice President Biden threatened to hold back economic assistance unless a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor was removed, he was acting in support of bipartisan American, European and International Monetary Fund policy to curb official corruption in Ukraine. Mr. Biden did it openly, transparently and not, as Mr. Trump has falsely claimed, to protect his son Hunter.
Second, these hearings have amply demonstrated the extraordinary caliber and character of our nonpartisan career Foreign Service officers, civil servants and uniformed military personnel. The intellect, integrity, selflessness and sense of duty displayed by each of the officials who testified — even in the face of harsh personal attacks and efforts at witness intimidation orchestrated by the president — are extraordinary. They reflect the commitment to country that I witnessed every day for 16 years when I was privileged to serve alongside these kinds of apolitical officers.
Yet Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress have denigrated and demeaned these public servants, placing them in physical danger — just because they prioritized their duty to the law and the Constitution above slavish devotion to any president. Beyond this disgrace, the president and his acolytes are assassinating the collective character of all career public servants — disparaging them as the “Deep State,” “Never-Trumpers” and un-American.
In rhetoric that recalls the darkest days of McCarthyism, Republican leaders will seemingly stop at nothing to destroy public faith in our public servants. This is the very “deconstruction of the administrative state” that Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, heralded as the administration’s goal. And who wins when the State Department, intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the Pentagon struggle to attract and retain top talent? Not Americans. It serves only our adversaries who want to hollow out our bureaucracy, weaken our national institutions and discredit our democratic model.
Third, it is now abundantly apparent that most Republicans in Congress have abandoned all semblance of serving the national interest. Their desperate resort to distortions, discredited conspiracy theories and blatant lies to distract from damning facts that implicate President Trump has replaced any pretense of performing their duties. From attacking the press to smearing witnesses and refusing to engage in congressional oversight responsibilities, the Republican Party has sacrificed its principles and traditions to preserve its political power — at the expense of our country.
Our separation of powers, the guard rail of our Constitution, fails when half the legislative branch abdicates its duty to hold the executive branch accountable. The cost of this failure will endure long beyond this presidency and is already signaling that our democracy is not only diminished but also increasingly dysfunctional.
And last, as Fiona Hill ably testified on Thursday, the primary beneficiary of our domestic dysfunction and divisions is President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Republicans in Congress are spouting Russian-sponsored conspiracy theories that disparage Ukraine and obscure Russian interference in our democracy. President Trump consistently takes actions with respect to NATO, Ukraine, Syria and elsewhere that accrue to Russian rather than American interests.
While Americans spew venom at one another, Russia is working overtime to pour salt into our wounds. Using social media every day to inflame distrust, fear and hate, Russia is pitting Americans against one another by fueling extremes on both sides of every divisive issue, whether race, immigration or guns.
Mr. Putin seeks to dismantle democracy and destroy America’s standing as a global leader. The only question is whether we will allow him to succeed.

Texto completo: The compliance and review committee for the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) recommended a four-year sports ban for Russia that would keep the country from representing its flag in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Games and 2022 Beijing Winter Games, according to a letter sent to the organization's board obtained by The New York Times.
Russia is still facing punishment for a doping and cheating scheme by its athletes, coaches and officials during the 2014 Sochi Games. WADA investigators discovered that Russian team officials erased urine test results from a database submitted to anti-doping regulators.
The committee's recommended ban, proposed in a report headed by British lawyer Jonathan Taylor, is similar to the one Russia faced during the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games when Russian athletes competed as neutral athletes. Under regulations adopted in 2018, WADA now has the authority to hand down punishment to Russia. The country also faces being barred from global sporting events such as the 2022 World Cup and the proposed ban also means the country would not be allowed to host any major international event.
WADA’s executive committee will consider the recommendations on Dec. 9. The nation has the option to appeal any sanction to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
A public statement released by WADA on the matter read; "This recommendation is accompanied by strong proposed consequences and the conditions of reinstatement. "
Last week International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach said, "our principle is that the guilty ones must be punished as hard as possible and the innocent ones must be protected. "

Trump EPA's cynical 'transparency' ploy would set back pollution science and public health

Texto completo: In a proposed rule published over a year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency indicated that in the future, when computing how pollution causes health damages, EPA would only be willing to use scientific results from studies where all the underlying data could be made public. Hundreds of leading scientists sent comments explaining in technical detail why doing that would be a very bad idea — and would preclude the use of some of the best science in setting environmental standards.
This month it began to look like the EPA may be blowing off all that scientific advice. In a revised proposed rule obtained by The New York Times, not only did the agency appear to ignored all the scientific advice it had received, it proposed to apply this approach in setting standards for all areas of pollution control and to go back and use it to reassess past standards. Doing that would be a bold and unconscionable political move to dramatically loosen a large number of standards that over the past several decades have been making America's air and water safer for all of us.
Health records vital to research
Very, very small particles in our air are killing thousands of Americans every year. These invisible submicron killer particles are less than . 00004 of an inch in diameter. We are unaware as we breathe them in, but they are so small that they can pass deep into our lungs where they lodge and over the years cause heart, respiratory and other diseases that kill us years earlier than we would die if we were not breathing them. Research by my colleagues and others shows that each year, at least 75,000 and perhaps as many as 100,000 of us will not live to fully enjoy watching our children and grandchildren grow up.
How do we know this? The answer is through years of good careful science that combines measurements of air pollution with sophisticated statistical analysis of health records. Many of those health records are for individual people, so when they have done their studies scientists have taken care to get proper permission to use the data, while guaranteeing that the privacy of the people whose records they have used will be protected.
Because the results that show early deaths are so striking, over the years there have been a number of independent assessments in which groups like the non-profit Health Effects Institute have gotten protected access to these sensitive data so they could check the analysis. These independent studies have confirmed the results.
Most submicron particles are created in the atmosphere by chemical reactions among a variety of common air pollutants. To protect people's health from this invisible killer, we need to control those pollutants. Over the last few decades, the United States has been making excellent progress in doing that.
Bipartisan plea: Don't stop the fight against mercury pollution: Republican and Democrat to Trump EPA
Reducing air pollutants is far cheaper than caring for all the health damage caused by small submicron particles. But the cost of pollution control is obvious, while the link between air pollution and health damages is not visible for all of us to see. For years there have been people who have been attacking the science because they didn't want to spend money on air pollution control. To roll back controls, they have chosen to attack the science.
Pitting science against transparency
Because they know we all favor "transparency," they have adopted a cynical strategy — forbid the use of any science in setting standards that is not open and transparent. I say "a cynical strategy" because these people know that, because of privacy, the underlying personal medical data from many studies cannot be made public. Doing that would be illegal under federal medical privacy law.
Don't punish clean-air progress: Donald Trump pollutes America with California scheming
In the past, environmental protection has not been a partisan issue. EPA was created by a Republican president, Richard Nixon. When I was chair of EPA's Science Advisory Board during Republican President George W. Bush's administration, the agency cared deeply about getting the science right.
It is time to call a halt to ignoring science in the interests of serving the political and economic interests of a few at the expense of the health of all Americans. It is time to return to a bipartisan approach to environmental protection that is based on the best science.

Auschwitz exhibit in NYC is a powerful reminder op-ed

Texto completo: From the mountains of shoes that were worn by Jews when they were packed into railroad freight cars bound for Auschwitz, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust displays one: a woman's red dress pump with a three-inch heel. It prompts viewers to wonder: Where did she think she was going?
Perhaps she did not have time to think when she was swept into the vortex of one of Europe's innumerable roundups. She was destined for the unimaginable, where she probably vanished quickly: 900,000 of the 1.3 million people sent there were murdered shortly after their arrival.
The New York Times of January 28, 1945, reported on its front page the Red Army's arrival the day before at Auschwitz, which the story described, in its 16th paragraph, as a place where more than a million "persons" were murdered. Persons. Of them, 1 million were Jews.
A yellowed Times edition from that date is displayed today in the museum, which is located on Manhattan's southern tip, near the spot where, in 1654, 23 Jews who had come from Spain and Portugal, via Brazil, became the first Jews in what was then New Amsterdam. The museum's six-sided Core building evokes the six-pointed star of David, and the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, which is the subject of a shattering exhibit, "Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away." The eloquence of the artifacts, which were first seen when the exhibit opened in Madrid and will be seen elsewhere in North America, is welcome testimony, in an age obsessed with new media, to the power of an old medium: the museum.
The exhibit includes Reinhard Heydrich's gift for Hermann Goering on his 47th birthday. Before Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942, he was the "architect of the Final Solution." His gift was a piece of parchment: the original 1551 proclamation, signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, requiring Jews to attach to their garments a yellow circle. The seeds of the Holocaust germinated for centuries in Europe's social soil. They did not, however, have to come to their cataclysmic fruition.
Other artifacts include Heinrich Himmler's handwriting in his annotated first edition of "Mein Kampf." And a photo of Anne Frank's parents' wedding. And a child's shoe with a sock carefully tucked into it, waiting for the child to put it back on after the "shower" to which he had been directed, from which he did not return.
Did you know that eight of the 15 participants in the Jan. 20, 1942, Wannsee Conference, which finalized plans for the industrialization of murder, had doctoral degrees? Education is not necessarily an inoculation against evil. Only two participants were older than 50: Genocide was a project for up-and-comers, idealists who acquired the ideals from socialization under totalitarianism.
The exhibit includes grainy, black-and-white film of a passing freight train shedding notes the way a tree shed leaves in autumn, notes tossed from between the freight cars' slats by the human cargo who were desperate to scatter random traces of themselves before the final darkness. One was tossed from a train leaving Holland by 17-year-old Hertha Aussen: "Most likely this will be the last card you will receive from me." Three days later she was murdered on arrival at Auschwitz.
What also died at Auschwitz is - was - what is known as the Whig theory of history, which holds, or held, that there is an inevitable unfolding of history in the direction of expanding liberty under law. Just as the Holocaust was not inevitable, neither is the triumph of enlightenment: History is not a ratchet that clicks only one way. Today, in several parts of the world, including on the dark, churned and bloody ground of central Europe, there are various forms of political regression. These are marked by a recrudescence of the blood-and-soil tribalism of degenerate nationalism, accompanied by thinly veiled, or not at all veiled, antisemitism.
Visitors entering "Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away" immediately walk past these words of Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor: "It happened, therefore it can happen again." Today in China's far west, concentration camps hold more than a million people who Beijing says show "symptoms" of being "infected" with the "virus" of "unhealthy thoughts." Similar medical terminology presented the Holocaust as social hygiene.
Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.

Texto completo: The Northwest Cultural Council is excited to announce its current exhibit that honors one of America’s outstanding modern poets, Mary Oliver.
The exhibit at Arlington Green Executive Center is comprised of single works by 17 of the council’s artists. Each artist has selected one of Oliver’s poems as inspiration for their piece. The poem is displayed adjacent to each work and will be read aloud during a reception for the artists Dec. 7.
In addition to Oliver’s work, two original poems by council artists are on display. The exhibit will run through Jan. 4.
Mary Oliver was born in Ohio in 1935 and spent her adult life in New England, then in Florida, where she died in January of this year.
From a young age, she immersed herself in nature and was quoted as saying, "When it’s over, I want to say: ‘All my life/I was a bride married to amazement. I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms.’" Her first collection of poems was published in 1963, when she was 28. Oliver received numerous awards and recognition throughout her life. In 2007, The New York Times described her as "far and away, this country’s best-selling poet."
This exhibit contains photography, stained glass, watercolor, oil and acrylic painting, as well as bas-relief sculpture. Participating artists include Mary Blinn, Steve Bogaerts, Joe Burlini, Cheryl Calderon, Dean Caminiti, Robert R. Cobb, Roger Gates, John Green, James Hojnacki, Karen Meadows, Moon Ja Park, Linda Nye, Lynnea Semasko, Gary Swiontek, Tom Warnke, Nancy Wedow and Tiffany Whisler.
Through the generosity of one of the council’s ongoing sponsors, RF Wittmeyer, Ltd., the public is invited to a reception with refreshments from noon to 3 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 7. Some of the artists will have gift items for sale.
There is ample free parking at Arlington Green Executive Center, 2101 S. Arlington Heights Road, Arlington Heights.

Educación para romper barreras

Texto completo: Así como lo vemos en otros ámbitos, los distritos escolares se están convirtiendo en espacios de gran diversidad étnica. Es decir, en una bella amalgama de niños procedentes de todas las razas. No obstante, el contenido de la enseñanza no se había ajustado a los cambios que amerita dicha diversidad, ¡pero eso está cambiando!
Tomemos el caso de la ciudad de Nueva York. El distrito escolar de New York City está compuesto predominantemente de minorías: 26% son afro-americanos, 41% latinos, 16% asiáticos y un 15% caucásico. Los tres primeros no se han visto representados de manera adecuada a la hora de reexaminar su historia. Por eso, una iniciativa implementada en agosto se encarga de exponer a nuestros hijos al legado de aquellos seres humanos que hace 400 años llegaron encadenados a las costas de América. La idea se conoce como “New York Times’s 1619 project”.
El 1619 Project consta de una compilación de ensayos y poesía escritas -casi en su totalidad- por autores negros. El propósito de este currículo es dual. Por un lado, se aspira a que las escuelas se replanteen cómo se enseña la esclavitud desde una perspectiva que toma en cuenta la brutalidad, complejidad e influencia en la formación de Estados Unidos. Y por el otro, se busca afirmar la identidad negra y sus muchas contribuciones al país.
Todavía no es obligatorio que en los grandes distritos escolares se imparta docencia con este contenido tan culturalmente relevante. Sin embargo, en ciudades como Chicago ya lo han adoptado como recurso suplementario.
Hay que “recentrar” la historia alrededor de la gente “que ha sido olvidada”, comentaron los profesores Albino y Alexa Achille, quienes trabajan para una de las escuelas Facing History que operan en Nueva York, Nueva Jersey y Connecticut. ¿Cómo se consigue esta recentralización?
En uno de los poemas del proyecto, de acuerdo con The74million.org, se narra la devastación emocional y física que experimentaron los esclavos embarcados en el viaje transatlántico que hoy se conoce como the Middle Passage. Otro poema explica el papel del esclavo en la tarea de levantar la infraestructura del país. Todo, desde las iglesias hasta las vías ferroviarias y las cosechas de algodón se irguieron gracias a la explotación de su mano de obra, lo que permitió la consolidación del poder económico global de Estados Unidos.
Cuando el Albino preguntó a sus alumnos: “¿Cómo se refleja el legado de la esclavitud en el desenlace del huracán Katrina en Nueva Orleans?”, uno se aventuró a decir: “confinaron a las personas dentro del estadio de la misma forma que lo hacían en el vientre de los barcos”. Otro, “la gente estaba viviendo su vida normal y de pronto vino el huracán Katrina y básicamente forzó a todo el mundo a volver a empezar”.
“El huracán es una metáfora de la gente blanca, quienes arrebataron de sus casas a la gente negra y se la llevaron lejos de sus comunidades”, agregó un estudiante. A lo cual el profesor añadió: “es una especia de reflexión sobre el papel que la deshumanización ha jugado a través de la historia de América”.
Mata, un chico dominico-cubano, remató el ejercicio con una profunda reflexión sobre el estado actual de las cosas: “la gente de color están automáticamente un paso atrás. Debido a la esclavitud, una barrera ha sido puesta frente a ellos y ha tomado un largo tiempo romperla, incluso ahora mismo”.
Después de escucharlo, me quedé deseando que el ejemplo de Chicago sea emulado por muchas otras ciudades, donde nuestras minorías continúan sufriendo condiciones de marginalización, sobre todo en la educación.

Mark Ruffalo talks about new film 'Dark Waters'

Texto completo: Mark Ruffalo was shocked.
You see, apart from being an Oscar-nominated actor best known for playing the Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Ruffalo is also an environmental activist; he co-founded Water Defense in 2011 to raise awareness about the impact energy extraction has on water and public health.
And "The Lawyer Who Became DuPont's Worst Nightmare" had hit him hard. Nathaniel Rich's 2016 piece for the New York Times Magazine chronicled attorney Rob Bilott's fight to expose impact of the DuPont chemical company's release of PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid, which it had pumped as powder into the Ohio River near a West Virginia facility for decades, according to Rich's reporting. PFOA is a compound used in the manufacture of Teflon.
"If you are a sentient being reading this article in 2016, you already have PFOA in your blood," Rich wrote. "It is in your parents' blood, your children's blood, your lover's blood. How did it get there? Through the air, through your diet, through your use of nonstick cookware, through your umbilical cord. Or you might have drunk tainted water."
Scientists, according to Rich's reporting, found a "probable link" between PFOA and ailments including kidney, testicular and thyroid cancers, as well as high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.
"I was just floored," said Ruffalo. "It's like the biggest corporate criminality, spanning 50 years, no accountability, and no one knew about it."
Ruffalo is working to change that with "Dark Waters." The film — opening in select cinemas Friday, Nov. 22 before expanding on Nov. 29 and playing nationwide on Dec. 6 — was produced by Ruffalo.
He also stars as Bilott, a environmental corporate defense attorney who spent years on the issue of PFOA as the work took its toll on his health and career.
The question of Bilott's motivation compelled Ruffalo, the actor said.
"Was there really a rebellious quality in him? Did he have a chip on his shoulder about something?" Ruffalo wondered. Instead, the actor kept coming back to a much more straightforward answer.
"He believed in people, and he saw the world as a jury of his peers," Ruffalo said of Bilott. "And (he believed that) once he laid out enough evidence and it was compelling enough, that they would decide to do the right thing. That's how he handled everything, and it's that kind of dispassionate, unemotional, empirical sort of one foot in front of the other until we get to where we need to be that was his ethos.
"As an actor, you want the big, dramatic moments. You want the juicy scenes. You want the moment where our hero gets to confront the bad guy and take him down, but that's just not the nature of Rob and that's not the nature of the story."
Oscar-winning actor and activist Tim Robbins co-stars in "Dark Waters" as Tom Terp, Bilott's supervising partner at the Cincinnati law firm of Taft Stettinius and Hollister LLP who provides Bilott with crucial support in contrast to the firm's history of representing chemical companies.
"That's what spoke to me, it was the unexpected nature of it," said Robbins, "the man whose law firm represents chemical companies, to take on a case that is holding a chemical company responsible for polluting the environment. This is not their wheelhouse, right? This is not something they normally do. I find characters like that really inspiring."
DuPont and Chemours, a former DuPont unit that spun off into its own company in 2015, arrived at a $670.7 million settlement to settle 3,550 lawsuits related to the release of PFOA in 2017.
Terp and Bilott could, Robbins said, serve as guides for how more changes could come in the future.
"It's not like they're your liberal reformers or anything, it's people who go outside their own corporate culture to pursue something based on morality, based on right and wrong and not on profit margin," said Robbins. "And quite frankly, it's going to be up to people like Tom Terp to realize that morality in themselves and take risks and perhaps compromise their position of power or their livelihood to do the right thing."
Directed by Oscar nominee Todd Haynes from a screenplay by Mario Correa and Matthew Michael Carnahan, "Dark Waters" is a Focus Features release presented by Participant.
Haynes' film is firmly in the whistleblower cinema tradition that includes "All The President's Men" (1976) and "The Post" (2017), specifically the environmental and legal sub-genre alongside Oscar-winner "Erin Brockovich" (2000) and Oscar nominee "A Civil Action" (1997).
But it also has plenty in common with Ruffalo and Participant's 2015 modern classic "Spotlight," which earned a Best Picture Oscar and a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Ruffalo. Both films are non-sensationalist, methodical examination of all of the work — legal in the case of "Dark Waters," journalistic in "Spotlight" — that goes into uncovering the truth.
"Dark Waters," with its exposure of DuPont practices, also serves as an inadvertent companion piece to "Foxcatcher." That 2014 starred an Oscar-nominated Ruffalo as Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz, who was murdered in 1996 by chemical empire heir John du Pont, played by Steve Carrell.
Taken together, "Dark Waters" and "Foxcatcher" chillingly speak to the free reign our society has afforded powerful corporations and families.
"It is a corporate elite in America that basically because of economic reasons are given free hand to pollute, to dominate, to run amok," Ruffalo said. "Whether it's John du Pont in 'Foxcatcher' and his delusions of grandeur that came from a lifetime of privilege and money or it's DuPont as a corporate entity who was a driving economic factor in American business.
"If all we value is the GDP of a country as a value of its health or well-being, then you're going to have a lot more stories like the PFOA story and a lot more companies like DuPont who knowingly and willingly poisoned the world for pure profit and the almighty dollar."
"Dark Waters," 126 minutes, rated PG-13, open in select cinemas before expanding on Friday and playing nationwide on Dec. 6. More info: www.focusfeatures.com/dark-waters.

Renée Taylor on 'Diet,' comedy and her late husband

Texto completo: Following the Vogue Champagne Diet, Renée Taylor downed two glasses of bubbly before each meal.
Now, not cheap champagne. Cheap champagne has more calories.
"I lost weight, but I became a $200-a-day Cristal drunk," the legendary comedian said.
Aye, there's the rub.
And there's always a rub.
"The Nanny" star, who is 86, is sharing her story of life, food and what she learned in the hilarious "My Life On A Diet," now through Dec.15 at George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick.
"I just happened to remember my life in terms of what I was eating," Taylor said. "I would say to my friends, 'oh yeah, that's when we were on the Last Chance Diet.' Whenever I met somebody famous, I'd ask them what they were eating because I thought, well if I eat like them, I'll look like them. So it never worked, but that's how I was thinking."
She was forever on a quest to lose weight in search of nailing roles.
"I thought if I looked a certain way, I'd have a certain kind of a career, so I was always losing weight for different parts."
And there were so many diets.
"I was on the amphetamine diet. There was a time where everybody was taking Dexamyls before they had a meal. And I was on the Last Chance Diet, which was a liquid protein. I got off that because people died. I read in The New York Times that you can't live on that little amount of protein a day and so people died."
Ultimately, it was the "The Nanny," the '90s sitcom starring Fran Drescher, that ended that quest. Taylor played Drescher's overbearing Jewish mother, Sylvia.
"I had a lot of success when I was on 'The Nanny' and I was overweight and I really saw it didn't matter what my weight was, people didn't care about whether I was fat or whether I was thin," she said. "But it all had to do with your image of yourself, I came to see that it was really just a way of sidetracking, distracting myself by being on a diet all the time.
In addition to pointing to "The Nanny" as a turning point in her life in regard to her relationship with food, it also was a highlight of her career, she says.
"It was so much fun. We laughed all the time. When I first did it, the costume designer, Brenda Cooper, who won an Emmy for the clothes on the show, I met her in a department store and she said, 'This is what you're gonna wear.' And I said, 'Who would wear something like that?' And she said, 'You!' That was a wonderful introduction to the character because, and I had never won a girdle before, but she said, 'Would you wear a girdle? It makes you walk a certain way, you move a certain way,' and it was true. And when your hair is so high, you move a certain way. So it was really wonderful to explore a character from the physical appearance and then find out who that person was."
She wrote of her experiences in "My Life On A Diet" as a book, and her late husband, actor, playwright and screenwriter Joe Bologna, suggested it would make a great one-woman show.
And he was right. Not only has the comedy been a success, but Taylor says people come up to her after the show and share their stories of the crazy diets they've been on.
Taylor says Bologna did draw a line for the show.
"The pregnant women's urine diet. Well, that's pretty wild. You know, you inject yourself with pregnant women's urine before you eat. Actually it works. I don't really know why, but it does. I lost a lot of weight on it. I did that diet but my husband didn't want to put it in the show. (He) thought it was too gross."
Taylor says ultimately, in addition to learning to accept herself, she learned lifestyle changes are much more important than fad diets.
"They are all pretty crazy. You know if you eat eight bananas a day, you're going to lose weight, whatever kind of restrictions you give yourself, it's going to work for a certain period of time. But then you learn that what's really important is your body feeling good. That's really what's important and it's really your lifestyle, not your diet."
Taylor says her outlook as a comic also has a major impact on her life.
"In my family, everybody was so serious that I just made jokes. I don't like to be serious for too long a period, so I always think of something funny. Everything strikes me as funny. I don't take myself seriously. I really don't. Because you know why? Because life is too serious to take it serious or to take things personally. I just let things go."
She says that sharing her story through comedy allows her to get important messages across, and also serves as a connection to Bologna.
"It's really great to share with people that way and since my husband died two years ago and he directed the show and wrote it with me, doing the show is very healing for me to re-create the humor that we had together. He comes to life every night when I do it on the stage. So that's a wonderful feeling for me."
"My Life On A Diet" is the first full production in the Arthur Laurents Theatre at the new New Brunswick Performing Arts Center.
"That was a real honor," she said.

Texto completo: Shifts in the number of daylight hours -- because of changing seasons or long-distance travel -- can have varying effects on people. For some, limited daylight hours can sap energy. But for others, the effects can be more serious. After conducting 29 hours of research -- including reading two books and five comprehensive studies on the subject, and interviewing one of the scientists who discovered seasonal affective disorder (SAD) -- we determined that we would use the Carex Day-Light Classic Plus Lamp to treat SAD symptoms. KIT DILLON and ANNA PERLING
What is seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?
Many people experience some emotional or physical changes with the arrival of new seasons, especially winter: Your mood may swing, your eating habits might shift, and your energy levels may rise or fall. Some people are less able to cope with these changes. SAD is a seasonal pattern of major depressive episodes as diagnosed by a physician according to criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. (We repeat: This diagnosis can only be made by a trained physician and should not be self-diagnosed.)
For most of us, these seasonal shifts in our moods and energy might be annoying, but they're fairly simple to manage. Then there's a second group--those who feel the weight of these changes in a more serious manner. Maybe the symptoms aren't quite severe enough to seek a doctor's opinion, but they certainly make it hard to get out of the house in winter. It's what we sometimes informally call the winter blues. A third group experiences these changes so severely that their lives are seriously disrupted. It's this last group that we would typically describe as suffering from seasonal affective disorder. If you have true SAD, the cold months may feel like a physical exhaustion that will never end.
How SAD lamps work
In 1980, Alfred Lewy published the finding that sufficiently intense artificial light suppressed humans' nighttime production of melatonin -- a hormone linked to the regulation of our sleep cycle.
"[Dr. Robert] Sack and I realized that humans really don't have seasonal rhythms like animals do, like breeding and hibernation and reproduction," Lewy explained over the phone. "We proposed a 'phase shift hypothesis' that is still the leading hypothesis for how bright lights treat SAD, which is that in the winter, with the shorter days, most people's circadian rhythms drift late with the later dawn: out of phase with their natural sleep-wake cycle. It's like having jet lag for five months. With morning bright-light exposure, those rhythms are pushed back earlier, back into phase with their sleep."
Today, "bright light therapy is recommended as the first-line option" for the treatment of SAD, according to a 2003 review in the journal Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience. Far from being a fringe or "alternative" purported remedy for SAD, light therapy has been clinically shown to work to alleviate symptoms in more than 60 studies in serious scientific publications.
Wirecutter's pick
This Carex lamp meets all of the criteria necessary to be considered therapeutically effective and safe, and it's cheaper than many of its competitors. The lamp's 99.3 percent UV-free light and 10,000-lux light intensity, and its large, 250-square-inch face, mean you won't have to sit in front of it for more than 30 minutes (the minimum length of time that experts recommend) to experience its physiological benefits. For several years, it was the top recommendation from the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, a nonprofit collective of scientists and clinicians dedicated to research and education about environmental therapies.
Another great option
If you're willing to pay a bit more for the sleekest light therapy lamp we looked at, or if our pick is unavailable, we recommend the Northern Light Technologies Boxelite Desk Lamp. With a minimalist, square design, the Boxelite is the lamp we'd like to put on our own desks. It has a large light face, which provides 10,000 lux of UV-free light at 14 inches (a farther distance than our top pick and runner-up). But the Boxelite isn't adjustable, unlike the Day-Light Classic Plus, and it doesn't have the endorsement that our main pick did.
Disclaimer
The F.D.A. does not test, approve, or regulate light-box devices. This guide is not a replacement for an official diagnosis of SAD by a physician. While many of us might catch a case of the blahs when the weather gets colder and the days longer, that's far different from a clinical case of SAD, which should only be diagnosed and treated by a medical professional. You should use a SAD lamp or light box only under medical supervision, as it is, in fact, a medical device.

Texto completo: They wanted to take down Biden. But they also wanted to absolve Moscow of election meddling.
The Ukraine scandal now unfolding in congressional impeachment hearings has at its core a Shakespearean twist: President Trump, abetted by his paladins of spin, has trapped himself in an alternate universe. To undermine the well-established fact that Russia corrupted the 2016 vote to help him win, Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to build a fiction that pins those crimes on Ukraine.
In doing so, he has confirmed our darkest fears. The president's bid to solicit foreign help to impugn a domestic political rival in 2019 should wipe away any doubts about his willingness to do the same with Russian help in 2016.
Mr. Trump and his enablers -- Rudolph Giuliani foremost among them -- have scrambled all year to do two deeds at once. They want to besmirch Joe Biden, without foundation, for supposedly using his office as vice president to protect his son Hunter, who served until recently on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. And they want to reinvent what happened in 2016 so as to switch the blame for the election meddling from Moscow to Kyiv.
Congress is rightly focused on the quid pro quo demands that Mr. Trump was making of the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to further his own personal political interests. But the effort to rewrite the history of 2016 is no less insidious.
As the founders of Fusion GPS, the research firm that commissioned the reports by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele that raised some of the earliest warnings of Russia's actions, we're willing to clear up some of the nonsense now so abundant on the right.
House Republicans like Representatives Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan seem eager to portray Fusion as co-conspirators with the Ukrainians in some devilish plot to undermine Mr. Trump's 2016 candidacy. That could not be farther from the truth. None of the information in the so-called Steele dossier came from Ukrainian sources. Zero. And we've never met Serhiy Leshchenko, the Ukrainian former legislator and journalist whom Republicans want to blame for the downfall of Mr. Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
That said, our investigation of Donald Trump did get a great boost because of Ukraine, just not in the way Republicans imagine. We began looking into Mr. Trump's business dealings and ties to Russia in the fall of 2015 with funding from Republicans who wanted to stop his political ascent. The Ukraine alarms went off six months later, when candidate Trump brought into his campaign none other than Mr. Manafort, a man with his own tangled history with Russian oligarchs trying to get their way in Ukraine.
It turns out we already knew a great deal about Mr. Manafort's activities in Ukraine because we worked on several stories about his work for Russian-backed politicians eight years earlier, when we were both still writing for The Wall Street Journal. That reporting threw a spotlight on how Mr. Manafort, while representing clients involved in fierce geopolitical struggles over Ukraine, had neglected to comply with a lobbying law requiring that he register as a foreign agent -- the very law, among others, to which he pleaded guilty of violating.
Those articles triggered years of media coverage exposing Mr. Manafort's questionable lobbying activities and ties to pro-Russia oligarchs. In the meantime, we left The Journal and went on to found Fusion GPS, a research and strategic intelligence firm, in 2010.
We turned our focus back to Mr. Manafort in early 2016 and soon found a 19-page legal filing in a federal courthouse in Virginia in which one of his former clients, the Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, accused Mr. Manafort in scorching detail of making off with tens of millions of dollars that he had promised to invest in Ukraine. The whole thing reeked of fraud and possible money laundering. It was as if Mr. Manafort had boarded the Trump campaign plane with baggage stuffed with figurative explosives. The Virginia filings later surfaced in various articles about Manafort in the national media.
A few months later we stumbled on some Ukrainian media reports noting that documents existed in Kyiv that chronicled the political spending of the pro-Russia ruling party at the time, which had hired Mr. Manafort. We wondered if his name might crop up in those papers. Someone suggested Mr. Leshchenko might be of help in the matter -- a fact we stored away. To this day, we have never met him.
The New York Times got to the story first, in August 2016, reporting that a black ledger of illicit payments showed that millions of dollars had gone into the pocket of one Paul Manafort. That story led to Mr. Manafort's ouster from the campaign, and undoubtedly fueled F.B.I. interest in his activities, though the so-called black ledger was never used in the criminal cases against him.
We'd love to take credit for finding the black ledger, but we didn't, and any alert reporter following the Ukrainian press would have known to follow the leads that led to it.
That hasn't stopped Republicans from weaving conspiracy theories about our work in Ukraine. Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer and the main stirrer of the conspiracy pot in Ukraine, cooked up a fresh fabrication just this week, telling Glenn Beck on his TV program that he had "very strong evidence that a lot of the Steele dossier was produced in Ukraine" and that "Glenn Simpson spent a fair amount of time there during the time that the dossier was being written."
By sheer coincidence, one of us -- the aforementioned Mr. Simpson -- found himself on a plane from New York to Washington with Mr. Giuliani just hours later, and he couldn't resist confronting the former New York mayor about his claim after they landed.
"I understand you think I spent a lot of time in Ukraine?" Mr. Simpson inquired.
"You did spend some time in Ukraine," Mr. Giuliani replied.
"Did I?" Mr. Simpson asked as he waved his phone in front of Mr. Giuliani, signaling that he was recording the encounter.
"What if I told you I have never been to Ukraine in my life?"
"Well," Mr. Giuliani replied with equanimity, "O.K. I will find out if that's true or not."
It's true. So, Mr. Giuliani is still investigating the lies he hopes will save a deeply corrupt presidency. That should chill all Americans.
Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch are the founders of Fusion GPS and authors of the upcoming book, "Crime in Progress: Inside the Steele Dossier and the Fusion GPS Investigation of Donald Trump."

Texto completo: The holiday consumerist orgy seems like it starts earlier and earlier in my interfaith household. This year it began in early October: That's when the American Girl catalog arrived and my kids nearly came to blows over who was going to get the $ 150 doll-size pinball machine. (Girls, neither of you is ever getting that damn toy.) I saw a crazed gleam in their eyes as they looked at page after page of expensive dolls with their beautiful outfits and tricked-out accessories.
Because we celebrate Christmas and Hanukkah, and my older daughter's birthday is right after Thanksgiving, it feels like my children are getting presents every day during December. I find myself feeling a little hungover from the consumption -- my own included. It's tough to resist those Black Friday mega-deals flashing in your inbox, even when you know your budget is tight from childcare and all the other kid-related expenses.
I don't want to deprive my two girls of holiday magic, but I don't want them to become materialistic nightmares, and I don't want to go into debt every December buying trendy toys that will become landfill fodder in six months. So I asked Ron Lieber, the Your Money columnist for The New York Times and author of "The Opposite of Spoiled," a guide to teaching children about money and values, for his advice.
JESSICA GROSE During the holiday season, how do you keep your children's gift haul reasonable, knowing that even if you keep it simple, grandparents and other family members often want to spoil your little ones?
RON LIEBER It's sort of hopeless to try to control the relatives. So forget that.
Given that we're always trying to get the littles to understand the difference between wants and needs, and to consider trade-offs between spending, saving and giving, what about this: You get one thing you want. One thing you need. And one sum of money to give to anyone or anything else you choose.
And if you're Jewish and you simply must do gifts all eight nights, you could trade off each of those three things doing one each night -- starting with give and/or need, so that there are only two "want" nights, just to keep things somewhat in check.
GROSE What's the best way to teach the 6-and-under set about the value of the gifts they're getting, when their grasp of number concepts (or even where their feet are) may be limited?
LIEBER I'm not sure there is a way, but I'm not sure that it's necessary, either. Unless you live in a bubble in a truly homogeneous community, they're probably already learning about differences and developing a sense of perspective around value. And getting them started with thinking about giving -- and that some people need help or gifts more than they do -- is plenty fine in the first five years in terms of setting them up for deeper conversations later about however lucky they may be.
GROSE How should parents think about budgeting for the holidays, especially if they are celebrating more than one?
LIEBER Share the budget with the kids! Set your budget, explain why it is what it is. (This is important! What else are you emphasizing in your family life in terms of priorities? Explain it!) And then, if you want, say something like the following: "O.K., we're going to spend $ 100 per child this holiday season. Give us a list of things you need that are under $ 33 and things that you want that are under $ 33. Then help them give that last chunk of money away.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — From the mountains of shoes that were worn by Jews when they were packed into railroad freight cars bound for Auschwitz, the Museum of Jewish Heritage: A Living Memorial to the Holocaust displays one: a woman’s red dress pump with a three-inch heel. It prompts viewers to wonder: Where did she think she was going?
Perhaps she did not have time to think when she was swept into the vortex of one of Europe’s innumerable roundups. She was destined for the unimaginable, where she probably vanished quickly: 900,000 of the 1.3 million people sent there were murdered shortly after their arrival.
The New York Times of January 28, 1945, reported on its front page the Red Army’s arrival the day before at Auschwitz, which the story described, in its 16th paragraph, as a place where more than a million “persons” were murdered. Persons. Of them, 1 million were Jews.
A yellowed Times edition from that date is displayed today in the museum, which is located on Manhattan’s southern tip, near the spot where, in 1654, 23 Jews who had come from Spain and Portugal, via Brazil, became the first Jews in what was then New Amsterdam. The museum’s six-sided Core building evokes the six-pointed star of David, and the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, which is the subject of a shattering exhibit, “Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away.” The eloquence of the artifacts, which were first seen when the exhibit opened in Madrid and will be seen elsewhere in North America, is welcome testimony, in an age obsessed with new media, to the power of an old medium: the museum.
The exhibit includes Reinhard Heydrich’s gift for Hermann Goering on his 47th birthday. Before Heydrich was assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942, he was the “architect of the Final Solution.” His gift was a piece of parchment: the original 1551 proclamation, signed by the Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, requiring Jews to attach to their garments a yellow circle. The seeds of the Holocaust germinated for centuries in Europe’s social soil. They did not, however, have to come to their cataclysmic fruition.
Other artifacts include Heinrich Himmler’s handwriting in his annotated first edition of “Mein Kampf.” And a photo of Anne Frank’s parents’ wedding. And a child’s shoe with a sock carefully tucked into it, waiting for the child to put it back on after the “shower” to which he had been directed, from which he did not return.
Did you know that eight of the 15 participants in the Jan. 20, 1942, Wannsee Conference, which finalized plans for the industrialization of murder, had doctoral degrees? Education is not necessarily an inoculation against evil. Only two participants were older than 50: Genocide was a project for up-and-comers, idealists who acquired the ideals from socialization under totalitarianism.
The exhibit includes grainy, black-and-white film of a passing freight train shedding notes the way a tree shed leaves in autumn, notes tossed from between the freight cars’ slats by the human cargo who were desperate to scatter random traces of themselves before the final darkness. One was tossed from a train leaving Holland by 17-year-old Hertha Aussen: “Most likely this will be the last card you will receive from me.” Three days later she was murdered on arrival at Auschwitz.
What also died at Auschwitz is — was — what is known as the Whig theory of history, which holds, or held, that there is an inevitable unfolding of history in the direction of expanding liberty under law. Just as the Holocaust was not inevitable, neither is the triumph of enlightenment: History is not a ratchet that clicks only one way. Today, in several parts of the world, including on the dark, churned and bloody ground of central Europe, there are various forms of political regression. These are marked by a recrudescence of the blood-and-soil tribalism of degenerate nationalism, accompanied by thinly veiled, or not at all veiled, antisemitism.
Visitors entering “Auschwitz. Not long ago. Not far away” immediately walk past these words of Primo Levi, an Auschwitz survivor: “It happened, therefore it can happen again.”
Today in China’s far west, concentration camps hold more than a million people who Beijing says show “symptoms” of being “infected” with the “virus” of “unhealthy thoughts.”
Similar medical terminology presented the Holocaust as social hygiene.
Polls indicate that a majority of millennials do not know what Auschwitz was. The future might teach them by analogies.

Texto completo: Most of our public discourse about racism — when it’s not about violence or monuments or presidential rhetoric — is about white privilege, implicit bias and structural racism. Instead of specific actors, we tend to focus on forces that don’t actually implicate anyone in particular.
Those forces are real. And those conversations are important. Racial inequality is about the structure of our society. But it’s also about more ordinary bias and discrimination.
There are still racist individuals. They still act in racist ways. And in the aggregate, their actions still work to disadvantage entire groups on the basis of race. It’s not as visible as it once was, but it is real, and it still weighs on the lives — and the livelihoods — of millions of people.
A potent example comes from a deep new investigation of housing discrimination. Working with outside experts, Newsday, the leading newspaper on Long Island, New York, conducted a three-year investigation into racism in the housing market there, sending pairs of undercover testers (black and white, Hispanic and white, Asian and white) in sequence to real estate agents throughout the area.
The testers reported racially disparate treatment in 40% of interactions with real estate agents. Black testers experienced disparate treatment in 49% of cases, Hispanic testers in 39% and Asian testers in 19%. Some real estate agents refused to show listings or conduct house tours for minority testers; others steered them away from predominantly white neighborhoods. They warned white testers away from black or Hispanic neighborhoods while also showing more listings and allowing them to see homes without proof of mortgage-ready financing.
This was one investigation in one part of the country with a specific history of housing discrimination and racism. But a similar study from 2012 — conducted by the Urban Institute and the Department of Housing and Urban Development — showed nationwide patterns of housing discrimination. After conducting 8,000 tests in a representative sample of 28 metropolitan areas, researchers found that, compared with whites, black renters and homebuyers were shown substantially fewer units, as were, to a lesser extent, Asian Americans and Hispanics.
Discrimination is common, not just in housing but in employment as well. Fifty-six percent of black Americans, 33% of Hispanics and 27% of Asian Americans said they experienced racial discrimination when applying for jobs, according to a 2017 survey by NPR and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Their self-reporting is backed by data. A 2017 meta-analysis of field experiments on racial discrimination found that for black Americans, discrimination has been static — there has been no change since 1989. Whites still receive more than a third more callbacks for jobs, even after accounting for education, local labor market conditions and other factors.
Not every instance of workplace discrimination is reported to authorities — far from it. But it’s not for nothing that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency tasked with tackling unfair treatment in the labor market, has received hundreds of thousands of complaints of racial discrimination at workplaces since 2010.
Large and persistent racial gaps in housing and employment are a fact of American life. The black unemployment rate is still consistently higher than the white unemployment rate; blacks are still disproportionately concentrated in low-wage, low-advancement positions; and African Americans are still more likely than any other group to live in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty and disadvantage.
“It is difficult or in some cases impossible to reproduce in white communities the structural circumstances under which many black Americans live,” as sociologist William Julius Wilson put it.
A good deal of this is the long overhang of past discrimination, the legacy of Jim Crow and redlining and urban renewal and the deliberate neglect of communities of color by authorities at all levels of government. But despite what we might believe about modern American society, some of it is the result of ongoing explicit discrimination. Millions of Americans are still taking deliberate action to deny jobs and homes on the basis of race.
A recent study shows how this might look in practice. Black and white job seekers receive job leads from their social networks at similar rates. They use those networks at similar rates, too. But as David Pedulla and Devah Pager (who died last year) show,
“black job seekers are less likely than white job seekers to (1) know someone at the companies to which they are submitting applications, and (2) have their network mobilize key resources on their behalf, specifically contact an employer on their behalf.”
This could be an unfortunate happenstance, I guess. But more likely it reflects past discrimination and how it continues to shape the labor market, especially when present and future opportunity depends on past access.
There are solutions — you can expand state and federal anti-discrimination agencies, as well as fully enforce the Fair Housing Act, for starters — but the first step is to shake ourselves of the idea that explicit racial discrimination is yesterday’s problem. It’s a live force in American life that works in tandem with structural racism to recapitulate past injustice and reproduce racial disadvantage, a one-two punch that ensures its future.

Texto completo: Un fotógrafo contó que él y varios colegas suyos llevaban horas cerca del muro fronterizo, en espera de ver migrantes que se acercaran y cruzaran de Tijuana (México) a San Diego (California) por encima o por debajo del cerco. Esto, indicó, formaba parte de su trabajo como periodistas para cubrir el tema de las caravanas.
Así llevaban varios días, cuando indicó que de manera sorpresiva, policías municipales tijuanenses llegron a exigir la revisión de documentos a los reporteros.
“Nos exigían a todos de mala manera que diéramos los pasaportes, nos tomaban fotos con sus teléfonos celulares y anotaban para qué medios trabajábamos”, explicó el fotógrafo, quien prefirió ocultar su nombre para prevenir represalias.
Alegan que el mismo operativo de policías se repitió varias veces entre octubre de 2018 y enero de 2019.
Poco después, agregó, varios periodistas independientes —que trabajaron asignados a cubrir la caravana migrante para medios como The Guardian, The New York Times, Reuters, The Intercept y UPI— pasaron por interrogatorios cada vez que cruzaban la frontera de Tijuana a San Diego, generalmente durante horas.
Incluso, algunos de esos periodistas se vieron impedidos de ingresar a México porque sus documentos tenían una “alerta de seguridad” que, según fuentes del Instituto Nacional de Migración de México, “había puesto un gobierno”.
En marzo de 2019 se supo que ese gobierno era el de EEUU, cuando la filial de la cadena NBC en San Diego publicó datos de CBP sobre 59 periodistas, abogados de migración y activistas a los que esa agencia identificaba como “instigadores” de la caravana migrante.
La lista secreta de CBP “Operaciones Fronterizas del sector San Diego”, llevaba como subtítulo; “Caravana migrante, presuntos organizadores, coordinadores, instigadores y medios de comunicación”.
CBP dijo a la prensa que conformó el banco de datos porque suponía que las personas incluidas en la lista “podrían tener información sobre la caravana”.
Sin embargo el martes de esta semana un exagente de investigaciones de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) que estaba asignado a San Diego y San Ysidro reveló que CBP, con su acoso, intentó general la impresión de que investigaba a los periodistas y abogados de migración por delitos criminales.
El exgente Wesley Petonak informó que fue él quien tomó fotos al banco de datos y se las entregó a NBC. Dijo que había advertido a sus supervisores que se violaban los derechos de periodistas y abogados, pero la respuesta fue que era un “proceso regular”.
De acuerdo con el agente, la lista incluye a diez periodistas, tres abogadas, entre ellas se sabe de dos de Al Otro Lado, y docenas de activistas de derechos de los migrantes.
Fue por ello, que ACLU presentó la demanda esta semana.
“Un principio central de nuestra democracia es la libertad de prensa. Esa libertad está en peligro cuando el gobierno usa el pretexto de la inspección fronteriza para interrogar a los periodistas que simplemente estaban haciendo su trabajo”, declaró EshaBhandari, abogada de la ACLU para tecnología, privacidad y libertad de expresión.
Por su parte, la Asociación de Periodistas Profesionales de San Diego declaró ayer que “los periodistas no son informantes ni agentes de inteligencia del gobierno de los EEUU”.
“Estas tácticas son comunes en los regímenes dictatoriales pero no tienen cabida en una democracia saludable”, aseveró la asociación.
Enfatizó que “es alarmante que los periodistas detenidos fueran todos comunicadores independientes, que pueden haber sido vistos como blancos más fáciles para el acoso”.
Por su parte CBP en San Diego informó a La Opinión que “CBP no comenta sobre litigios pendientes. Sin embargo, la falta de comentarios no debe interpretarse como estar de acuerdo con ninguna de las acusaciones”.

Texto completo: MANILA, Philippines - As public anger mounted last year over delayed plans to shake up the Philippines' outage-plagued telecommunications sector, angry comments and one-star ratings flooded a government-run Facebook page.
When employees suspected online trolls, President Rodrigo Duterte's digital mastermind offered a solution.
"I'll handle this," said Nic Gabunada, the architect of the social media strategy that powered Duterte's 2016 election victory, according to a government employee who managed the Facebook page.
Pro-Duterte comments soon poured onto the page, with users defending the president's handling of the situation or blaming the problems on the previous administration. Many of the new commenters had only basic profile information on their pages, which featured mostly generic posts with religious or pro-government messages.
"It was Nic," said the employee, who was interviewed on the condition her name not be used for fear of retribution. "The fact that he had a troll army was known by everyone, but not openly talked about."
In the Philippines, candidates and government officials routinely pay vast cyber-troll armies that create multiple fake social media accounts to smear opponents and prop themselves up.
It's all part of the online propaganda wars shaking politics in the country.
And it could soon be coming to the U.S., according to election officials and disinformation scholars who are watching closely. They warn that the Philippine epidemic probably will spread here, given Filipinos' proficiency in English, facility with social media and the lure of money from campaigns looking for a new way to get an edge over the competition.
Already, U.S. operatives in both parties have made early efforts at using trolls for political gain. Rogue progressives stealthily launched fake social media campaigns against Roy Moore, the GOP nominee for Senate in Alabama, during a 2017 special election. Their campaign aimed to confuse voters into thinking Moore supported banning alcohol and that Russian bots were working on his behalf.
The New York Times revealed the plot, along with an earlier, aborted plan developed by a firm run by former Israeli intelligence agents to engage dozens of paid trolls in swaying delegates to Donald Trump during the 2016 GOP convention. The plan was requested by a senior Trump campaign official but was not carried out.
"The presence of a large for-hire market looking at all the disinformation online that you can buy and people are selling is quite disturbing," Camille Francois, the chief innovation officer of Graphika, a firm that helps tech companies and government investigators find and confront online disinformation, said at a Federal Election Commission symposium in September.
"What these troll farms are reporting is a growth of global business. What do we do about that?"
Manila, alone, has hundreds of active troll farms. The shadowy networks act as weapons that, for the right price, can build artificial buzz around a product, a celebrity - or a political figure.
Those troll techniques "will be used more and more," said Malou N. Tiquia, chief executive of the Manila political strategy consultancy Publicus Asia. "When Facebook said it won't ban political ads, that was already a signal to everyone that anything goes."
U.S. regulators have barely begun to consider the mounting threat, and Silicon Valley has shown itself lacking the tools and will to effectively confront it. Tech firms are making little headway stamping out the scourge where it has emerged so far, even after Facebook in March removed from its platform 200 pages for "inauthentic" activity and took the rare step of identifying Gabunada's network as the culprit.
The Filipino digital propagandist has denied trafficking in misinformation and did not respond to texts seeking comment about his work for the Duterte administration.
Such moves by Facebook are doing little to slow the trolls.
Filipinos spend so much time online - they average a staggering 10 hours a day, according to industry data - and disinformation has spiraled so quickly that Katie Harbath, Facebook public policy director for global elections, branded it "patient zero in the global disinformation epidemic" during a 2018 talk in Berlin.
"The propaganda looks really organic and it often doesn't trip any of the flags" that alert tech companies, said Jonathan Ong, a professor of global digital media at University of Massachusetts Amherst whose research has taken him inside Filipino troll farms.
Political campaigns contract out their digital efforts to consultants, who in turn pay up to $1,000 per month to college students and recent graduates who are charged with launching multiple fake Facebook pages designed to look like they were created by actual voters or grassroots groups.
"It is so easy to be enlisted in these jobs," Ong said. His recent study on the industry includes an interview with one paid troll who fell into the work when the chief of staff of the political campaign she was working on ordered everyone to start creating fake accounts and posting on them.
Others have fleeting loyalties politically but are attracted to the cash. Consultants running troll farms have been known to switch sides in the middle of an election.
"The alliances are very shifty," Ong said. "Strategists will switch in the middle of a campaign to join who they think will be the winner. They will betray their client. It happened in the last election."
Most often, the operations are run through contractors separate from the actual campaigns so the candidate has no fingerprints on the weapon. And the trolls often don't trigger attention from tech platforms because they know how to avoid detection. The algorithms that tech companies use to detect phony accounts tend to focus on dozens of commenters posting the same message around the same time, or users with a stock photo on their profile page. The trolls don't do these things.
"You can look like legitimate Facebook users to trick the (company's) artificial intelligence," said Ross Tapsell, a researcher at Australian National University who documented the surge of paid troll activity in the Philippine province of Cebu.
In some cases operatives contract the work out to troll farms in far-off places, including Saudi Arabia.
"We have only scratched the surface of what a lot of this involved," he said.

Low taxes are key to Florida's success - let's keep it that way Guest columnist

Texto completo: Florida is fortunate to be home to 19 Fortune 500 companies - employers that are directly producing thousands of private-sector jobs, playing a strong role in Florida's vibrant economy, paying and collecting billions in taxes and contributing their time, talents and resources to many of Florida's philanthropic organizations who then put hundreds of millions of dollars to help those who can't help themselves.
Yet once again, these job creators are under attack. They are the "boogie man" for activist journalism which, far too often, seeks to advance socialism over free enterprise - apparently for more clicks, likes and retweets.
Only in America could the distorted tax policy theory of some become an Orlando Sentinel headline. And situations like these are forcing job creators to become creative in their responses, just like FedEx Chairman and CEO Frederick W. Smith did recently when he tweeted his response to a New York Times front-page article on taxes.
As the late great Paul Harvey would say, "Now here's the rest of the story."
In uniting the business community for good, the Florida Chamber is shining a light on bogus, socialist-style reports that use half-truths and innuendoes in an attempt to somehow tarnish leading job creators (a system that has Florida creating one out of 13 new U.S. jobs).
Thanks to Florida job creators, Florida's unemployment level is lower than the national average. And families and businesses in high tax states like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Illinois and California are fleeing their states for lower tax climates that allow families to save for a rainy day, businesses to hire more employees or reinvest in their facilities, and to create an overall better quality of life.
These high-tax states apparently believe government creates jobs, when we all know that private sector employees create the jobs and the paychecks that are used to buy things that, in turn, create taxes that fund our government.
It's true that Florida has the fourth best tax climate in the country. That's because, unlike in high-tax states, Florida's corporate income tax reporting doesn't mandate "combined reporting." While that reporting style is favored by those who want to see Florida fail, it has not been roundly supported by economists.
In fact, Florida's own economic forecasters have said combined reporting could decrease tax revenue, something Florida's education system, environment and transportation system can't afford.
That's not an economic forecast we're willing to stake Florida's future on.
Growing Florida's economy from 17th in the world to the 10th largest on the planet means ensuring global competitiveness, prosperity and high paying jobs, and vibrant and resilient communities.
A competitive and equitable tax system that encourages job growth and strengthens our economy will be essential in achieving this goal.
That means the Florida Chamber will once again unite businesses in Florida's Capitol and fight for further reducing the corporate income tax, phasing out the business rent tax, leveling the online sales tax playing field, increasing the R&D tax credit to spur innovation, reducing the communications services tax and fixing Florida's lawsuit abuse tax.
With 4.5 million more people expected to call Florida home by 2030, we will continue to ensure Florida is a state where jobs provide Floridians an opportunity to prosper. And we will fight for free enterprise to lead the way.
For the last decade, lawmakers have been returning hard-earned tax dollars back to Floridians - through targeted tax savings like to back-to-school sales tax holidays and reductions in the corporate income tax. Yet, Florida's tax receipts continue to grow.
As Ronald Reagan used to say, if you want less of something, tax it. With all due respect to the Orlando Sentinel, we're not willing to tax Florida's future away.
Mark Wilson is the president and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce and can be reached at mwilson@flchamber.com.

Google puts two activists on leave, spurring protests; Workers say the tech giant is retaliating to intimidate dissenters.

Texto completo: About 200 Google employees and other tech workers assembled outside the company's downtown San Francisco office on Friday to call for the reinstatement of two workers placed on leave this month for reasons they claim are connected to their internal activism.
The protesters accused the company of suspending the employees, Laurence Berland and Rebecca Rivers, to intimidate and silence others inside the Alphabet-owned internet giant who have spoken out on a variety of issues including the company's pursuit of defense contracts and decreasing internal transparency.
"Our co-workers ... have been on the front lines of this struggle for freedom and good jobs for all here at Google," Stephanie Parker, a Google employee and one of the organizers of a November 2018 walkout by 20,000 Googlers, said at the rally. "Their reward? Google has suspended them from their jobs and interrogated them for speaking out. We are here today to show them our support and demand that Google bring them back immediately."

The company said the employees were placed on administrative leave as they are investigated for violating company policy by accessing and sharing documents they did not have permissions for and tracking the publicly shared calendar of other employees on the communications and human resources teams. Sleuthing by staffers on calendar entries reportedly revealed Google's hiring of a law firm known for its work against unionization campaigns.
"We have clear guidelines about appropriate conduct at work, and we've had a number of concerns raised. We always investigate such issues thoroughly," Google spokeswoman Jenn Kaiser said in a statement.
But some employees view the suspensions as part of a wider clampdown on attempts at organizing workers and as retaliation for speaking out against the company's policies and practices, including how it polices hate speech and the sale of technology to the military and federal government.
Rivers, who traveled to attend the rally from Boulder, Colo., said none of the documents she accessed were categorized as "need-to-know" or permissible to be viewed only by people in specific roles.
She also said that when she was being interviewed by the company's global investigations team she was asked about her involvement in a petition against the company's work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection as well as her social media usage outside of Google.
Berland said his access to internal servers was cut off shortly after he sent an email to the company's community moderation team. In it, he asked the moderators to stop deleting critical questions and memes that employees had posted to companywide forums.
Hours later, he was notified he was being placed on leave without being told why.
Berland said that during his interview with the Global Investigations Team he was asked about accessing other employees' calendars -- specifically members of the HR, community platforms and communications teams. Employees often view the public calendars of their co-workers, and Berland said he was looking because he was "concerned about the censorship of our workplace" and wanted to know what was going on.
"We make this the place we all deserve, the place our users deserve, the place the world deserves, but to do that, Googlers need to know," Berland said at the rally. "What are the executives so afraid of? What have we yet to ﬁnd out?"
A group of 20 workers showed up at Berland's meeting with investigators to provide support. The investigators, Berland said, asked him who they were and about others he discussed his workplace concerns with.
Friday's protests mark the latest escalation in tensions between employees and management at Google, a rift that broke into the open with the November 2018 walkout.
As The Times reported, that event reflected a widespread feeling that Google's long-established corporate culture of extreme internal transparency is breaking down as Google matures from Silicon Valley start-up to global behemoth.
Even as Google increasingly embraces conventional corporate norms, its empowered workers continue to expect a say in its decision-making and the high degree of on-the-job freedom they've long enjoyed.
Several employees previously told The Times that the company has become cagier in its communications with workers since the walkout, although a spokeswoman said the company remains among the world's most transparent.
In the last two months, Google has announced it would hold fewer "TGIF" all-hands meetings due to leaks, has taken down message board memes that criticized the hiring of a former Department of Homeland Security staffer, and has deleted questions during an all-staff meeting about that hiring.
It also put in place new rules that limit the kinds of political speech employees can engage in on company time.
Meanwhile, efforts to organize workers, while embryonic, are beginning to find pockets of traction. In Zurich, employees recently held a meeting to discuss their rights as workers and what unionizing would entail in defiance of Google's repeated attempts to cancel the event.
Employees also accused the company of creating an internal tool that kept tabs on organizing efforts by automatically reporting staffers who created a calendar event that included more than 10 rooms or 100 or more participants.
Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Google hired IRI Consultants, a law firm that specializes in anti-union tactics.
According to that report, employees learned of IRI's hiring by examining the calendar of a human resources official.
Berland and Rivers are not the first activist workers to say Google retaliated against them. Others have included walkout organizers Claire Stapleton and Meredith Whittaker, who left in June after Stapleton was demoted and Whittaker was told her role would significantly change; Irene Knapp, who departed in September; and Liz Fong-Jones, who gave notice in January.
When previously asked about these employees' claims, Google said it does not comment on individual cases but always investigates claims of retaliation and noted that employees are regularly reassigned or reorganized in response to evolving business needs.
At Friday's rally, Berland cast the departures as Google making examples of some workers to send a message to their colleagues.
"This isn't really about me, or Rebecca, or any individual," Berland said. "They are retaliating against us because they want to intimidate everyone who dares to disagree with leadership.... They want us afraid, and they want us silent."
After the public rally wrapped up, many of the employees filed into the company's cafeteria to lobby co-workers to support Berland and Rivers.
Organizers of the rally gave the company until next week to reinstate the two employees, at which point they will "take it to the next level," Parker said in her speech.
However the company responds, with Google workers increasingly taking their grievances public, it's unlikely to be the last word.

Let’s not allow contemporary Luddites to denigrate cultural innovation

Texto completo: Martin Scorsese has doubled down on his claim that Marvel movies are “not cinema” in a recent op-ed in The New York Times, an argument which previously receiving support from fellow filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola claims they are “despicable.”
As I sit and write I am not going to compare “The Godfather” with “Avengers: Infinity War. But if The Godfather Part III” taught us anything, it was that Francis Ford Coppola is incapable himself of creating a cinematic universe like that of Marvel.
We can ridicule the latest successful round of popcorn flicks all we wish, but just as “The Sopranos” relaxed the constraint on the complexity and length of plotlines for television, cinematic universes are relaxing the constraint that we can only watch characters as they exist in the boundaries of a handful of linear sequels. Maybe we should see where relaxing that constraint takes us.
Scorsese and Coppola, of course, aren’t the first entrenched interest to complain about new, successful competitors who do things differently.
As Bill James has documented, literally every generation of baseball players complains about the one that follows. Outfielder Jayson Werth, as he was stepping away from professional baseball in 2018, complained about “super nerds” ruining baseball, this despite today’s players are working more and more closely with team analytics to improve themselves. Or, you could tune in to the relentless complaints of Hall of Fame pitcher John Smoltz about baseball today during his color commentary of last month’s playoffs.
We have a word for those opposing technology and progress: Luddism, named after 19th century factory workers who were concerned that new machines would take their jobs, and responded by destroying the machines. The workers benefited in the short run by keeping their jobs, but it was at the expense of society overall.
In a chapter from my forthcoming book, “Markets against Modernity,” I argue we should recognize the non-violent form of Luddism practiced by those like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Jayson Werth, and John Smoltz as Social Luddism. Social Luddites act anti-socially as well.
Other examples abound. Ray Bradbury’s intention in writing “Fahrenheit 451” was not to decry censorship. It was to complain about the competition his books now faced in the form of television. Elsewhere, as has been widely reported, expertise in drinking wine is a “skill” that does not actually exist when it is subjected to double blind testing, but don’t ask the wine experts themselves about that.
More provocatively, why is it the case in every field of human achievement — from film to philosophy to whatever else you can think of— its highest peak supposedly occurred decades or centuries ago? If we think about it for a second, to the contrary, there are more people today pursuing greatness in virtually each and every one of those fields of achievement, often with the benefit of modern technology.
Why aren’t these fields improving? Whenever we can actually measure whether something is improving over time, as a rule, it is. Think of the accuracy of physics, or Olympic record times.
Perhaps cultural pessimists are Social Luddites personally invested in the importance of the past.
Consider this from another vantage point. For every opioid crisis or new civil war we hear about, there are far more examples of things getting better in the world, as documented by a variety of data-literate sources, such as Steven Pinker’s Enlightenment Now or the Cato Institute’s humanprogress.org. For the overwhelming majority of social indicators, if we can measure it, it is clearly getting better, overall.
It would take a bizarre conspiracy orchestrated by the universe if whatever we can’t currently measure directly is getting worse, even though the vast majority of social indicators, from GDP per capita to infant mortality rates, is improving.
Those who have the loudest cultural voices, like Coppola and Smoltz, may be blinding us from enjoying the wonders of the world in 2019, for the simple reason that they stand to personally profit by denigrating what is new. Don’t let them.
Ryan H. Murphy (rhmurphy@smu.edu) is a senior research fellow at SMU Dallas in the Cox School of Business. His forthcoming book, “Markets against Modernity” will be published by Lexington Books.

Fox News Anchor Who Broke Away Gives $500,000 to Press Freedom Group

Texto completo: A Committee to Protect Journalists event, where he also gave a speech, was the anchor's first public appearance since he abruptly left the network.
In his first public remarks since abruptly resigning from Fox News last month, the anchor Shepard Smith called on Thursday for a steadfast defense of independent journalism, while offering a few subtle barbs at President Trump's treatment of the press.
And in a surprise announcement, Mr. Smith said he would personally donate $ 500,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group that advances press freedoms around the world.
"Intimidation and vilification of the press is now a global phenomenon. We don't have to look far for evidence of that," Mr. Smith said at the group's annual dinner in Midtown Manhattan, an appearance he signed up for before he left Fox News, his television home of 23 years.
The crowd at the black-tie fund-raiser -- which draws leading reporters, editors and executives from across the media industry -- rose to its feet and applauded after Mr. Smith revealed his donation.
The dinner, formally known as the International Press Freedom Awards, recognized journalists who had persevered through hardship and government oppression in Brazil, India, Nicaragua and Tanzania. Mr. Smith served as M.C., and while he did not mention Mr. Trump by name, his remarks brought knowing nods from the crowd at the Grand Hyatt hotel ballroom.
"Our belief a decade ago that the online revolution would liberate us now seems a bit premature, doesn't it?" Mr. Smith said in his customary Mississippi lilt. "Autocrats have learned how to use those same online tools to shore up their power. They flood the world of information with garbage and lies, masquerading as news. There's a phrase for that."
Mr. Smith's experience at Fox News was a far cry from those of the honorees, who faced censorship, intimidation and imprisonment. But the anchor can relate to being the subject of insults and ire from a head of state.
Mr. Trump made Mr. Smith into a favorite punching bag, taunting him as Fox News's "lowest-rated anchor" and routinely complaining about his coverage of the White House. Mr. Smith had not hesitated to attack the president on the air, calling him out for falsehoods and denouncing his harsh language.
In his speech on Thursday, Mr. Smith refrained from addressing his time at Fox News or the network's coverage of the Trump administration. Fox News was a main sponsor of the dinner, and several of the network's journalists attended, including the White House correspondent John Roberts.
Speaking broadly, Mr. Smith called for unity in the news business to ward off government encroachment on free expression.
"We know that journalists are sometimes wary of being perceived as activists for some cause," he said. "But press freedom is not the preserve of one political group or one political party. It's a value embedded in our very foundational documents. Journalists need to join hands to defend it."
At Fox News, Mr. Smith's criticism of Mr. Trump stood out, and he was even mocked on-air by a colleague, the commentator Tucker Carlson. Mr. Smith, 55, had joined Fox News as part of its founding staff in 1996. But he became increasingly disillusioned in recent months about the gap between the network's prime-time commentary and the reporting produced by its newsroom.
His exit shocked colleagues, with some visibly agape on-air after Mr. Smith informed viewers that Fox News had agreed to let him out of his contract early. The decision most likely cost Mr. Smith millions of dollars in lost salary.
The Committee to Protect Journalists, founded in 1981, works to advance press freedoms, particularly in dictatorial and autocratic countries. In recent years, speakers at its gala have increasingly referred to Mr. Trump's attacks on the press and the hostile atmosphere faced by American journalists.
On Thursday, the group presented its Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award to Zaffar Abbas, the editor of a daily Pakistani newspaper, Dawn. The other honorees were Patrícia Campos Mello, a journalist at a Brazilian publication, Folha de S. Paulo; Neha Dixit, a freelance investigative journalist in India; two Nicaraguan broadcast journalists, Lucía Pineda Ubau and Miguel Mora, who faced imprisonment; and Maxence Melo Mubyazi, a journalist in Tanzania.
The chairs of the dinner were Laurene Powell Jobs, whose Emerson Collective controls the magazine The Atlantic and has made major investments in media companies, and one of her top executives, Peter Lattman, a former journalist at The New York Times.

Texto completo: President Trump wants an aggressive defense, but White House officials and Republicans are divided over whether to aim for a brief process or a drawn-out spectacle.
WASHINGTON -- The White House and the Republicans in the Senate, all but certain that the House will move forward to impeach President Trump, are divided over whether to embrace a lengthy trial that could give his allies a chance to mount an elaborate defense of his conduct before a polarized nation, or to move quickly to dispense with charges against him.
Several Republican senators discussed the issue with some of Mr. Trump's top aides on Thursday during a meeting at the White House that unfolded as the House Intelligence Committee capped off two weeks of public impeachment hearings exploring whether the president should be impeached on charges of pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals.
The group, which included some of Mr. Trump's closest allies in the Senate and his legal and political advisers, came to no final conclusions about what a person briefed on the matter said would be a "totally unpredictable" situation as all 100 senators meet in public session for only the third time in history to consider whether to remove a president from office.
One White House official said nothing would be resolved until closer to the time of the actual trial. Another person familiar with the White House position said that they believe there should not be a vote in the House and that they considered the inquiry illegitimate, but that they welcomed the chance to present witnesses and try the case, which they cannot do in the current setting.
Mr. Trump has told friends that he is eager to see Senate Republicans aggressively argue that he did nothing wrong, after an elaborate House impeachment proceeding that has featured a constant barrage of damaging Democratic allegations.
But some lawmakers, including Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, are pushing for a quick trial -- perhaps as short as two weeks, according to people familiar with the meeting. They hope that a brief proceeding would limit the political damage to Mr. Trump and quickly lead to his acquittal, allowing him and the Republican Party to focus on winning the 2020 election.
Others believe that drawing a trial out for as long as a month early next year could bring political advantages to Republicans, especially if it forces several Democratic senators who are running for president to make a difficult choice between sitting in their seats during an impeachment trial or spending time with voters on the campaign trail in Iowa and New Hampshire.
On Thursday, Mr. Graham sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo requesting documents that could signal which witnesses Republicans might call during an impeachment trial and how his allies might seek to defend the president.
In the letter, Mr. Graham asked for documents and communications with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., his son Hunter Biden, officials from the Obama administration and former President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. The list suggests that Mr. Graham envisions a defense of Mr. Trump that focuses on shifting attention away from Mr. Trump's conduct and onto the issue of whether Hunter Biden's work on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president was appropriate.
House Republicans unsuccessfully tried to persuade the Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry to subpoena Hunter Biden.
A longer trial might help a handful of moderate Republican senators who are eager to show independent voters that they are taking the allegations against Mr. Trump seriously. For those senators, a quick dismissal could be seen as a decision to condone the president's actions and sweep them under the rug without due consideration. Republican leaders have told Mr. Trump that they do not believe they could get the 51 votes required to quickly dismiss potential articles of impeachment.
Mr. Trump himself is a wild card, according to several people familiar with his thinking about how to handle a trial that appears all but inevitable.
At some moments, the president has told people close to him that he wants to see a lengthy trial in which his defenders are given the opportunity to call witnesses and deliver speeches on his behalf. But at other times, as he watches a torrent of negative news on cable television, he has said he wants a quick end to a process that he finds intolerable.
On Thursday morning, he complained on Twitter about coverage of what he called the "phony Impeachment Hoax," accusing the news media of failing to fairly report about the impeachment hearings. "FAKE & CORRUPT NEWS!"
In a separate lunch meeting with a group of eight senators on Thursday, including some who have signaled an openness to the impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump made brief comments about his frustration with the process, but did not ask for any commitments and did not discuss the procedures that a trial might follow, according to a statement from Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine.
"He feels that whatever has come forward has been exactly what he says -- useless," Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, told reporters after returning from the lunch.
Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who has been one of the few members of the president's party to criticize Mr. Trump's conduct on Ukraine, attended the lunch but said Mr. Trump shook his hand and did not mention the comments about his conduct.
The staff-level discussions with the senators on Thursday focused on the variety of ways that a Senate trial could play out and decisions that Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, will eventually have to make about the rules that will govern it.
Those rules, which were last developed for the impeachment trial of former President Bill Clinton in early 1999, govern how the two sides present evidence, whether they can call witnesses, and what role senators would have as they serve as quasi-jurors on the Senate floor. The answers to those questions -- which would have to be negotiated with Democratic senators -- would affect how long a trial would last.
In Mr. Clinton's case, senators agreed that Republicans could only call three witnesses to make their case against the president, making the trial much shorter than it might have been if they were allowed to present a longer case.
In recent weeks, Mr. Trump -- who frequently calls Republican lawmakers to comment on their television appearances -- has begun reaching out to them by inviting small groups of senators to the White House for lunch. While the meetings have not been billed as pertaining to a certain topic, the impeachment inquiry has come up. Mr. Trump has also had Republican lawmakers review transcripts of both of his phone calls with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, before either call was released to the public for the first time.
Mr. Trump has also weighed in with his impressions of the House proceedings, and discussed strategy during the lunches.
"They're just waiting for the House thing to play out," said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, who attended a lunch last week.

Texto completo: We're supposed to refer to the endless slew of bureaucrats testifying in the impeachment proceeding as "patriots" and "public servants." But are we allowed to wonder whether they're stupid?
Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill apparently doesn't understand that it's possible more than one country interfered in the 2016 election. In fact, we know that at least two did.
In her opening statement Thursday, Hill denied that Ukraine had inserted itself in that election with the explicit purpose of harming President Trump's campaign.
"Based on questions and statements I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country — and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did," she said. "This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves."
Who is she talking about? Not a single person on the House Intelligence Committee has denied that Russia meddled in the election. Republicans have, however, rightfully noted Ukraine's involvement and Trump's reasonable resentment over it.
Does Hill know it's possible to believe that both Russia and Ukraine were trying to influence the outcome of the election? It doesn't have to be one or the other. The New York Times and Politico both reported on Ukraine's interference at the time. It's a matter of public record. Why does Hill deny that it happened?
Maybe she's a patriot, but maybe she's also not very smart.

Paro nacional en Colombia: los 4 motivos detrás de la tensa protesta contra el gobierno de Duque

Texto completo: Con las fronteras del país cerradas y las fuerzas militares en máxima alerta, Colombia vivió este jueves una masiva jornada de protestas convocadas por opositores del presidente Iván Duque y su gobierno.
Las centrales obreras y movimientos sindicales que llamaron a la protesta lo calificaron como “paro nacional” y se registraron protestas en Bogotá y otras grandes ciudades como Medellín, Cali y Barranquilla.
Las protestas comenzaron con marchas pacíficas, si bien se produjeron enfrentamientos entre las fuerzas del orden y los manifestantes en algunos puntos del país.
En la capital, donde la jornada terminó con un cacerolazo, durante el día se registraron fuertes disturbios tanto en el centro como en el noroeste, donde algunos manifestantes intentaron dirigirse al aeropuerto internacional El Dorado.
Otros disturbios se produjeron en Cali, donde el alcalde, Maurice Armitage, decretó el toque de queda en la ciudad a partir de las 7 de la noche de este jueves tras los actos vandálicos registrados en varios puntos de la ciudad.
Debido a los disturbios y hechos violentos ocurridos hoy en la ciudad, el alcalde @MauriceArmitage ha decretado toque de queda entre las 7:00 p.m. de hoy y las 6:00 a.m. de mañana. Las personas que estén por fuera en este lapso, serán detenidas por las autoridades. pic.twitter.com/v69iEvrltp
— Alcaldía de Cali (@AlcaldiaDeCali) November 21, 2019
El gobierno implementó de forma previa una serie de medidas para evitar los disturbios en el país, entre ellas el cierre desde primera hora de este miércoles y hasta las 5:00 de la mañana del viernes de los pasos fronterizos de Colombia con Venezuela, Brasil, Ecuador y Perú.
Además se ordenó el acuartelamiento en primer grado (máxima alerta) de las fuerzas militares.
No obstante, se sumaron otros colectivos así como más reivindicaciones que hacen que desde 1977 no se viviera en el país tanta tensión por un paro nacional.
Duque, por su parte, ya en horas de la noche, se refirió a los “actos de violencia atribuibles a vándalos que no representan el espíritu de quienes marcharon”.
“Los hechos sucedidos con posterioridad a la marcha son vandalismo puro y no obedecen a una expresión de la voluntad popular”, aseguró el presidente.
El mandatario también afirmó que habían sido detenidos “decenas de criminales” a los que van a “aplicarles todo el peso de la ley”.
* Paro nacional en Colombia: por qué la protesta del 21 de noviembre genera tanta tensión
Y sobre el fondo de la protesta, aseguró que el suyo es un gobierno “que escucha y construye”.
“El diálogo social ha sido la bandera principal de este gobierno. Debemos profundizarlo con todos los sectores de nuestra sociedad y acelerar nuestra agenda social y de lucha contra la corrupción”, afirmó.
Estas son algunas de las razones de la protesta.
Las organizaciones sociales también reclaman al gobierno un mayor compromiso con la implementación del acuerdo de paz con las FARC alcanzado en 2016.
En particular, y relacionado con el punto anterior, critican duramente lo que consideran un incumplimiento por parte del gobierno respecto al punto 4 del acuerdo que habla de la sustitución gradual y voluntaria de los cultivos de uso ilícito por otras alternativas de subsistencia para las comunidades más pobres.
Esto, según los expertos, está contribuyendo a la crisis de inseguridad que vive población indígena en el país.
En abril de este año, Duque presentó seis cuestionamientos a la ley de la justicia para la paz , lo que le provocó una ola de críticas e incluso protestas callejeras.
Aquella decisión, que fue sugerida por Álvaro Uribe apenas unos días antes, provocó que defensores del acuerdo con la exguerrilla FARC acusaran al mandatario de “permitir morir la paz” y de ser tildado por columnistas como “subpresidente”.
* 5 claves para entender la grave crisis política en Colombia y por qué acusan a Duque de “estar dispuesto a dejar morir la paz”
Por otro lado, recientemente se han llevado a cabo operaciones contra la disidencia de las FARC . En la última, en un caso que estremeció a la sociedad colombiana, al menos ocho menores de edad (algunos medios hablan de 18) murieron en un operativo de las fuerzas de seguridad a un campamento guerrillero.
La muerte de los menores , incluida una niña de 12 años, un adolescente de 15 años y otra menor de 16, había sido ocultada por el gobierno -que solo había hablado de una impecable y exitosa operación- pero fue revelada en el congreso, costándole el puesto al ministro de Defensa Guillermo Botero.
* Guillermo Botero dimite en medio de la polémica por la operación militar en que murieron varios menores
Las críticas contra Botero se habían agravado en mayo pasado cuando un reportaje de The New York Times revelaba que el alto mando ordenó a los militares que doblaran “el número de criminales y guerrilleros que matan, capturan o fuerzan a rendirse en combate (y posiblemente admitiendo un mayor número de víctimas civiles)”.
Esto hizo recordar directivas similares que, durante el gobierno de Álvaro Uribe Vélez, condujerom a la ejecución por parte del ejército de miles de jóvenes que luego fueron presentados como guerrilleros, en lo que se conoció como los “falsos positivos”.
.
La combinación de estos factores han generado un clima de descontento con el gobierno de Duque, cuya popularidad pasa por sus horas más bajas desde su llegada al gobierno en agosto de 2018.
* Un año de Iván Duque en el poder: “Subpresidente”, la pesada carga del presidente de Colombia por ser el elegido de Álvaro Uribe
Una encuesta de la empresa Gallup correspondiente a octubre de 2019 ubicó el nivel de desaprobación de Duque en 69%, mientras que su aprobación era de 26%.
Por lo que este paro nacional representa, para Duque, una de las pruebas más difíciles hasta ahora en su mandato.

3 Pa. teams on MLB's minor league cut list

Texto completo: Back in October, it was rumored that there could be some drastic changes coming to the world of professional baseball when reports surfaced that the MLB proposed to cut ties with 42 of its minor league teams after the 2020 season.
At the time, no minor league teams were named. That changed over the weekend when a New York Times report released the extensive list of teams that are on the chopping block, putting a face to the harsh reality that more than three dozen cities across the United States could lose their minor league team, and thousands of players could end up unemployed.
Three Pennsylvania teams are on that list to possibly lose their MLB affiliation. Those teams are the Eastern League's Erie SeaWolves, a AA affiliate of the Detroit Tigers; the New York-Penn League's State College Spikes, a single-A St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, and the Williamsport Crosscutters, a single-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies.
The MLB believes the cuts are necessary to improve facilities and make the minor leagues more efficient, according to reports from the Times. But the three teams at risk in Pennsylvania arguably shouldn't have problems with their facilities.
The SeaWolves, who play out of UPMC Park in downtown Erie, installed a brand new baseball field last year along with two "state-of-the art" video boards, according to team president Greg Coleman. The stadium is also currently making $12 million worth of renovations this off-season, which includes the installation of climate-controlled batting cages.
The Spikes have played in State College since 2006. They play homes games and are tenants of Penn State's Medlar Field at Lubrano Park, which is owned by the university and shared by the Nittany Lions baseball program. The field is the newest addition to the minor league scene and has a capacity of 5,406.
The team brought in 119,120 fans in 2019 with an average of 3,219 per game, which was fourth among teams in the New York-Penn League.
The Crosscutters' stadium, BB&T Park, has played host to MLB teams for the annual Little League Classic since 2017. The game, held during the Little League World Series in Williamsport and entering its fourth year, will pit the Boston Red Sox against the Baltimore Orioles in 2020.
Is this really a 'death sentence'? The Times reported that cuts could be a "death sentence" for these teams. The loss of major-league affiliation could significantly diminish a team's value in the community and derail players' career-goals or employment opportunities.
Gov. Tom Wolf said he is hopeful that any final decisions made on this proposal will only be made after consulting with local representatives about any impacts to the local economies.
"Pennsylvania's professional baseball affiliates help provide affordable family-friendly entertainment and improve the quality of life in each of their communities," Wolf said in a statement to the York Daily Record Monday night. "I strongly urge the MLB to keep its commitments to local fans, which helps ensure future generations of fans for the sport."
Erie team 'helps keep the downtown vibrant' Erie SeaWolves President Greg Coleman said it's too early to view the proposal as anything more than preliminary conversations between the major and minor leagues.
The team was founded in 1989 and has been playing in Erie since 1995. They were previously an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1995 to 1998, and the Anaheim Angels from 1999 to 2000, but have been reaffiliated with the Tigers for the past 18 years.
Coleman said he doesn't anticipate the news affecting the $12 million in renovations underway at UPMC Park.
"We haven't seen the overall plan. It's a proposal," Coleman said. "We aren't going to stop work on a plan we've been executing for 5 years because of a proposal we heard about a few weeks ago."
Mayor Joe Schember said major league affiliation or not, it's important for the Erie community to have a baseball team.
Having the SeaWolves stadium located in downtown Erie, has been a positive contribution to the local economy — "it helps keep the downtown vibrant," Schember said.
"To use a baseball saying — it's very early in the first inning. And it's been an exciting first inning, but it's the first inning," Coleman said. "We've got a long way to go before it's the bottom of the ninth."
State College Spikes attract residents, visitors Spikes communications director Joe Putnam did not return a phone call seeking comment Monday. He declined comment to multiple media outlets based in State College.
The Spikes previously were an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates from 2007 to 2012 but have been reaffiliated with the Cardinals for the past seven years.
Minor League Baseball and State College mayor Donald Hahn also did not respond to requests for comment.
Fritz Smith, the president and CEO for Happy Valley Adventure Bureau, said he is "very hopeful that this scenario does not come to pass." Happy Valley Adventure Bureau is a nonprofit that works to develop "economic activity and quality of life" in Centre County and State College.
"The Spikes are an important part of our community," Smith said in an emailed statement. "They offer a family friendly, affordable activity. We believe that Centre County, with a growing resident base, alongside a growing visitor base, merits having a minor league franchise."
Williamsport Crosscutters Thus far, the Williamsport Crosscutters also seem to be taking a wait-and-see approach to the reports, telling fans "nothing has or will be decided in this process for a very long time" in a statement released on social media.
"Further to that, as MLB has stated publicly, their main concerns are around facility standards and significant distance of some clubs from their affiliates (neither of which apply to the Crosscutters) so this is just a natural process of negotiation on behalf of all 160 Minor League baseball teams," reads the organization's statement.
The Crosscutters also confirmed the club will continue serving as a Phillies affiliate for the 2020 season and says meetings are planned to discuss extending that agreement.
BB&T Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field, the home of the Williamsport Crosscutters, also hosts an annual MLB Little League Classic game in August when the Little League World Series is in town.

Texto completo: A French thriller series about a Parisian orchestra hits Topic. And Vanessa Hudgens stars in "The Knight Before Christmas" on Netflix.
What's Streaming
PHILHARMONIA Stream on Topic. Common: A thriller that uses classical music to ramp up tension. Less common: A thriller whose plot revolves around classical music. But both of those attributes apply to this French series, about a fictional Paris orchestra. It begins with the orchestra's conductor dropping dead midconcert. His replacement, Hélène (Marie-Sophie Ferdane), is a hot shot with a mysterious past who flies from New York to Paris with a handgun in her luggage. The drama begins when Hélène starts making radical changes at the orchestra, like replacing the lead violinist with a young protégée. What follows is a tense story that involves sex, blood and Vivaldi. It will debut in North America on Thursday on a revamped version of the website and streaming platform Topic, alongside the Italian mystery series THE MIRACLE. That show, created by the author Niccolò Ammaniti, centers on the discovery of a statue of the Virgin Mary that weeps blood.
THE KNIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS (2019) Stream on Netflix. If a medieval knight materialized before your very eyes, what would you do? For Brooke, the jaded young science teacher that Vanessa Hudgens plays in this movie, the answer is help him adjust to modern life, then fall in love with him. That's the premise of this romantic comedy, which is the second Netflix holiday movie with Hudgens as a star in two years. Josh Whitehouse plays opposite Hudgens as the medieval man, who is thrown into modern times during an episode of apparent time travel. (He should probably seek a shower and a flu shot before anything else.) The wintery activities this pair engages in include hacking down a Christmas tree and baking -- with King Arthur flour, naturally.
3:10 TO YUMA (2007) Stream on Showtime platforms; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The director James Mangold had a box office hit last weekend with "Ford v Ferrari," an auto-racing drama with Matt Damon and Christian Bale. No fast cars appear in this Western from Mangold, though Bale is here -- and there may be a mustang or two. A remake of the 1957 film of the same name (itself based on an Elmore Leonard short story), "3:10 to Yuma" stars Bale as a rancher and Civil War veteran who joins a group tasked with transporting a dangerous outlaw (played by Russell Crowe) across Arizona. This version "expands the story and cranks up the brutality," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, but it "does its best to honor the unpretentious spirit of the original."

Texto completo: Readers praise the honesty, courage and patriotism of those who have appeared as witnesses at the impeachment hearings. To the Editor:
Re "'We Followed the President's Orders' to Pressure Ukraine, Sondland Says" (nytimes.com, Nov. 20):
All this impeachment investigation needed was one person on the inside to tell the truth, even though any rational person knew from the evidence that this was always a conspiracy with Donald Trump as the prime mover.
Gordon Sondland's testimony should shake loose the truth from others with direct access to Mr. Trump. The world will come to understand that what happened was not a wild idea of Rudolph Giuliani, but a conspiracy known about and implemented by the Trump administration.

To the Editor:
Re "Two Top Officials Testify Call Was Inappropriate; One 'Couldn't Believe' It" (front page, Nov. 20):
The most memorable comment during the impeachment hearings on Tuesday came from Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman when, after acknowledging the risk he was taking by opposing the president, he was asked by Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, "Why do you have confidence that you can do that, and tell your dad not to worry?" "Because this is America," he replied. "And here, right matters."
Colonel Vindman's response was all the more moving for its spontaneity and its obvious conviction, even after Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee had tried to impugn his integrity and patriotism and the White House had issued, yet again during a hearing, a demeaning tweet.
As we go forward as a nation, may we never forget his words and personal example: "This is America. ... And here, right matters."

To the Editor:
Re "The Courses Pompeo Failed at West Point," by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 20):
I wish to applaud Mr. Friedman on his article about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. As a West Point graduate and retired Army officer, I am appalled at Mr. Pompeo's failure to speak truth to power to the president, and to defend the honor and reputation of career Foreign Service officers such as Marie Yovanovitch.
Mr. Pompeo should look to the moral courage being displayed by Ambassador Bill Taylor as an example of how to conduct himself, rather than stoop to the level of President Trump, a man totally devoid of honor and integrity.
Charles S. Lewis

To the Editor:
Is good, old-fashioned political revenge no longer in fashion in Washington? Representative Adam Schiff is acting as if he's shocked that President Trump would try to get back at the Democrats by giving them a taste of their own medicine, by going after Joe Biden and his son on the same charge of quid pro quo that they are bringing against him. Do they want to root out corruption? They can start by looking for it in their own backyard.
Mr. Trump may not have the purest of motives, but nothing he has done rises to the level of criminal misconduct. In fact, I would say it's just business as usual in Washington and, sadly, the way of the world. Is there anything impeachable about it? Don't make me laugh.

Impeaching the media

Texto completo: As the second week of the impeachment hearings began, Republicans reintroduced an old theme for the usual purposes: Everything is the media's fault, and America wouldn't be in this jam but for journalists being puppets of the Democratic Party.
Such were the sentiments expressed by Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, during his opening statement Tuesday morning. Nunes was obviously trying to create a backdrop for the day's testimony, which included such witnesses as an Iraq War combat veteran who was wounded in battle and an aide to Vice President Pence. It's much harder to demonize such highly respected individuals than it is to drag out the media for yet another lashing.
If you had just tuned in from your interplanetary travels, however, you might have thought the media, not President Trump, was the subject of the impeachment inquiry. It was stale bread. Making an enemy of the media has long been a feature of Trump's modus operandi. From his earliest campaign days, the then-future leader of the free world created an enemy to divert attention from his more problematic escapades and as a target to use when needed.
From alleged collusion with Russia to supposed bribery with Ukraine, the media has been performing as instruments of the Democratic Party, according to Nunes. He illustrated his point Tuesday by listing a series of headlines from various media outlets, including CNN, the New York Times, Slate and others (but not The Post), all of which had been proved incorrect. It was effective as a diversion, if not as the filtering lens he surely sought to create.
To Trump's base, the Nunes roster was simply further amplification of what it has long believed and for which it is conjoined with the president in a political matrimony of sorts. And though it is true that the media, by which we mean human beings, sometimes gets things wrong, it is also likely that Nunes's team scoured the print and broadcast universe for mistaken headlines. A half-dozen or so examples do not a conspiracy of misinformation make. Is that all you got?
This is not to excuse careless journalism or what legitimately appears to be bias against Trump but to offer some balance. Without question, certain folks, especially on cable-news shows, have picked sides. That's what they do. The incessant, looping criticism contra the president can seem like an onslaught of unfair proportions. As a spectator, I agree that the steady diet of smirk and scorn becomes tiresome and, frankly, boring. Television gets an unfair proportion of audiences because, well, it's television. Watching is easier than reading.
But a careful reading of a broad spectrum of readily available ideas and investigative journalism might prove valuable to those wishing to understand the reasoning behind the critique. There is ample cause to call out this president, from a self-regard that seems detached from reality to his dubious courtship of bad actors.
As to the impeachment inquiry, it is difficult to fathom how anyone would not see a problem with the president of the United States soliciting a foreign country to investigate his political opponent in exchange for promised military aid.
Other avenues for such an investigation, if warranted, would be both more credible and less risky. But Trump specifically wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to make a public announcement that he was conducting such an investigation, according to testimony on Wednesday by Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union. Also, Sondland said, the quid pro quo of a White House invite in exchange for the investigation was obvious, even if Trump never said the words.
The only question remaining is whether Trump's actions justify impeachment, the answer to which seems plainly partisan. Americans have had numerous opportunities over the past three years to ask how Republican elected officials could still support such a president. Almost nostalgically, one recalls the days when, innocently, one would think: Surely, this time they'll jump ship?
Of course, they didn't " and likely won't this time for the simple reason that their constituents aren't demanding it. And, by the way, they hate the media, too.
Nunes's blame-the-media tactic, however, should be seen for what it was " a desperate act in the face of credible, damning testimony.
For an alternative media narrative, one might entertain the possibility that when, say, a conservative columnist agrees with the Democrats, they might both be right.

Texto completo: WHITEHALL TOWNSHIP
4 charged in drug sting, DA says
An eight-month Lehigh County Drug Task Force investigation, involving a Whitehall Township car wash, has led to four arrests and the seizure of 2.8 kilos of heroin and fentanyl, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said.
Arrested Monday were Brian Badia, 29, of the 400 block of Washington Street, along with Julio De La Cruz, 23, and Ruddy Leonor-Severino, 35, both of the 1000 block of Linden Street, all of Allentown. Also arrested was Raymundo Reyes, 29, who has no current address.
In March, task force members began buying heroin and the painkiller, fentanyl, from employees of the Champion Hand Car Wash on MacArthur Road, Whitehall Township, and at other locations in Whitehall and Allentown, Martin said. Seven drug purchases were made in the last eight months, Martin said.
Task force members served two search warrants Monday at the homes of Badia, De La Cruz and Leonor-Severino. Authorities seized the drugs, two semi-automatic pistols, two vehicles and a "substantial amount" of money, Martin said.
Badia, De La Cruz, Leonor-Severino and Reyes are charged with multiple counts of felony offenses including delivery of a controlled substance, conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance, conspiracy to possess with the intent to deliver a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance, along with misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia.
All four were in Lehigh County Jail as of Tuesday.

HELLERTOWN
Woman charged following hit-and-run, police say
A woman drove under the influence, hit two occupied vehicles and was followed by 911 callers while fleeing the scene Friday, Hellertown police said.
No one was injured in the 6:58 p.m. Friday incident in the 1500 block of Main Street. Melissa Powell, 41, of Hellertown, was arrested in Bethlehem, police said. Police said Powell violated her probation. She was arraigned Monday on DUI and other charges.
Powell was released on $25,000 unsecured bail.

SCHUYLKILL COUNTY
Whitehall Township man sentenced for child sexual assault
A Whitehall Township man will spend to 30 to 60 months behind bars for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Schuylkill County, court records show.
Brian L. Fisher, 54, will also be a registered sex offender under Megan's Law for the rest of his life. He was sentenced Nov. 15 on charges of aggravated indecent assault, corruption of minors, indecent assault and indecent exposure.
Fisher, of Van Buren Drive, pleaded no contest Oct. 14 before Schuylkill County President Judge William E. Baldwin.
State police at Schuylkill Haven said Fisher committed the offenses at Bearcat Cove, a vacation community in South Manheim Township, sometime between Jan. 1, 2017, and July 16, 2018.
In a no contest plea a defendant does not admit guilt but concedes that prosecutors have enough evidence to secure a conviction. It carries the same weight at sentencing as a guilty plea.
Fisher's attorney, Douglas Taglieri, did not return a phone message Tuesday. Schuylkill County Assistant District Attorney A.J. Serina was not available for comment.

BUCKS COUNTY
Dentist finds meth in assistant's pocket during root canal, police say
A dental assistant in Bucks County was charged with drug possession after a coworker found a bag of meth in her pocket at work, according to charging documents.
Cindy Lou Kametler, 33 of Whitehall, was assisting with a root canal at Upper Bucks Dental Arts on the 2100 block of Quaker Pointe Drive in Milford Township when the dentist made the discovery the afternoon of Oct. 23, the affidavit states.
At one point during the appointment, state police in Dublin say, the dentist told Kametler she needed a syringe. Seeing her hands full, the dentist reached into Kametler's front left pocket to grab the syringe but pulled out a plastic bag containing a white powdery substance along with the syringe, according to the affidavit.
The dentist took the baggie, telling police she suspected it was some type of drug. Kametler later went to the dentist's office to ask if she found a small baggie with "stuff" in it, but wouldn't tell the dentist what the stuff was, according to the criminal filing.
Police say Kametler showed signs of deception when interviewed, and changed her story. Lab tests later confirmed the substance in the bag was about half a gram of methamphetamine.
Kametler's preliminary hearing is scheduled for Dec. 17 before Magisterial District Judge Regina Armitage.

BETHLEHEM
Police: Woman left child alone in hotel so she could gamble
Authorities say a New Jersey woman left a 4-year-old girl alone in a hotel room while she gambled at the Wind Creek Casino in Bethlehem.
Police went to Wind Creek around 4 a.m. Saturday after the girl was found wandering alone in the casino's hotel lobby. The girl told the officers she was looking for Rebecca Yandoli, a 26-year-old Hunterdon County resident who was soon found gambling on the main floor of the casino.
Authorities say Yandoli told officers she had left the girl alone in the hotel room around 1:15 a.m. and then went to gamble. She's been charged with child endangerment.
It wasn't known Tuesday if Yandoli has retained an attorney. Authorities have said if she was related to the girl.

Democrats fail to hold NBC to account for sexual abuse, despite promising to do so

Texto completo: In light of multiple claims that NBC covered up allegations of sexual abuse and harassment, a handful of top Democratic candidates promised to confront the network and its parent company, Comcast, during Wednesday’s debate — yet another promise the Democrats failed to keep.

Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris demanded in a letter this week that the Democratic National Committee pressure MSNBC (the host of the fifth primary debate) and NBC to launch an independent investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. Unlike other networks that have faced similar allegations, NBC has refused to outsource its investigation and instead conducted its own internal review, prompting criticism from many of its own employees, including hosts Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes.

This was an important subject for many of the Democratic candidates — or so they said.

Out of all the candidates who signed the letter to the DNC, not one raised the issue on stage. The debate’s moderators even gave them the perfect opportunity to do so by specifically asking candidates to address the #MeToo movement and how it has affected women in the workplace. Still, not one mention of NBC and its culture of sexual harassment.

This was an important opportunity for Democrats to prove that their money is where their mouth is. Instead, they remained silent. One letter to the DNC is not enough. Women deserve accountability and justice, and they will not get it unless someone stands up for them. And to think: That someone could have been a Democrat.

Texto completo: At the time I wrote my 2016 review of “I Heard You Paint Houses” by Charles Brandt, I speculated that the 2016 version was without a doubt the “final version.”
It is not.
Fast forward to 2019 and the book, the same book, is now named “The Irishman,” and it sports a new Netflix cover.
In the second week of November, the book was No. 6 on The New York Times’ best seller list for paperback nonfiction. And last week, it was No. 1!
“The Irishman” is also the name of the movie based on the book. It premiered Sept. 27 at Lincoln Center in New York and has received nearly universal and lavish praise and acclaim as one of the best films ever! It is now playing in a select number of theaters through Nov. 27, when Netflix will make it available to its 166 million subscribers. Apparently the book, whatever you call it, will be numero uno for many weeks.
The road from publication to a cinematic masterpiece by Martin Scorsese has been 15 long years in the making: from publication of the book in May 2004; the sale of film rights to Paramount in October 2008; a four-hour NYC sit-down and review by the author, Scorsese, Robert De Niro and Steven Zaillian in August 2009. Then years of ... nothing.
In late 2017, filming began. In March 2018, the film was done, or wrapped, and the tedious process of de-aging of the actors began. Its premiere finally came in September after Netflix, not Paramount, wagered a cool $159 million to bring the movie to life. Thank you, Netflix.
Despite ample evidence of the veracity of the book (and the film it spawned), especially as to the central question, “Who killed James Riddle Hoffa?” there are doubters who claim the movie (and by implication, the book) is great cinema but a con job. Among them is the writer Dan Moldea, whose work Brandt ironically and generously acknowledges (page ix). Such uncharitable conduct brings to mind a line from the movie: “You might be demonstrating a failure to show appreciation.”
Full disclosure: I’ve seen the movie twice ... so far.

Texto completo: Amid reports Major League Baseball could cut ties with several minor league affiliates, the Hudson Valley Renegades are confident they will remain in Fishkill and operating as normal.
The New York Times reported that Major League Baseball has reportedly proposed severing ties with 42 minor league teams, mostly at the lowest levels – Rookie ball and short-season Class A.
The Renegades are the short-season Class A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays organization. But the team, which plays from mid-June to September each year at Dutchess Stadium in Fishkill, was not on a list of franchises, published Saturday by The New York Times, that would have their ties cut under the proposal.
Others in the New York-Penn League, in which the Renegades plays, were included.
"From a Renegades standpoint, we are confident we will be throwing out a first pitch on 2021 opening day at 'The Dutch,'" said Jeff Goldklang, president of the Goldklang Group, which owns the Renegades. "Who we are playing is to be determined. We are hoping Minor League Baseball will continue on as it has the past 100 or so years."
The Times reported Major League Baseball says reorganization is needed to make the minor leagues more efficient and to improve conditions and facilities. Major and Minor League Baseball's current Professional Baseball Agreement is set to expire after the 2020 season.
In addition to cutting the 42 minor league teams, which is approximately a quarter of the minor league teams under the current contract, other reported proposals would be to shift the baseball draft from June to August and limit the number of rounds.
Goldklang said the proposed changes are currently being negotiated, staing, "We're in the first inning of a nine-inning discussion."
He added that the Renegades are in a "wonderful market" and have maintained a great relationship with Major League Baseball since the team's 1994 inception.
Last December, the Dutchess County Legislature voted in favor of a $2.4 million bond to pay for repairs to Dutchess Stadium, a move that extended the county's agreement with the Renegades by five years.
Dutchess Stadium sits on land owned by the Beacon City School District. The county pays rent to Beacon for use of the land, and the Renegades pay rent to the county for use of the stadium.
Among the teams listed to potentially be eliminated are the Auburn Doubledays, the Connecticut Tigers, the Lowell Spinners, the Mahoning Valley Scrappers, the State College Spikes, the Staten Island Yankees, the Williamsport Crosscutters and the Vermont Lake Monsters. Each competes alongside the Renegades in the New York-Penn League.
It's yet to be seen what changes would be in store for the Renegades, should it remain in the Rays organization with the short-season division eliminated. Goldklang said he has "no knowledge" of any impact it could have on the length of the team's season.
Under the plan, a new "Dream League" would be operated by Major League Baseball at minimal cost and provide undrafted players an opportunity to break into professional baseball.
Sen. Charles Schumer on Monday asked MLB to reconsider.
"America's favorite pastime should not become part of Upstate New York's past," he said in a statement to the USA TODAY Network New York. "It's no secret that New York's minor league teams are institutions within their communities, which is why I implore MLB to reconsider any such plans and will be reaching out to them directly to advocate for our New York teams."
Why is MLB proposing to eliminate minor league teams? The proposed changes were first reported by Baseball America's J.J. Cooper in August, which came as part of the negotiation to renew an operating agreement between the minor and major leagues that expires at the end of the 2020 season.
For more than 100 years, minor league teams have negotiated affiliation agreements with big-league teams. The parent club provides funding and players to the minor league teams, which help train and develop young players who aspire to a major league career.
Cooper reported that MLB owners and team officials have long expressed concerns about the quality of playing facilities where many of the affiliates operate. They'd also like minor league teams to contribute more to player salaries.
But perhaps the biggest reason behind the proposed reductions is a shift in the way teams are thinking about player development, driven by the emergence of technology and data analytics.
As teams have adopted these tools, they've concluded that their current system is woefully inefficient. Travis Sawchik, a sports reporter for FiveThirtyEight, wrote in September about why the Houston Astros were among the teams who have reduced the number of minor league affiliates in recent years.
Team officials concluded that they need less time and fewer games to understand the potential of their young prospects, and it is better served by consolidating resources around their most promising players.
Teams have also shifted their development efforts off the field, using video analysis and other high-tech tools to help players improve their skills at their training facilities rather than by playing in regulation games. Many players have embraced these efforts on their own, turning to independent coaches and unaffiliated training facilities.
Sawchik and co-author Ben Lindbergh explored these changes in their best-selling book, "The MVP Machine: How Baseball's New Nonconformists Are Using Data to Build Better Players."
They describe a system where teams have traditionally poured in hundreds of players and millions of dollars each year in the hopes that a handful of those prospects will eventually emerge on the other end to help the big league team. The process seems mysterious from the outside, and in truth, the effort has often been more art than science.
"As far as many fans are concerned, players disappear after draft day," Sawchick and Lindbergh wrote, "encased in cocoons from which some emerge as beautiful baseball butterfiles, while most wither away, forever forgotten or, if they're particularly talented, lamenting for failing to molt."
Sawchik and Lindbergh said that the adoption of these new technologies has helped teams to realize they can get a competitive advantage by upending the way they develop players and shifting away from the minor league model they've relied on for the last century.
Making a list Jeff Lantz, Senior Director of Communications for Minor League Baseball said the sides will meet in upcoming weeks to negotiate a plan that would "save as many teams" as possible.
"From what we gathered from the MLB, they did a poll of which ballparks were better, which needed a lot of work and came up with a mass list," he said.
Lantz said an estimated 1,200 players would also lose their jobs should the proposal be approved.
"A lot would be released and have their dreams of being big-league players crushed," Lantz said. "We'll see how things shake out. Both sides want to get a deal done that benefits baseball."
However, the 2020 season is not in jeopardy and is scheduled to be played uninterrupted, he said.
"This is where people gather in the summertime, and it'd be very unfortunate to lose baseball in any of these communities," Lantz said. "Our communications team is looking to keep baseball in all 160 markets."

Texto completo: The attorneys general of New York and California filed lawsuits alleging that the company had targeted young people with deceptive advertising.
The attorneys general of New York and California announced lawsuits against Juul this week, alleging that the company deliberately marketed and sold vaping products to young people -- and helped create a public health crisis in the process.
The lawsuits allege that the company specifically targeted young people with deceptive advertising, featuring flavors like mango, cool mint, crème brûlée and cucumber. They charge that the company failed to warn customers that the products contain nicotine, misrepresented them as a safer alternative to cigarettes and illegally sold them to minors. The attorney general of North Carolina announced a similar lawsuit in May.
The New York suit, filed on Tuesday, stated that in 2015, the year Juul products went on the market, the company threw parties in New York City and the Hamptons, and debuted advertising campaigns featuring young models and hashtags like #LightsCameraVapor.
"By glamorizing vaping, while at the same time downplaying the nicotine found in vaping products, Juul is putting countless New Yorkers at risk," Attorney General Letitia James of New York said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
Juul Labs, which holds about 70 percent of the e-cigarette market and is the target of several federal investigations, has said that it has stopped accepting orders for most flavored pods in the United States and has suspended all broadcast, print and digital advertising nationwide.
"While we have not yet reviewed the complaint, we remain focused on resetting the vapor category in the U.S. and earning the trust of society by working cooperatively with attorneys general, regulators, public health officials and other stakeholders to combat underage use and convert adult smokers from combustible cigarettes," Austin Finan, a company spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday.
"Our customer base is the world's one billion adult smokers and we do not intend to attract underage users," Mr. Finan added.
The company, which is based in San Francisco, has come under intense scrutiny amid an outbreak of lung injuries and deaths linked to vaping. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state agencies have reported 2,172 lung injury cases and 43 deaths linked to vaping. More than 120 of the injured patients were under 18.
A majority of those cases involve people who said they had vaped THC, which Juul does not sell. But the illnesses highlighted how widespread vaping has become among American teenagers. A national health survey released in September found that a quarter of 12th-grade students said they had used nicotine vaping products in the last month.
Amid the rising uproar over vaping, which over the past decade had grown into a multibillion-dollar industry with little oversight, several states have moved to ban or restrict e-cigarettes, institute taxes or raise age limits.
President Trump, after saying in September that he was moving to ban sales of flavored e-cigarettes, retreated from the idea this month, under pressure from his political advisers and lobbyists.
On Friday, Apple removed 181 vaping apps from its online store. The ban affected apps that help people find vape stores or flavors; that allow users to control their vape pens; and that gave people access to games, news or social networks that promote vaping.
Medical experts caution that young people are especially susceptible to nicotine addiction, and that there is little research about the long-term health risks of vaping. They note that while many smokers turned to vaping to quit cigarettes, it has also created a new generation of young nicotine addicts.
"Juul adopted the tobacco industry's infamous playbook, employing advertisements that had no regard for public health and searching out vulnerable targets," Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California said in a statement announcing his state's lawsuit on Monday.

Yes, she's on 'Cartel Crew,' but ...; The wife of El Chapo doesn't want your judgment. Being on this series won't help.

Texto completo: Emma Coronel Aispuro, the wife of convicted Sinaloa Cartel chief Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, made her debut appearance on the VH1 "documentary" series "Cartel Crew" on Monday night.
Like the network's "Mob Wives," which ran for six seasons, and A&E's "Growing Up Gotti," "Cartel Crew" follows the adventures of the near relations of jailed or deceased organized crime figures. The premise here is that cast members -- mostly Miami-based sons and daughters of Latin American drug lords -- are trying to lead more honest lives than their parents, and though some have done time themselves, at the moment of filming they are all, strictly speaking, legit -- working straight jobs as stars of a reality TV show, trading their hot messiness for a sort of celebrity.
Although some eyebrows were raised when the episode -- or possibly, episodes -- was announced, including Sen. John Kennedy's (R-La.) call for VH1 to cancel the show, this is not new territory for television.

Netflix and Univision coproduced three seasons of the docudrama "El Chapo," which includes a fictionalized version of Coronel; and Guzman is a supporting character in "Narcos: Mexico," another Netflix production. (Alejandro Edda, who plays him on that series, attended Guzman's trial in February and got a wave from the defendant. "I was just paying respect to him," he told the New York Times.)
Also from Netflix: "The Day I Met El Chapo," a docuseries in which Mexican actress Kate del Castillo, who played a drug trafficker in the telenovela "La Reina del Sur," recounts her role in arranging for Sean Penn to interview Guzman for Rolling Stone. (An American version of that telenovela, USA's "Queen of the South," has been renewed for a fifth season.)
Our prurient interest in criminals is nothing new. (Shakespeare wrote some memorable monsters.) Neither is our uncertainty over how to regard them.
The folk song "Jesse James" celebrates the outlaw as a killer and a man of feeling in the same verse, just as Mexican narcocorridos tell tales of modern drug-running outlaws. (There are many about or from the point of view of El Chapo.)
"Scarface" was a hit for Paul Muni in 1932 and Al Pacino in 1983; Warren Beatty starred in sympathetic film biographies of Clyde Barrow (of "Bonnie and") and Bugsy Siegel. Martin Scorsese has directed significant energy toward putting organized crime on-screen in a way that effectively if not technically glamorizes it. Charles Manson -- don't get me started.
And, of course, there is "The Godfather," which gave one "Cartel Crew" star his name -- Michael Corleone Blanco, the son of "Cocaine Godmother" Griselda Blanco, who was deported to Colombia and killed there. Reportedly, there were three feature films and an HBO series in the works about her at the time.
Indeed, the shining edifice that is Platinum Age Television has been erected on the back of gangsters: "The Sopranos" -- without which there surely would have been no "Mob Wives" -- is routinely praised as the beginning of it all and the greatest series ever. (Unless it was "The Wire," routinely praised as the greatest series as well. Or "Breaking Bad," also routinely praised as the greatest series ever.)
Both "The Sopranos" and "Breaking Bad," as well as later entries like "Animal Kingdom" and this year's fact-based "Godfather of Harlem," are more interested in the fortunes of their antiheroes than the wider implications of their professions. All that mattered was whether Tony Soprano or Walter White would escape capture or killing to live another season of television. (I was, to be contrary about it, glad to see those characters go, though I would be happy enough to believe that Carmela and the kids survived that final "Sopranos" blackout, perhaps to star in a reality show.)
I watched a few previous episodes of "Cartel Crew" to better understand what I'd be seeing Monday night, and in most ways, the series is standard-issue reality TV: a cycle of sometimes physical arguments and stage-managed reconciliations resetting the stage for further arguments and so on, interspersed with Serious Conversations between Best Friends and Big Events likely to be spoiled by one or another cast member's unruly behavior.
As elsewhere in reality TV -- and for that matter, much of modern society -- there is an exaggerated concern over whether one is being respected or disrespected, alongside sentimental celebrations of friendship, love and loyalty.
I am quite prepared to believe that any of these people, in a different context, might prove to be more complex and less ridiculous than "Cartel Crew" often makes them seem and to acknowledge that many viewers -- not to say the stars themselves -- will not find them ridiculous at all but inspiring in ways I cannot quite imagine. (Others may find them ridiculous but funny.) None wants to be judged; all are judgmental.
At times, a thoughtful person will emerge from behind the bluster, but from "Laguna Beach" to "Flori-bama Shore" and through the many cities where Real Housewives strut and fret their hour upon the stage, thoughtfulness is not what draws people to these series.
There are plenty of documentaries on self-reformation and trying to live a better life (Lynn Novick's two-part "College Behind Bars" comes your way via PBS on Monday and Tuesday), and they can be dramatic, but it is not Big D drama, the true-life Alexis versus Crystal confrontations that make this sort of reality show catnip to some and anathema to others.
Not surprisingly, Coronel's appearance, teased throughout the show, was held back until the end of the hour, which began with Blanco receiving mysterious phone calls from Coronel's lawyer. She wants to meet. Whether or not Blanco knew this was coming -- his girlfriend, Marie Ramirez De Arellano, looked surprised -- one would wager the plot point had been passed around the "Cartel Crew" production office before any of the people on camera heard or thought of it.
"When a boss calls you for a sit-down, you show up and you sit down," says Blanco.
"I can totally relate to her, being with somebody that has that stigma," Ramirez De Arellano says on the way to the meeting. "If there's people that can show her that there is a way, it's us."
The sit-down is on the deck of a fancy white boat, where the three drink what looks like Champagne and converse in (subtitled) Spanish. The guests seem a little star struck. The hostess, friendly and composed, gives off an air of money, tastefully employed.
"It's an honor to be here next to you," says Blanco, and Coronel returns the compliment.
They discuss their woes in general terms. Coronel says she tries to stay positive. Blanco observes that "life is full of pain" and that you have to learn to balance things sometimes. Coronel avers that it "has made us stronger people. We know how to identify people better," that is, who one's friends are. All agree they don't have many. "It's sad that they judge us without knowing us," Coronel says.
"Sometimes you just want to do what you see other people do. We want to be normal."
"We are normal," says Blanco.
"Yes, we are human," says Ramirez De Arellano.
The purported reason for the meeting -- the actual reason, of course, is to film a scene for "Cartel Crew" -- is that Coronel wants to start a clothing line "in Joaquin's name"; she's heard that Blanco has one of his own "that is about your mother" and wonders about his process. (His "clothing line," Blanco Puro, which does feature images of Griselda Blanco, is your usual assortment of mail-order branded T-shirts and hoodies, along with mugs and phone cases; it is not a likely model for whatever it is Coronel, whose high style was a subject for comment during the El Chapo trial, has in mind.)
He tells her that people will give her a hard time and not pay their bills.
Finally, Ramirez De Arellano asks for advice on travel to Mexico. The women of "Cartel Crew" are going to a protest against refugee detention and child separation in San Diego and might cross the border into Tijuana, and she's "a little afraid." That cartel violence has something to do with this situation, and that everything Coronel has is bought with others' blood and misery, is an irony that eludes them all. Perhaps that will change when "Cartel Crew" visits the border next week. Or perhaps not. Not judging!
Judging a little.

Texto completo: The deal to create the largest newspaper company in the nation -- which became official at 4:10 p.m. on Tuesday -- came about with remarkable speed for a merger that will reshape the media landscape.
In August, Gannett, the parent company of USA Today and more than 100 other dailies, and New Media Investment Group, the owner of the newspaper chain GateHouse Media, announced their intention to join forces. Over the next two months, the plan breezed through the regulatory process, winning approvals from the Justice Department and the European Union. Last week, shareholders at the two companies voted yea. And now one in five daily papers in the United States has the same owner, under the Gannett name, according to figures provided by researchers at the University of North Carolina.
The combined company will have its headquarters in Gannett's home base, McLean, Va., and will be led by Michael E. Reed, the New Media chief executive since 2006. The job puts him in charge of more than 260 dailies -- from small papers like The Tuscaloosa News in Alabama to big ones like The Detroit Free Press.
GateHouse's acquisition of Gannett, a cash-and-stock transaction valued at roughly $ 1.2 billion, was intended to give the combined companies an annual savings of some $ 300 million. Mr. Reed said the bulk of the savings "is not going to come from editorial," meaning newsrooms would be largely spared.
Pressed to say more, Mr. Reed added: "I can't give you an exact number, but almost nothing. I mean, just for context, there's 24,000 employees in the two companies, and a significant portion of the cost reductions are going to come from things other than people. But, obviously, people's a part of this as well. Out of 24,000 people in the company, there's about 2,500 that are actually writing stories every day. So it's a small number, relative to 24,000. So there's so much opportunity beyond the newsroom for us to go get these efficiencies."
Paul Bascobert, the chief executive of the former Gannett who will hold that same title for the new Gannett's operating company, seconded that statement, saying the company's mission "is to connect, protect and celebrate local communities."
"And the core of that is great local journalism," he added. "That's the engine that has gotten us to the place we are today, and that's the engine that's going to carry us forward."
Newspaper executives have sung this tune before, only to end up making aggressive cuts in an industry that has struggled since the one-two punch of the recession more than 10 years ago and the rise of digital media. Twenty-five percent of newsroom employees were laid off between 2008 and 2018, according to the Pew Research Center.
GateHouse and Gannett have both cut newsroom employees in recent years. GateHouse consolidated some business functions at a center in Austin, Texas, resulting in layoffs elsewhere, and laid off more than 100 newsroom employees in the spring. Gannett has let go dozens of journalists, including prominent sportswriters and a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist.
Mr. Reed and Mr. Bascobert, who spoke with The New York Times at the USA Today office in Midtown Manhattan, said the savings they had in mind amounted to 8 percent of annual costs. "So it's not an overwhelming number -- very achievable," Mr. Reed said.
The News Guild, which represents journalists at many of the company's newspapers, has been critical of the merger. The union "intends to hold managers of the new Gannett to the promises they have made," the News Guild president, Bernie Lunzer, said in a statement. "We will continue to demand that they fund high-quality journalism."
Mr. Reed said he would make newsroom decisions with the help of data that tracked reader interest and the output of journalists. "The ability to measure production at the reporter level allows us to get stronger and healthier and do more quality local journalism with the same amount of resources, potentially," he said.
He seemed aware that his stats-based approach to newsroom management was not likely to sit well with the union. "The Guild would fight me on that, and say, 'We should do business like it's 1950,"' Mr. Reed said, adding, "I frankly think the Guild's a big problem, and until we can get them to sit at a table and have a real discussion about where the world is today, there's going to be inefficiencies."
Douglas Arthur, an analyst at Huber Research Partners, questioned Gannett's approach, noting that New Media Investment Group and Gannett had missed revenue projections in the most recent quarter. "The only way they can support it," Mr. Arthur said, speaking of the newspaper industry in general, "is to cut costs. And it feeds on itself: Subscribers go down, advertisers pay less."
The merger raises another question: What does it mean that the beleaguered newspaper industry, considered essential to democracy, is controlled by ever fewer corporations, many of them with a focus on finance rather than covering the news?
The supersize version of Gannett has a byzantine corporate structure. It will be managed, under an agreement that lasts two more years, by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm in Manhattan. Fortress was the entity that controlled New Media Investment Group, the parent of GateHouse Media.
Fortress, in turn, is owned by SoftBank, the Tokyo conglomerate founded by Masayoshi Son, a brash executive who had a friendly meeting with Donald J. Trump in December 2016, when Mr. Trump was the president-elect. (Mr. Son was also a driving force behind the all-but-final megamerger of Sprint, a SoftBank-controlled company, and T-Mobile; that deal won regulatory approval after a lobbying campaign that included company executives staying at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.)
Iris Chyi, a professor at the University of Texas School of Journalism, expressed concern that the newspaper business was in fewer corporate hands. "From a media economics perspective, more competition is always better," Ms. Chyi said. "We don't want a company to have way too much power."
Another large newspaper chain, MediaNews Group, is owned by a hedge fund, Alden Global Capital. Gannett resisted MediaNews Group's bid to buy it earlier this year. On Tuesday, Tribune Company, a publicly owned major chain, announced that Alden had purchased a 25 percent stake in it. McClatchy, another major chain, said last week that it risked insolvency.
Mr. Reed grew up in Elmira, N.Y., and was once a delivery boy for The Star-Gazette there -- the descendant of The Elmira Gazette bought by Frank E. Gannett in 1906. It was the first publication in what would become a newspaper empire.
Now a part-time resident of the Rochester, N.Y., area, Mr. Reed noted that the new incarnation of Gannett would have two publications in that part of the world: The Daily Messenger, in Canandaigua, formerly a GateHouse publication, and The Democrat and Chronicle, a longtime Gannett daily in Rochester.
"I think both products get stronger," he said, "because now we're going to be able to share those resources."
When he spoke of how Gannett would manage the neighboring papers, he mentioned the newsroom. "Do we need two people covering the Rochester Red Wings?" he asked, referring to the minor-league baseball franchise. "So that's where we potentially redeploy assets."

Re "'Democracy Doesn't Come in a Box"' (Video Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Nov. 11):
It's true that democracy does not come in a box, but it also does not happen overnight.
There is no doubt that the United States and coalition military and civilian efforts in Afghanistan have been difficult and at times ineffective or even counterproductive. But it is equally true that over the duration of the war these efforts have also produced positive results and led to significant improvements in the Afghan people's quality of life.
A hasty and poorly planned exit from Afghanistan will have negative effects on both the United States' national security and the Afghan people's welfare. It would be very unfortunate if this administration repeated the mistakes of the last administration when it hastily left Iraq.
There is no need to abandon those Afghans who have courageously fought alongside us and to give ISIS the gift of a new safe haven.
The United States must maintain an adequate level of support to Afghanistan and not throw away the gains and sacrifices of the last 18 years.

Texto completo: Is it too late for Warrenon Medicare-for-all? When Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) initially embraced Medicare-for-all, she was throwing her support behind an idea that was not originally her own. And what fits Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) precisely is not going to do the same for Warren. There is always going to be a sleeve dangling or a hem that's too long. No surprise, when Warren finally debuted her plan to pay for Medicare- for-all " after months of questions of how she would pay for it " she satisfied almost no one. The plan was, depending on the viewpoint of the critic, too radical or not radical enough.
On Friday, Warren tried again, releasing a second plan, a transition designed to quickly beef up health-care coverage by getting many people enrolled in what is essentially a public option, while still putting the United States on the path to the Medicare-for-all promised land in a reasonable time frame. At the same time, she included what Margot Sanger-Katz of the New York Times described as 'a long and detailed list of the things she would do if she couldn't get Congress on board,' including expanding Medicare to include " finally! " dental needs and taking aggressive executive action on drug prices.
From the very first line " 'I spent my career studying why families went broke' " this initiative sounds like it was developed by and made for the Warren who talked to families in bankruptcy and financial distress, and listened to them explain they did everything right and still found themselves caught in a cascade of unpayable bills. This is a plan that " finally " lets Warren seize control of her Medicare-for-all story. But will it be enough?
No small amount of attention in the Democratic primary has gone to health-care issues. There's a reason for that. Many Americans face enormous strain when it comes to paying their medical bills. The most common type of debt reported to a credit reporting agency is a medical bill. More than 10 percent of Americans claimed in a recent Gallup poll to have known someone who died because they couldn't afford medical treatment.
Medicare-for-all purists see these facts and make the reasonable conclusion that we need single-payer now. But if you are a student of human nature, you see another reasonable fear for many: that things can get even worse. Warren's new proposal acknowledges this reality. Warren's not going to immediately force people off their health insurance. Instead, she will let people get their feet wet before they decide to plunge into Medicare-for-all.
To be sure, there's no doubt Warren has made missteps on this subject. First impressions count. But the good news for Warren is that many voters, distracted by impeachment or any number of other stories in this ever-crowded news cycle, are not yet focused on the day in and day out of the Democratic primary. Warren's got room and time to recover. Her initiatives will give people the chance to see how Medicare-for-all would work, easing the fear of change while still promoting it. It just might be what the doctor ordered.

Texto completo: BEIJING - The Chinese government Monday portrayed the country's crackdown in the western region of Xinjiang as a great success against terrorism, trying to counter renewed international criticism following a New York Times article detailing the internal deliberations that led to the mass detention of Muslims in reeducation camps and prisons.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Shuang, criticized the newspaper's report, published Sunday, saying it smeared China's efforts against extremism. But he did not dispute the authenticity of 403 pages of leaked internal documents that confirmed the coercive nature of the measures used against Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims in western China over the past three years.
The documents, provided by a member of the political establishment in China who is concerned about the policy, showed the direct involvement of senior officials in conceiving and ordering it. The papers included internal speeches by China's leader, Xi Jinping, that laid the philosophical groundwork for the clampdown.
"It is precisely because of a series of preventive counterterrorism and de-extremism measures taken in a timely manner that Xinjiang, which had been deeply plagued by terrorism, has not had a violent terrorist incident for Three years," Geng said in resoonse to questions at a regularly scheduled briefing
Xinjiang has experienced violent attacks, tut their extent remains unclear, in part because authorities censored reports on them at the time and continue to restrict independent reporting.
A group of 12 U.N human rights experts has presented the Chinese government with a scathing critique of its counterterrorism laws and deradicalization regulations, warning that they flout binding obligations under international law and risk stoking the extremism they are said to be intended to prevent.
In a 21-page etter addressed to Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the experts said that laws and regulations that provide the legal framework for China's mass incarceration of Uighurs and other Muslims are "neither necessary nor proportionate."
Australia's foreign minister, Marise Payne, called the disclosures disturbing, as did several U.S. politicians, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg, two leading candidates in the Democratic presidential race.

'Is that this week?': White House awaits Anonymous book with a yawn

Texto completo: The White House is shrugging off publication of a book by an anonymous author claiming to be a senior administration official, reacting with a mix of weary indifference and lukewarm contempt.
The book, A Warning, goes on sale Tuesday after two weeks of lackluster reviews.
Although other books have prompted the White House to prepare for battle, this one arrives with officials focused on impeachment hearings and keen to present an air of normality.
Stephanie Grisham, the president’s press secretary, said: “Others can fret about ridiculous, cowardly accusations; President Trump remains focused on delivering results to the American people.”
She added that the White House now had a clearer idea of the identity of the author.
“Yes — a coward,” she said when asked.
The anonymous author first surfaced with an op-ed piece published last year by the New York Times. The writer suggested a cabal of officials had launched a resistance effort inside the White House to thwart “Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office.”
But with publication of the book looming, officials said the approach of remaining anonymous undermined any effort at authority. And the absence of explosive new details — aside from well-known accounts of the president’s bad temper and short attention span — makes it easier to dismiss.
In contrast, Cliff Sims’s insider tale of working for Trump, Team of Vipers, created an air of excitement and dread inside the White House at the start of the year, according to a former staffer.
“Everyone was dying to have a look at it and see if their names were in it. This one doesn’t feel the same,” he said.
Ask aides this week about the anonymous book, and the response is largely indifference.
“Is that this week?” one said.
Such responses might be dismissed as an act of affected nonchalance were it not for a string of scathing reviews in publications that might usually be expected to talk up any warts-and-all biographies of the Trump administration.
A withering New York Times review highlighted how the unnamed author has flipped and flopped on how best to resist Trump’s wilder impulses and ridicules an insider whose insight appears little greater than an outsider’s.
“A Warning, Anonymous says, is intended for a ‘broad audience,’ though to judge by the parade of bland, methodical arguments (Anonymous loves to qualify criticisms with a lawyerly ‘in fairness’), the ideal reader would seem to be an undecided voter who has lived in a cave for the past three years, and is irresistibly moved by quotations from Teddy Roosevelt and solemn invocations of Cicero,” the Times wrote.
The Washington Post concludes the book adds little to the debate other than to repeat descriptions of a president uninterested in detail and who regards criticism as treason.
“However accurate and sobering such characterizations may be, they all belong in a folder labeled Stuff We Already Know. Unfortunately, much of A Warning reads like a longer version of the op-ed, purposely vague and avoiding big revelations in order to preserve the author’s anonymity.”

Texto completo: It has happened before, in both political parties. At the beginning of a presidential primary season, with a big field of candidates starting the race, the party faithful say, Isn’t this great? We have so many good candidates — almost an embarrassment of riches! Then, after several months of campaigning, they say, Can’t somebody enter this race and save us?
That is where some Democrats find themselves right now. The party’s top three candidates in national polls are Joe Biden, who is too old to be president; Elizabeth Warren, who is too radical; and Bernie Sanders, who is too old and too radical.
The distant fourth-place runner, although a big favorite in Iowa, is Pete Buttigieg, who at 37 is, some voters believe, too young and inexperienced for the Oval Office. The other candidates are also-rans.
Now, two men who earlier considered and rejected a presidential run are back in the mix. Last December, former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick announced he would not run, saying he did not want to subject those he loved to “the cruelty of our elections process.” Last March, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he, too, would not run, opting instead to focus on a new climate change initiative called Beyond Carbon.
Now, it appears Patrick has gotten over the cruelty problem, and Bloomberg has moved beyond Beyond Carbon.
Patrick announced his candidacy in a brief and platitudinous video Thursday morning. “I admire and respect the candidates in the Democratic field; they bring a richness of ideas and experience and a depth of character that makes me proud to be a Democrat,” Patrick said. “But if the character of the candidates is an issue in every election, this time is about the character of the country. This time is about whether the day after the election, America will keep her promises.”
It is not clear precisely what that means, but the short version is that Patrick does not believe the other candidates can win.
“Mr. Patrick hopes to bridge the divisions that have shaped the contest so far, appealing to centrists and liberals, white and nonwhite voters and across generational and economic lines in a way none of the candidates have been able to do,” the New York Times reported. “A close friend of former President Barack Obama, he has told advisers that he envisions a campaign similar to Mr. Obama’s 2008 bid, focusing more on bringing people together and healing the country than making a particular ideological case.”
Really? It seems fair to note that capturing the Obama magic is easier said than done, and that the United States in 2020 will be in a different place than in 2008. Even Patrick says his bid is “a Hail Mary from two stadiums over.”
For his part, Bloomberg has not yet pulled the trigger — he is a serial tease in presidential politics — but he has something that Patrick and other Democratic rivals don’t have: $52 billion. With his money, Bloomberg could self-finance a run from start to finish without ever having to ask a single donor for a penny. While Patrick worries how to raise funds, Bloomberg has the freedom to do what he wants.
Both men, are said to worry about the lack of a centrist alternative in the field. “Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to [defeat Trump],” a Bloomberg spokesman told the Times. It’s a legitimate concern, given Democrats’ leftward movement toward Medicare for All, virtually open borders, free college, and wealth taxes.
On the other hand, there is a centrist candidate — at least in Democratic terms — in the field: Biden. What Bloomberg and Patrick both sense is that Biden can’t make it in the long run. Such concerns are usually references to Biden’s age, but Bloomberg, who will be nearly 79 years old on Inauguration Day 2021, is actually older than Biden. If voters want yet another candidate who, if elected, will turn 80 early in his term, Bloomberg could be the ticket. (Patrick, who will be 64 on Inauguration Day, is a relatively youthful alternative to the current Democratic frontrunners.)
Democratic worries are understandable. But late, Hail Mary entrances don’t work. This race has been going on for months. There have been several debates. Voters have been listening. Iowa is fast approaching. The field is what it is. One of the candidates in the race right now will win the nomination, go on to face President Trump, and have a chance to become the next president. There’s no savior waiting to rescue Democrats — and that includes Deval Patrick and Michael Bloomberg.

Texto completo: Troubling disclosure
Editor: I am certain that I am not the only Scrantonian who is troubled by the investigation into newly elected Scranton School Board member Tara Yanni.
As reported in The Times-Tribune, Yanni allegedly contacted school board members and district personnel regarding the status of her husband’s application for a district coaching position. In an initial newspaper article, Yanni’s attorney, Richard Fanucci, labeled the accusations as “completely untrue.” In a follow-up report that provided more evidence of the alleged contacts, he shifted his stance, stating that “she asked questions … there is no harm in doing that.”
No harm? Fanucci can’t be serious. In a school district plagued by scandals there is significant harm if a newly elected school board member’s actions are deemed unethical in accordance with district policy. I do not know Yanni but I am puzzled as to why she would be asking questions, not the job applicant. I find it hard to justify such actions on any terms. I am dismayed that she would not comprehend the appearance of impropriety in her outreach, however innocent her lawyer would like us to believe it was.
I also am concerned that the school district is conducting this investigation given its dismal track record of truth finding. I urge The Times-Tribune’s fine investigative reporters to stay on top of this matter until its justifiable conclusion.

Real ID disaster
Editor: My buddy tried twice to get a “real ID” and still doesn’t have one.
The first time he was told that his birth certificate wasn’t sufficient because it lacked an embossed seal. So he went down to the State Office Building, paid $35 for copies of a correct certificate and went back for a second try. His birth certificate was denied because it lacked his middle initial that is on his Social Security card.
“Do you want me to pay another 35 bucks?” he asked. The clerk replied, “No, just get a new Social Security card.”
Who knows what may happen if he does that? Would he have to apply for Social Security benefits again? Will his checks stop? What a mess. God help us if a so-called “real ID” becomes a requirement to vote.

Agenda revealed
Editor: President Trump, the Republican Party and the national conservative news media all have a lot of nerve to constantly accuse Democrats of secret conspiracies against President Trump when a real secret conspiracy has been going on for a while that is associated with the Koch brothers and others on the radical right.
This conspiracy includes very wealthy individuals, a big part of the national Republican Party, much of the national conservative news media, many conservative think tanks and other very conservative political groups. Their goal and dream is to abolish all federal government social programs that help citizens of the lower and middle classes. They would love to abolish Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, college student loans and unemployment insurance benefits.
However, the one social program that they hate the most and most want to abolish is Social Security. What they basically want to do is establish a “survival-of-the-fittest” social Darwinism in our country. A book that does an excellent job of detailing the parts of this secret right-wing conspiracy is Jane Mayer’s “Dark Money: the Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind The Rise of the Radical Right.”
It was selected by The New York Times among the 10 best books of 2018. To my knowledge, no one ever has successfully refuted anything asserted in this book. In addition, Mayer has been a winner of or a finalist in at least 12 awards and prizes in journalism.
Every American should read this book.
In my opinion, most everyday Americans who are Republicans do not favor abolishing all of our federal government social programs that help citizens, as the people engaged in the conspiracy want to.

Momentum shifts
Editor: Jerry Fagniani, local sage and adviser to writers, has said that when this period of American history ends, the heroes will have been the writers - the journalists who have employed the real facts to tell an honest story.
The Time magazine cover story of Nov. 11 is jolting. It portrays Rudy Giuliani as more selfish, self-centered and self-serving than even the president himself. That is not to say, however, more momentous. We have not known what has motivated Giuliani up to now.
How might this scenario apply locally? Well, the first large meeting on the Keystone Sanitary Landfill that I attended was at the Dunmore Community Center on May 12, 2014. Landfill engineer Al Magnotta presented a hopeful picture - so that three months later in August, a plan for a 44.6-year expansion was announced.
A book was published in the summer of 2018 to say that Scrantonians have “a double whammy,” i.e., a local businessman and a commander in chief, and both rule by self-interest. Landfill owner Louis DeNaples’ prestige may have taken a hit since September when his agent suggested a kind of blackmail in order to get expansion approval during a public meeting in Dunmore.
Magnotta heard the response of residents dead set against the threats he leveled. He and his employer also heard the leaders of a resistance - at least eight women and two men - who took him on. Convincingly mentioned were the many who already had moved out of Dunmore and many others who had been affected by cancer. Some of these, most perhaps, had been in attendance 56 months before at the 2014 meeting.
A write-in candidate in Dunmore has been confirmed as elected. It makes for quite a different borough council.

Trump right on not banning flavored e-cigarettes

Texto completo: The prohibitionist impulse can be overcome, with great difficulty and over a long period, but it can never be quite defused. Right now, America is moving toward legalizing recreational cannabis, after a decadeslong law enforcement campaign against it. But we also are hearing demands for a ban on flavored e-cigarettes -- which President Donald Trump reportedly has decided to oppose.
That would be a reversal from his earlier statements, and his motives do not appear to be pure. "Allies working for the vaping industry have told Mr. Trump of battleground state polling of his own voters that showed the issue costing him support," reported The New York Times. But I'm content anytime the president does the right thing, even if he does it for the wrong reason.
The right reason not to outlaw flavored vapes is that it would deny competent adults the right to decide for themselves. The argument against these vapes is that they are meant to appeal to teens. But some grown-ups, believe it or not, have used candy flavors to help them quit smoking. Lots of adults like doughnuts and apple pie; why wouldn't smokers like e-cigarettes that let them enjoy those flavors without the calories?
Yes, allowing such products means some juveniles will get unauthorized access to something that isn't good for them. But the same is true of marijuana. We learned that the chief result of forbidding it was to create a black market that caters to kids as well as adults. Black markets inevitably attract criminal organizations, and they deprive users of the protections against adulteration that legal markets foster.
The recent spate of lung illnesses related to vaping, it appears, is attributable mostly, if not entirely, to the use of an additive, vitamin E acetate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In a legal market, suppliers would most likely stop using it, and the government could require them to do so. But in an illegal market, such as a flavored vape ban would produce, there is no protection for users.
Allowing flavored vapes is a far wiser policy -- even if Trump supports it.

Texto completo: The finale of Elizabeth Olsen's show about grief hits Facebook Watch, and a harrowing documentary on the conflict in Syria premieres on PBS.
What's Streaming
SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS Stream on Facebook Watch. In the first episode of this half-hour drama, Leigh (Elizabeth Olsen), a young woman coping with the recent death of her husband, bonds with his brother, Danny (Jovan Adepo), over the common things people say to offer their condolences (like the show's title) that can feel like empty lip service. That exchange illuminates the show's driving theme -- that there's no right or wrong way to grieve. The series feels like a cross between "Dead to Me" and "This Is Us," and sees Leigh and her family struggle through the healing process. In the Season 2 finale, Leigh confronts an upsetting revelation about her husband, Matt (Mamoudou Athie), and her sister Jules (Kelly Marie Tran) plans to take a summer trip abroad.
ILIZA SHLESINGER: UNVEILED Stream on Netflix. Tapping her own life for inspiration, this recently married comedian dishes out the harsh truths about wedding planning, bachelorette parties and honeymooning in her fifth standup special for Netflix. "Getting married is not that much fun," Schlesinger says. "You're not allowed to say that especially as a woman, god forbid over 30."
ANGELFISH (2019) Rent on Amazon, iTunes and Vudu. In her music career, Princess Nokia, the rapper born Destiny Frasqueri, honored her birth year and the early '90s New York rap scene with her 2017 mixtape "1992 Deluxe." Now, in her feature film debut, the rapper will revisit that era as Eva, a young college-bound New Yorker who falls in love with a high school dropout (Jimi Stanton) in the Bronx during the summer of 1993.
What's on TV
FRONTLINE 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Like "The Cave," which chronicles life in a subterranean hospital near Damascus, "For Sama" centers on a Syrian hospital in Aleppo, at a time when citizens were living under siege. In it, the filmmaker Waad al-Kateab captured what life was like in 2016, when the hospital her husband ran was the only one left standing following Russian and Syrian airstrikes. In her New York Times review, Teo Bugbee wrote that although al-Kateab "focuses on the graphic, brutal, stomach-churning effects of al-Assad's assault," she also chronicles personal milestones like getting married and giving birth to her daughter, Sama, as the rebel-held city crumbles around her. Bugbee designated the film a Critic's Pick, writing that the "reflexive filmmaking provides an uncannily relatable example of the mundane experience of war," where "profound bravery exists alongside profound ordinariness."
ERNIE & JOE: CRISIS COPS 9 p.m. on HBO. This documentary by Jenifer McShane focuses on two San Antonio police officers trying to change the law enforcement system from within. The pair, Ernie Stevens and Joe Smarro, work on the police department's mental health unit, which aims to curb potentially violent encounters with people who have mental illnesses and help them receive treatment, rather than jail time. The film offers a glimpse at a more humane method of policing, one in which Stevens and Smarro communicate to the people they encounter "as equals, rather than barking orders as authority figures," Kristen Yoonsoo Kim wrote in her New York Times review.

Texto completo: Pete Buttigieg's presidential campaign, struggling to build support among black voters, removed a photo from its website of a Kenyan woman that was used earlier this year to illustrate his plan to dismantle racism in the United States.
The photo of the woman kneeling and talking to a child, selected from an assortment of stock photos available for public reuse, was first posted over the summer as part of the rollout of Buttigieg's “Douglass Plan," billed as “a comprehensive investment in the empowerment of black America."
The plan includes health care, education, and voting-rights reforms as well as proposals to address discrimination in policing.
Buttigieg has failed to gain traction among black voters — a critical constituency in the path to the Democratic nomination — even as polls show he is building support in largely white Iowa.
A statement released by Buttigieg's campaign apologized for “confusion" and said the photo — which was posted on the website by a contractor working for the campaign — was removed from the Douglass plan Web page in mid-September in a “regular update" to the site. Once the campaign learned the photo was taken in Kenya, it was removed in recent days from other places on the site as well.
The error was first reported by The Intercept after the woman in the photo, shot in Kenya, expressed confusion as to why she had appeared on a website for a US presidential campaign.

Democrats' Southern wins could affect redistricting
The reelection victory by Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards over the weekend has assured Democrats of an all-important place at the table when political maps are redrawn after the 2020 Census for future elections to Congress and the state Legislature.
Edwards's narrow triumph on Saturday marked the third significant win in a Southern state in two weeks for Democrats, following their takeover of both legislative houses in Virginia and the defeat in Kentucky of Republican Governor Matt Bevin by Democratic Attorney General Andy Beshear.
The recent Southern state elections provided a preview of the battle over redistricting power that is to come next year in many states. Although about one-quarter of the states use independent commissions or nonpartisan staff in their redistricting procedures, state lawmakers, governors, and other elected officials have key roles in redistricting in most other states.
If one party controls all pivotal state offices, that party can draw districts to the advantage of its candidates — a practice known as gerrymandering that can help lock in a party's political power for the next decade.
Republicans who already controlled the Louisiana House and Senate had hoped to consolidate power by defeating Edwards, or else obtain a two-thirds majority in both legislative chambers that would allow them to override his vetoes. Neither occurred.
In Kentucky, Beshear's election also will give the veto pen to a Democrat when the state Legislature draws new districts. The Kentucky House and Senate are controlled by Republicans.
Following the 2010 Census, Republicans who had swept to power in many state houses used their newfound majorities to draw districts that increased their odds of winning future elections. Democrats had done the same thing historically when they had power.
But a backlash has grown against such gerrymandering over the past decade. In 2018, voters in Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, and Utah approved ballot measures designed to diminish legislative partisanship in redistricting.

Concerns remain about Trump's visit to doctor
WASHINGTON — President Trump's impromptu weekend visit to a doctor remained shrouded in secrecy Monday, as he stayed away from the public eye and the White House dodged questions about his health.
Trump, 73, made an unscheduled trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda on Saturday, later saying on Twitter he had begun "phase one" of his annual physical exam and the results had been "very good."
It is unusual for a president to do a physical exam in multiple stages months apart, and the circumstances surrounding Trump's visit renewed questions about the status of his health and the White House's handling of his medical information, say several experts.
The White House would not say Monday if Trump planned to release records from his visit or describe which tests he took.
In a statement on Saturday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump had undergone a "quick exam and labs" and that he "remains healthy and energetic without complaints." Grisham also said Trump had taken advantage of a "free weekend" in Washington to "begin portions of his routine annual physical exam."
The White House did not respond to requests for more information Monday. Two people who interacted with Trump late last week said he seemed to be hoarse and have signs of a cold, but nothing serious seemed amiss.

McConnell: Lack of civility is country's biggest problem
Bemoaning the country's lack of civility, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday that both sides of the political spectrum need to defuse the anger surrounding political discourse.
Speaking in his home state of Kentucky, he said the country needs to “learn how to behave better, how to be able to disagree without anger."
McConnell is a key ally of President Trump and has referred to himself as the “Grim Reaper" for his strategy of burying the legislative priorities of House Democrats in the GOP-led Senate.
On Monday, the senator listed incivility as the country's biggest problem.
“We have a behavioral problem," McConnell said in a speech after receiving an award from the Kentucky Electric Cooperatives at the group's annual meeting. “People are acting out and it's not, I don't think, limited to one ideological place or another. You've just got a lot of people engaging in bad behavior."
Kentucky Democratic Party spokeswoman Marisa McNee scoffed at McConnell's words, pointing to the senator's reputation as a hard-hitting political tactician.
“If that's what he believes, that this is such a stain on our politics, the lack of civility, does he regret the way he has allowed his own campaign to behave?" she said Monday.
McConnell didn't mention the House impeachment inquiry into Trump's dealings with Ukraine or any other emotionally charged issues for prompting his remarks. The senator later told reporters that his motivation was last year's acrimonious confirmation process for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Asked if Trump, known for his combative tweets, was partly to blame for stoking tensions, McConnell replied: “I think we have a civility problem and I didn't confine it to just liberals. I think it's across the board."
McConnell is seeking a seventh Senate term in 2020.

Texto completo: State Republicans are rallying behind Michael Murphy, student body president at the University of Florida who faces impeachment after details emerged about his connections to President Donald Trump.

Murphy agreed to pay $50,000 in public student funds to Trumps eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Kimberly Guilfoyle, an adviser to the presidents re-election campaign, for speeches the pair gave on campus Oct. 10.

An email surfaced later that showed Murphy planned the event with an official working for the campaign. Amid outrage by some student senators and hundreds who protested the speeches, he was served Tuesday with a resolution for his impeachment.

Two days later, the Republican Party of Florida posted a petition titled Stand with UFs Student Body President on its website. It includes a link to a fundraising page for the GOP.

Its completely outrageous that the UF student president is facing impeachment for bringing Donald Trump Jr. to speak on campus, the petition page reads. If it was Chelsea Clinton, theyd be praising him. Enough is enough!

Multiple messages left with the partys main office in Tallahassee were not returned. It is unclear who started the petition, as well as who has signed it and how much money has been raised.

Sen. Rick Scott, Floridas former governor, also tweeted a defense of Murphy. Like the petition page, Scott contended that calls for the students impeachment are the result of a pervasive trend that shuts conservative voices out of college campuses.

Multiple media outlets, including the New York Times, reported that Murphy is being represented by Tallahassee attorney Daniel E. Nordby, who served as general counsel to Scott as governor. Nordby did not immediately return a call for comment.

Echoing Scott and the Florida GOP, Nordby gave reporters a statement that said the situation at UF is reflective of students on college campuses across America that are intolerant of conservative views.

Donald Trump Jr. tweeted about the issue, also linking the possible impeachment to an effort to limit conservative ideas at universities.

The university weighed in, too, releasing a statement Friday that cleared Murphy of any wrongdoing. It said the agreement between student government and the speakers was reviewed before and after the event and determined to be compliant with all applicable laws, policies and processes.

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Nov. 15, 2019 edition of the Inside the Dodgers newsletter. To receive the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
I broke the story of Andrew Toles’ promotion to the big leagues in the summer of 2016. One thing I didn’t include in any of my reporting at the time was this text message from a Dodgers staffer: “that could end poorly.”
The story of Toles’ career with the Dodgers hasn’t technically ended. He’s still under contract to the team, but he spent all of 2019 on the restricted list and did not play. The reason for his absence was never revealed; we only knew that Toles had the support of the organization while he was away. For a player who joined the team in a cloud of mystery, it was an appropriate fadeout to the decade.
The Dodgers were well aware of his question marks when they signed Toles as a minor league free agent. They knew Toles had been disciplined by two different college programs — kicked off the University of Tennessee baseball team in 2011 and suspended by Chipola College in 2012. They knew the Tampa Bay Rays expelled Toles from his Single-A team following a blow-up with his manager in May 2014. They knew all this because the GM who drafted and developed Toles with the Rays was none other than the Dodgers’ Andrew Friedman.
Toles’ second chance in professional baseball went much better than his first. Fast-tracked from Single-A to the majors in 2016, Toles slashed .314/.365/.505 in 48 regular season games. By October, he had ramrodded his way into the starting outfield. Toles started four of six NLCS games against the Cubs that year, going 6 for 13 (.462) with a pair of doubles. At 24 years old, Toles had made the leap from prospect, to failed prospect, to starting outfielder on a playoff team. The transformation landed him in the pages of the New York Times.
The following winter, the Dodgers jettisoned their de facto left fielder, Howie Kendrick, paving the way for Toles to seize regular playing time in 2017. However, a knee injury in May promptly ended his season. His absence on the field would have been more conspicuous without the emergence of Chris Taylor. Still, by 2018, Toles was healthy and competing for a job in spring training. There was a pathway for him to regain his standing on the depth chart.
By the final week of camp, Toles and Joc Pederson were in the running for the final outfield job. Pederson went 8 for 54 during the Cactus League season. Toles went 15 for 53. Pederson won the job anyway, and Toles began the season in Triple-A. There, a hamstring injury cost him two months. He batted .306 at Oklahoma City but never cracked a Dodger outfield rotation that now featured a rejuvenated Pederson and Matt Kemp, in addition to Chris Taylor, Kiké Hernandez and Yasiel Puig. On Sept. 29 in San Francisco, Toles singled and stole second base against the Giants. He hasn’t batted in a major league game since.
Judging only what he did on the field, Toles deserves some extolling. His postseason at-bats, limited though they were, look impressive in the context of the decade. His .792 regular-season OPS compares surprisingly well with the Dodgers’ other outfielders of the last 10 years. His effort in the outfield and on the bases was at least as impressive as hit bat. Ironically, Toles’ hard-nosed efforts landed him in the operating room and derailed his early promise perhaps as much as anything. Toles is still only 27 years old. But without knowing the substance of his off-the-field issue(s), it’s hard to say anything definitive about his future in baseball.
All we have for now are memories of one of the game’s best personalities, a talented athlete who offered tantalizing glimpses on the field. Who else points at a mean-mugging Chase Utley and says, unironically, “I wake up in the morning and I’m like, ‘how can I be like Chase Utley today?’ ” Who else admits he checked FanGraphs to see when he’d get called up from Triple-A? Who else, while being unable to walk, says (also unironically), “I’m pretty much healthy right now … besides my knee”? No one, that’s who. You can tell the story off the 2010s Dodger teams without Andrew Toles, but it wouldn’t be nearly as fun.

Texto completo: During the last Democratic debate, in Ohio, there was a moment that stood out. Elizabeth Warren and I got into a debate over the impact of automation versus trade on the elimination of manufacturing jobs. Joe Biden also chimed in, agreeing that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs, so it’s important to deal with the root causes.
Immediately, fact checkers were quick to point to a study showing that 88 percent of factory job losses from 2000 to 2010 were caused by automation. Yet, in the days following that debate, some prominent media figures asserted that the threat of automation is not real. The Times columnist Paul Krugman even called it “a sort of escapist fantasy for centrists who don’t want to confront truly hard questions.”
It’s easy to cite incomplete statistics that ignore the full picture and the situation on the ground, but I’ve done the math while spending time in struggling communities. Venture for America, the nonprofit I founded, sent me across this country, to Detroit, St. Louis, Birmingham, Ala., and other communities, where we attempted to spur entrepreneurship and create jobs. It was during this time when I spoke with workers who had lost their jobs to automation and couldn’t find more work. My organization was helping to create jobs, but automation was displacing tens of thousands of workers in these states. We were pouring water into a bathtub with a giant hole ripped in the bottom.
On the campaign trail, I’ve spoken with workers in Michigan, Ohio and western Pennsylvania, workers who are worried about the inevitability of their jobs falling victim to automation.
Automation doesn’t just affect millions of factory workers and truck drivers. Bookkeepers, journalists, retail and food service workers, office clerks, call center employees and even teachers also face the threat of being replaced by machines. These are some of the most common jobs in America. According to the Council of Economic Advisers in 2016, 83 percent of jobs paying less than $20 per hour could have substantial parts of their work given over to automation. And advanced degrees won’t protect you from this threat — doctors, accountants, and even lawyers face the same risk.
Around five million manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2000, with automation being a main factor. Many of those jobs were in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Iowa — states that swung to Donald Trump in 2016. In 2000, manufacturing employment started to plummet, the same year disability applications began surging. Around the same time, about half of the Michigan workers who left the labor force may have filed for disability and many might never get off it, as the rate at which people come off disability benefits is extremely low. We then saw surges in suicides and drug overdoses to the point where life expectancy has either declined or stayed flat for three years in a row, something that hasn’t happened since the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918.
We have to stop denying the effects of automation on our people and focus on 21st-century solutions to these problems. Looking at gross domestic product, the stock market and unemployment is a very 20th-century way of measuring the economy. Self-driving trucks will be great for the G.D.P.; they’ll be terrible for millions of truck drivers.
Our economic numbers need to measure what matters. We know stock market prices don’t mean much to the 78 percent of workers in this country who are living paycheck to paycheck or the 40 percent of workers who are a $400 bill away from financial crisis.
We need to move to a human-centered capitalism, where the market serves us instead of the other way around. That starts by investing $1,000 per month in every adult so that we can build a trickle-up economy, as I have proposed, with the proper measurements and incentives.
Human-centered capitalism would ensure that people are more important than money and that markets exist to serve our common goals and values.
My vision calls for new top-line measurements that take into account indicators like: health and life expectancy, mental health, substance abuse, childhood success rates, average income, environmental quality, retirement savings, labor force participation and engagement, infrastructure and homelessness.
These are the type of metrics that truly measure the quality of our lives. How many Americans woke up this morning excited about G.D.P.? We would all be more interested in knowing that four in 10 people in the United States live with unhealthy air or that nearly three in five adults with mental illness do not get treated. When we put these measurements at the center of the economy, we’ll be able to make the big changes we need in order to improve our lives.
When I first started running for president, I was the only candidate talking about these big solutions for our economic problems. But the Democratic Party is realizing that automation worries many Americans. This vision and message drove the economic portion of the debate on the Democratic stage last time.
It’s because voters know that the system is rigged against them. Big companies are automating their jobs, sucking value out of our local economies and paying little or nothing in taxes. Our G.D.P. is over $20 trillion, and yet the average American is struggling.
It’s only getting worse. A millennial has only a 50-50 chance of doing better than their parents. For someone born in the 1940s, the likelihood was 90 percent. The American dream is dying by the numbers.
We need to talk about the real causes and solutions of these problems instead of blaming the current occupant of the Oval Office.

Uncovering Biased Algorithms Is Better Than the Alternative

Texto completo: We keep stumbling across examples of discrimination in algorithms, but that's far better than their remaining hidden.
Each week, we review the week's news , offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry.
Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news:
I'm about to suggest something that sounds controversial: Maybe it's good that we keep discovering biased algorithms?
Let's rewind. A pair of articles this past week revealed that software that is used to make decisions on the behalf of humans appears to do so with gender bias.
First, it came to light that the algorithm that calculates credit quotas for Apple's new credit card may give higher limits to men than to women. Goldman Sachs, which issues the card, said its credit decisions were "based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law."
And my colleague Cade Metz reported that artificial intelligence services from Google and Amazon both failed to recognize the word "hers" as a pronoun, but correctly identified "his." Other, similar algorithms "generally don't give women enough credit" when analyzing text, he added.
This isn't surprising. Algorithms are written by humans, who are inherently biased -- and that can seep into the way they frame the analysis that underlies their code. Artificial intelligence software is trained on data that contains all kinds of human biases, which can then appear in its own inferences.
"What algorithms are doing is giving you a look in the mirror," Sandra Wachter, an associate professor in law and A.I. ethics at Oxford University, told me. "They reflect the inequalities of our society."
That we often see inequality is troubling. If software is going to choose a credit limit, it should do so fairly. If A.I. is supposed to parse information for us, we would like it to do so objectively.
The problem is, algorithms are everywhere, making decisions on our behalf in ways that are often opaque to us. "How many times am I not seeing certain jobs ads? How many times do I get advertised higher prices?" Professor Wachter asked. "I often don't know that I'm being treated unfairly."
In that sense, the more often we unearth cases of bias, the better. Because not only is it one algorithm fewer left unchecked, it's more evidence to demonstrate why we must solve the problem.
Not that that's easy, of course. Computer scientists are trying to work out how to spot and remove bias in data; others are developing ways to make algorithms better able to explain their decisions. And there are pushes to force companies to be more transparent and accountable about how they use algorithms. It's a slog, but it is happening.
"It's unrealistic to assume that we'll ever have a neutral system," Professor Wachter said. "But with the right systems in place, we can mitigate some of the biases."
Banking With Big Tech
With that Apple Card article fresh in your mind, now is a good moment to think about Big Tech's push into personal finance.
Google announced that it was teaming up with Citigroup and the Stanford Federal Credit Union to offer a "smart checking" account next year. Exactly what that will entail is unclear, but Google says it will help bank customers "benefit from useful insights and budgeting tools," via its Pay app.
Also, Facebook unveiled a digital payment system, called Pay, that will let users make payments across its Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms. That's alongside its separate initiative to revolutionize the world of global finance with its own cryptocurrency, Libra.
This is all unsurprising. The companies are attracted to the prospect of a new revenue stream. The question is whether or not they can make a go of it.
Regulators and lawmakers are already unimpressed. New York State regulators said they would investigate the potentially discriminatory algorithm used by Apple Card. Libra has come under immense criticism from all sides because people don't trust it. And Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, already said of Google's banking effort to CNBC: "There ought to be very strict scrutiny."
But there's another question here: Do people even want to use Big Tech to bank? There's a lot of inertia in the world of personal finance, and persuading people to switch from their bank to Apple or Google or Facebook will require features with genuine utility, or higher interest rates, or something else stellar. Fear about financial data privacy is probably a concern for consumers, too. In other words, it's a high bar.
Hunger for Health Data
News surfaced that a partnership between Google and the hospital provider Ascension could allow the data of the health care company's patients -- 50 million in total -- to be uploaded to Google's cloud-computing platform. Without patients or doctors being notified, some of that data, including names, dates of birth, lab tests and diagnoses, were already being uploaded.
Ascension said it was exploring "machine-learning applications that will have the potential to support improvements in clinical quality" through the deal. Google said it would provide "tools that Ascension could use to support improvements in clinical quality and patient safety."
This may all be totally O.K. It's perfectly legal for health care providers to share patients' medical information with business partners like electronic medical record companies. Still, the Office for Civil Rights in the Department of Health and Human Services plans to seek more information about whether it complies with the law anyway.
Nonetheless, many people found it unnerving. That's probably because of Google's motivations: According to The Wall Street Journal, Google hasn't charged Ascension for the work because it hopes to develop systems based on what it learns. It would eventually sell those systems to other health care providers.
Again, there's nothing wrong with that. But it comes off as a little tone deaf to slurp up data as intimate as health care records without informing patients, at a time when data privacy concerns are more heightened than ever.

Texto completo: COCHABAMBA, Bolivia - In the days since the ouster of Evo Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, deep ethnic tensions that have long divided the country have erupted, complicating efforts to move Bolivia out of political crisis.
Morales, a champion of the indigenous, has now been replaced by an acting president of European descent, and resentments have surfaced. Police officers have ripped the indigenous insignia off their uniforms. Protesters have burned the indigenous flag. And the acting president, who posted tweets many consider racist, initially appointed a Cabinet without a single indigenous member.
"We feel threatened," said Juan Acume, a farmer from the Quechua, an indigenous group, near a protest barricade of earth mounds and tree trunks across Bolivia's main highway on Wednesday night. "They don't represent us; they reject us, the indigenous."
Morales' nearly 14 years in power represented a breakthrough for the three-quarters of Bolivians who are either of indigenous descent or identify as members of indigenous groups. But he also reinforced his base of support with explicit appeals to racial identity that many Bolivians found threatening and polarizing. Now that Morales has taken asylum in Mexico, his supporters fear the loss of their hard-won political and economic gains.
Their fears grew when Jeanine Añez Chavez, an opposition senator, swiftly proclaimed herself the country's interim president Tuesday, promising to unite the nation and to call new elections in January. But Wednesday, when she unveiled her caretaker Cabinet, not one of the 11 ministers identified as a member of an indigenous group. After an outcry, she appointed an indigenous minister of culture as she added more Cabinet members.
In previous years, Añez had published provocative posts on Twitter mocking indigenous people's culture, branding their religious rites "satanic" and calling Morales a "poor Indian."
She has since deleted the tweets, but not before they spread widely on social media. They were supplemented by a cascade of fake racist posts attributed to Añez and spread by Morales' supporters, according to a media monitoring group, the Bolivia Verifies Observatory.
At a news conference Friday, Añez denounced the fake tweets and said that her enemies were spreading disinformation. But asked if any of the racial tweets attributed to her were real, she did not respond.
"This rhetoric of racism and discrimination," she said, "is not real, and we reject it."
Tensions between the indigenous population and Bolivia's long-ruling elite of European descent date to Spanish colonial times, and have simmered under the surface ever since.
Diego von Vacano, a Bolivian political scientist at Texas A&M University, likened traditional race relations in Bolivia to "the apartheid system in South Africa, with indigenous people being second class citizens."
He said, "The significance of Evo was he rose up and achieved a lot of positive things for indigenous people."
But as Morales began losing his grip on power over the past three years, von Vacano added, "he rallied his indigenous base through the rhetoric of racial distinctions, which has nowpolarized much of the country."
During Morales' time in office, the number of indigenous representatives in ministries and congress grew, and included women who wear traditional full skirts called polleras, which were once disdained in public spaces.
Morales also redistributed the country's natural gas wealth to native communities, and led a renaissance of traditional cuisine, music and dress.
He introduced a multicolored flag, called the Whipala, which represents the country's diverse indigenous groups, and made it an official flag alongside the country's traditional independence-era banner of red, green and yellow.
These policies have made him an idol of many in Bolivia's main indigenous communities, the Quechua and Aymara, which make up about a third of country's adult population, according to the latest census.
They also have fueled resentment among many Bolivians of mixed or European descent, as well as the country's smaller indigenous groups, who accused Morales of ethnic favoritism and exploiting racial differences for political gain.
Morales' critics say that his government's fixation with a particular brand of Bolivia's diverse indigenous culture - the highland subsistence farming communities - masks the country's growing cosmopolitanism. The percentage of Bolivians who have identified themselves as members of indigenous groups fell to 41% in the last census, in 2012, from 62% a decade earlier.

Texto completo: There was a bleak symmetry to the momentous events of this week.
On Wednesday, during the first day of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, Bill Taylor and George Kent, two State Department officials of impeccable credentials, explained how the president used foreign aid and the promise of a White House meeting to try to extort a vulnerable ally for help with his reelection.
Withholding security assistance from Ukraine “for no good reason other than help with a political campaign made no sense,” said Taylor, America’s top diplomat in that country. “It was counterproductive to all of what we had been trying to do. It was illogical. It could not be explained. It was crazy.” The hearing made it clear that Trump subverted foreign policy in order to cheat in the 2020 campaign.
Wednesday was also the day of closing arguments in the trial of Roger Stone, the longtime Trump associate charged with making false statements to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice in Congress’ investigation into Russian election interference.
During the trial, former Trump campaign chief executive Steve Bannon testified that he regarded Stone as the campaign’s “access point” to WikiLeaks, which published thousands of Democratic National Committee emails that were hacked by Russia. Former Trump campaign staffer Rick Gates testified that Trump spoke directly to Stone about WikiLeaks’ plans. Trump, in written testimony to special counsel Robert Mueller, said he remembered no such conversation. Stone seems to have exaggerated his WikiLeaks’ connections, but the trial made it clear that the Trump campaign tried hard to take advantage of Russian cybercrimes in the 2016 election, and that Trump lied about it.
After the impeachment hearing, some in the media appeared to yawn. Two Reuters reporters pronounced the proceedings “consequential, but dull,” writing, “Unlike the best reality TV shows — not to mention the Trump presidency itself — fireworks and explosive moments were scarce.” An NBC News analysis concluded that the hearing “felt more like the dress rehearsal for a serious one-act play than the opening night of a hit Broadway musical.”
It’s certainly true that there were few new revelations Wednesday, since transcripts of the witnesses’ closed-door testimony had already been released. But if the facts at hand have not shaken the country to its core, that’s not the fault of Democrats on the Intelligence Committee. The responsibility lies with us all for letting this lawless, kleptocratic presidency become normalized.
Like addicts to the world’s most unpleasant drug, our political class seems to require ever-greater jolts to feel anything at all. A month ago, some Republican senators were briefly roused from their submissive torpor by Trump’s cavalier decision to greenlight a Turkish attack on America’s Kurdish allies in Syria. Lindsey Graham, usually an obsequious Trump lackey, said that if the president didn’t change course, he was prepared to become Trump’s “worst nightmare.”
Trump did not change course on protecting the Kurds, and Wednesday he licked the boots of Turkey’s dictatorial president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, during an Oval Office meeting. But rather than rebelling, Graham fell in line. After the meeting, as if reveling in his own abasement, he decided to side with Erdogan and block a congressional resolution recognizing the Ottoman Empire’s Armenian genocide, a mass atrocity that Turkey furiously denies.
So it’s true: The Trumpian treachery revealed at the hearing Wednesday will not move immovable Republicans. Last month Graham told Axios that there were circumstances in which he might support impeachment. “If you could show me that, you know, Trump actually was engaging in a quid pro quo, outside the phone call, that would be very disturbing,” he said. Now that there is abundant evidence of just such a quid pro quo, Graham has moved the goal posts, saying that the inquiry is “invalid” unless the whistleblower who revealed Trump’s Ukraine scheme is outed.
But it is a monumental mistake to allow people who will accept anything from Trump to set our standards for acceptable public behavior. By any normal metric, this week’s news — the impeachment hearing, the Stone trial, the mortifying Erdogan meeting, not to mention new revelations of the senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller’s white nationalism — was sensational and historic. The fact that Republicans are insisting otherwise is a sign of the depths of our political crisis. Each one of us must choose whether to treat their mulish disloyalty to their fellow citizens as a given, worthy only of shrugs, or as a shocking affront that demands redoubled political action.
Faced with evidence of Trump’s crimes, a significant part of the right is trying to convince Americans that the president has been set up by Jewish philanthropist George Soros. The lurid McCarthyite fantasy that Soros controls U.S. diplomats has been a theme in this scandal from the beginning — Rudy Giuliani has pushed the idea repeatedly.
Now the claims are getting louder. On Wednesday night Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing, two attorneys who’ve served as conduits between Giuliani and corrupt Ukrainian interests, appeared on Lou Dobbs’ Fox Business show, where diGenova said, “There’s no doubt that George Soros controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department.” On Thursday, the white nationalist Rep. Steve King tweeted out a picture of Soros’ son, claiming, absurdly, that he was the whistleblower. (King later deleted it.)
These are the sort of anti-Semitic conspiracy theories that deform public life in squalid second-rate oligarchies like Russia and Hungary. In three short years, Republicans have allowed our country to sink to that level — indeed, to sink below it, since foreign authoritarians find it easy to manipulate our president, and scarcely seem to regard him as their equal.
There is nothing Democrats can do to make their Republican colleagues side with upstanding patriots like Taylor and Kent — who embody the virtues conservatives once venerated — over their dear leader and the mad rantings of his worshippers. All they can do is make plain the choice America faces between hewing to ideals that everyone in public life once at least pretended to revere, or consenting to their defilement. Either Americans will reclaim their birthright and become a liberal democracy again, or not. It’s up to all of us to decide how much we care about being entertained in the process.

Texto completo: California Democrat Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, has been in his glory in running the Trump impeachment (inquiry) hearings, with the TV spotlight upon him and his allies in Washington's Democratic Media Complex urging him on in this totally unnecessary farce.
Yet from his perch up high at the hearings, with that long neck and those pursed lips, I figure Schiff could have at least worn a black robe trimmed with fur. He presides over this absurdity like a medieval churchman in a bad movie, determined to burn all the witches and win the adoration of all those little people he finds beneath him.
Wasn't it only yesterday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thought going full impeachment on President Donald Trump was a political mistake? But now she's determined to take him down. And Lord High Inquisitor Schiff is indeed grateful. But what has this really accomplished?
It has already caused collateral damage to former Vice President Joe Biden, the moderate-left Democrat who once openly bragged on video about putting his thumbs on the scale of Ukrainian justice, while his son Hunter was doing questionable gas business in that famously corrupt country. Each day the Democrats pursue impeachment, Biden is weakened in the critical, early states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
You think Schiff's impeachment hearings don't hurt Biden? OK, then please tell it to Michael Bloomberg, the big gulp New York billionaire who is moving into the Biden breach. Another is former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, an African American born on the South Side of Chicago. He wants to cut into Biden's last remaining firewall among African American voters in South Carolina. Patrick doesn't make this move without a wink and nod from Biden's beloved boss, former President Barack Obama.
What Impeachment Theater tells us is that Democratic moderates have been overwhelmed by the left, now the dynamic force in their party. This was inevitable. Years ago, the Republican establishment collapsed of its own weight after all those jobs were sent overseas, and all the needless wars that cost American blood and treasure. The Bushies hoped to use Trump to suck up all the media oxygen, and then they'd slide in. They miscalculated. Trump was never the cause of the GOP establishment collapse, only the symptom of it. And now they hate him.
But back to Schiff and the farce in Washington. The hearings were full of Washington speak, the players mumbling what seemed like forgotten tongues about the sacred rights, feelings and prerogatives of federal bureaucrats who were irritated by the fact that they serve at the pleasure of a president many of them despise. Trump angrily tweeted at one diplomat who was there as a feeling witness, not a fact witness, but were Americans moved one way or another by the testimony? I don't think so.
The feelings of bureaucrats are important, yes, feelings are intensely important to the left now, and tears are even better, especially on TV, since they'd rather not talk about the economy or of Democratic presidential candidates wanting to impose government health care and strip private insurance from union workers in critical battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan.
The president sets foreign policy, not the unelected diplomats. Trump is accused of withholding aide to Ukraine unless Ukraine investigated the Bidens and reported Democratic intrigue in Ukraine running up to the 2016 election. Democrats now argue that this is bribery, and that foreign aide should not serve domestic political interest. But presidents always played it that way, with surrogates making end runs around the foreign policy bureaucracy in Washington.
Truman had his Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. Billions of American dollars have been given to Egypt, so it won't attack Israel. Obama gave millions of dollars in cash on pallets to Iran to sweeten the mullahs. One of his top foreign policy aides, Ben Rhodes, famously bragged to the New York Times about how easy it was to manipulate American journalists on the way to Obama's Iran nuclear deal.
Obama withheld anti-tank missiles promised to Ukraine. Why? Because he was president. He was elected to set foreign policy, even if that meant leaning over a hot mic in 2012 and tell Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to inform Russian boss Vladimir Putin that "after my election I have more flexibility." Was that smart? No.
Was it smart of Trump to call to the Ukrainian president and mention the Bidens? No. But he did it.
Is it impeachable? With an election less than a year away, is impeachment the orange hill that the Democrats should die upon? No.
Many of you will disagree. Many have and will offer reasonable counterarguments. Some of you might think the Schiff Show has been a valuable exercise in saving the republic just so that Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, can wreak their will upon it and upon the economy.
Trump's bombastic personality has been an issue from the moment he defeated the unlikable Hillary Clinton and sent the Washington establishment and their Beltway media palace guardians into absolute hysterics. They've been quite hysterical for three years.
You want to get rid of Donald Trump? You want to retain him? Here's what you do: Go to the polls next November and vote. That's how we do things.
It won't satisfy Adam Schiff, but then, he's always wanted to be a screenwriter. And he can write himself into another movie, and play the hero, once again.

FOR CHAZZ PALMINTERI, HIS 'BRONX TALE' RESONATES DUE TO ITS HONESTY

Texto completo: Chazz Palminteri has lived and relived his boyhood over and over again, first in his own one-man autobiographical show and then as a movie. Now his tale that is a little bit "Jersey Boys," a little bit "West Side Story" and "85-90% me" is coming to Pittsburgh.
So far, it's "A Bronx Tale" he hasn't tired of telling.
The Oscar-nominated actor and writer was reliving it again in October, when he came to Pittsburgh to promote the national tour of the hit Broadway musical.
Over dinner at the Fairmont's fl. 2 restaurant, the conversation ranged from his life story, to the "anguish" he felt when the Pirates beat his Yankees, to his visits to Pittsburgh, past and recent - past, to film the movie "Diabolique" with Sharon Stone; recent, as his college-bound daughter checks out a local university.
In case you missed the nuts and bolts of his personal tale, it follows Calogero - Chazz's given name - from pre-tween through his teen years, when he falls for a black classmate and their forbidden romance puts him at odds with his tough-guy, racist friends and a brewing turf war between bordering black and Italian neighborhoods. This comes as he is caught in a tug-of-war between his honorable bus-driver father (Robert De Niro in the movie version) and the flashy gangster, Sonny (played by Palminteri in the film), who recruits "C," as he calls Calogero, into his business.
What does Palminteri, 67, look for when casting the part of, well, himself - besides youngsters who can sing and dance?
"I was a street guy, but I had an artist's soul. I wanted to be a writer, and I wanted to act. But I couldn't really talk about that to my friends," said the actor, who trained with Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio in New York.
He switches from himself to the character, adding, "But he's not a wimp; he's a tough kid. So you have to have that sensitivity, and you have to have an edge, too."
"A Bronx Tale" began as a one-man show that the actor performed in Los Angeles, before it became a hot Hollywood property to bring to the screen. He turned down offers because, like Sylvester Stallone and "Rocky," Palminteri wanted to write the screenplay himself and play the role of Sonny, the local mob boss who takes young Calorgero under his wing.
Palminteri brought the solo show to New York, after De Niro became a fan. He also finished the screenplay and went on to star in the 1993 movie opposite De Niro, who chose the script for his directorial debut.
Palminteri said he "always" thought it could be a musical, because it was a love story with the rich themes that have inspired so many of the classics.
After some starts and stops, music executive Tommy Mottola, said Palminteri, "is the one who really put it on his back. ... I always say, Bob De Niro made the movie happen. Tommy Mottola made the musical happen."
The team that came together is a who's who of musical theater: De Niro co-directing with four-time Tony winner Jerry Zaks, songs by Oscar winner Alan Menken and Glenn Sater, and choreography by Tony winner Sergio Trujillo.
Menken is best-known for his Disney scores, but he also wrote the '60s-inspired pop score for "Little Shop of Horrors." The music in "A Bronx Tale," which takes place in the 1960s, samples sounds of the decade and opens with street-corner doo-wop.
Palminteri, who has an Oscar nomination as a supporting actor for "Bullets Over Broadway," remembered working on the 2004 movie "Noel," his directorial debut, with Menken and Stephen Schwartz. "And I felt like I had grown up on Alan Menken's music because my kids would watch 'Little Mermaid' and 'Aladdin.' And I said, 'Those are fables. "A Bronx Tale" is a fable. He's right for it.'"
Working with Menken and Slater, "every day was just magic," Palminteri said. The show went from in-development to Broadway in less than four years.
"A Bronx Tale" on Broadway was a New York Times Editor's Pick. It didn't get any Tonys love, but audiences kept coming. The familiar title and word of mouth carried the show through 700 performances over two years, starting in December 2016. Nick Cordero was the breakout star as Sonny - a role that Palminteri also played when Cordero left for a screen role.
Palminteri wasn't surprised at the musical's success. It's a story that attracts loyal fans and repeat business, "the same as the one-man show, the same as the movie.
"It resonates," he continued, "because the characters are archetypes, and it's about their choices, about not wasting their lives. It's just honest, you know?"
And how's this for honesty: When he realized that Pittsburgh audiences are likely to cheer the moment in the show when young Calogero is inconsolable over the Yankees' 1960 loss to the Pirates, he turns from his meal and gets visibly excited. The idea that he could meet Bill Mazeroski, whose walk-off homer beat his Yankees, brings out both his sensitivity and his edge.
"Is Bill Mazeroski still in Pittsburgh?" (He lives in Florida.) "He has to come to the show!" Palminteri said. "I have to look the man in the eye who caused me so much anguish!"
He pauses. "So people in Pittsburgh will cheer at that," he says finally. Even after reliving that moment again and again onstage, he realizes, "I never thought of that."

In praise of Washington insiders

Texto completo: Let me tell you a secret. The public buildings of Washington are filled with very good people working hard for low pay and the public good. There are thousands of them and they are very much like the Foreign Service officers that we've seen or are expected to see testifying at the impeachment hearings: William Taylor, George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Fiona Hill.
These public servants tend to be self-effacing and deeply knowledgeable about some small realm of public policy. They're generally not all that interested in partisan politics but are deeply committed to the process and substance of good government. Whenever I get to sit in on off-the-record meetings at this or that federal agency, I'm impressed by the quality, professionalism and basic goodness of the people there.
We don't celebrate these people. Trumpian conservatives say that Washington insiders are unelected bureaucrats, denizens of the swamp, the cesspool or a snake pit. Some progressives call Washington insiders the establishment, the power elite, the privileged structures of the status quo.
Everybody who runs for office wants to be seen as an outsider and condemns the insiders. That is, until weeks like this one when we realize how much we need them.
At this week's hearings, the civil servant witnesses answering questions inspired a lot more confidence than the elected officials who were asking them. Why are they so impressive? It's precisely because they are Washington insiders. The witnesses have worked in a long line of institutions - the State Department, the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, the National Security Council.
For all their flaws, these institutions possess what political scientist Hugh Heclo called "sedimented deposits" of inherited knowledge. If you are a Foreign Service officer long enough, you learn to think like a Foreign Service officer. You absorb the skills, practices and moral codes you need to do the work well. When someone breaks the code, you know immediately, and if you are brave enough, like the whistleblower, you move to defend the code.
When public servants enter government, they shed their private interests to serve a public role. A great question of the Trump years is whether our institutions can survive a president who is incapable of thinking outside his own private interest. Donald Trump uses public office as a gold mine to extract personal advantage.
As Yuval Levin writes in his profound forthcoming book, "A Time to Build," Trump is an example of a person who wasn't formed by an institution. He is self-created and self-enclosed. He governs as a perpetual outsider, tweeting insults to members of his own Cabinet. At its best, the impeachment process is an attempt to protect our institutions from his inability to obey the rules.
The wider disease here is "outsiderism" itself. For a half-century our culture has celebrated the rebel, not the organization man; the free individual, not the institutionalist. That's fine and in many cases good, but over the decades this outsider pose has hardened into an immature cynicism: Everybody's corrupt. No one is to be trusted.
"The populism of this moment in our politics is fundamentally antinomian, mistrustful of authority, and cynical about all claims to integrity," Levin writes in "A Time to Build." "Our age combines a populism that insists all of our institutions are rigged against the people with an identity politics that rejects institutional commitments and a celebrity culture that chafes against all structure and constraint."
All around the world voters are electing comedians, celebrities and outsider performers to high office. All around the world people are responding to demagogues who tell them that our problems are easy to solve if we just get rid of the bad people. Everywhere rule-breakers like Trump, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Nicolás Maduro are in power and corruption is in the air.
People have messed-up theories of how you do social change. On the right many think that you need to elect some authoritarian strongman who will whip everybody into shape. On the left many put their faith in social movements, without explaining how social movements are going to write and pass legislation.
In reality, institutions are the only vehicles for legislative change. That's because they are the way to wield power safely. They have rules and structures and norms precisely because power is so dangerous when it is wielded by a lone strongman or by a mob.
People have lost faith in institutions for some very good reasons, and the need to reform them is urgent. But the disenchantment is overblown and self-destructive. We don't pay enough attention to all the planes that take off and land safely. We underestimate the value of experience. As Heclo writes in "On Thinking Institutionally," "It is when you deal with someone who does not perform in a professional' manner that you learn to appreciate those who do."
Watching Taylor and Kent, I had a feeling of going back in time. Why did it feel so strange? It was because I was looking at people who are not self-centered. They've dedicated themselves to the organization that formed them, and which they serve.

Planned Parenthood awarded more than $2 Million in lawsuit over secret videos

Texto completo: Planned Parenthood was awarded as much as $2.2 million in damages on Friday, after a federal jury in San Francisco ruled that an anti-abortion activist had broken federal and state laws when he secretly recorded workers for the organization.
The activist, David R. Daleiden, recorded the videos in 2015 in an attempt to show that Planned Parenthood was illegally selling fetal tissue, a claim that created a political uproar and mobilized conservatives against the organization.
Daleiden, leader of a group called the Center for Medical Progress, posed as a biotechnology representative to make the recordings. The jury found that he had trespassed on private property and committed fraud, according to court papers.
Planned Parenthood said in a statement that the jury had ruled in its favor on each of its claims, including a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.
Harmeet Dhillon, one of the lawyers for Daleiden, said: “We’re disappointed with the jury verdict, but this is not the last word on the case. We will be appealing numerous aspects of the verdict and the judge’s ruling.”
She added that “we believe we have excellent grounds for reversal.”
The ruling was a victory for Planned Parenthood, which had been buffeted by the political fallout from the videos, whose release in the summer of 2015 incited widespread outrage.
The videos gave new strength to the conservative drive to defund Planned Parenthood. Missouri called a special legislative session to do so after their release. The organization was forced to apologize for the casual tone that one of its officials had used in a video to discuss a possible transfer of fetal tissue to what she believed was a legitimate medical company. Planned Parenthood said the fees being discussed were to cover costs and were legal.
Opponents of abortion claimed that the videos revealed that Planned Parenthood was engaged in the illegal sale of body parts. The organization has denied the charge, which has not been supported in numerous congressional and state investigations prompted by the release of the videos.
Planned Parenthood said in a statement that Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress had “intentionally waged a multiyear illegal effort to manufacture a malicious campaign.” The organization added that “the jury recognized today that those behind the campaign broke the law in order to advance their goals of banning safe, legal abortion in this country.”
Daleiden’s supporters argued that the case was about freedom of speech. Daleiden was working, effectively, as an undercover journalist, they said, and should be protected by the First Amendment.
The Center for Medical Progress said on Twitter that the verdict set “a dangerous precedent for citizen journalism and First Amendment civil rights across the country.”
In early 2016, Planned Parenthood sued the center, Daleiden and other opponents of abortion involved in the videos. The suit accused them of engaging in a three-year criminal enterprise to target the group.
Around the same time, a grand jury in Harris County, Texas, indicted Daleiden and another Center for Medical Progress employee, Sandra S. Merritt. Daleiden and Merritt were charged with making and presenting fake California driver’s licenses, with the intent to defraud, for their April meeting at a Planned Parenthood location in Houston. Texas authorities later dismissed those charges.

Texto completo: City, the Premier League champion, had tried to block an investigation into its finances by appealing to sports' highest court even before a punishment was handed down.
MONTREUX, Switzerland -- An attempt by Manchester City to block an investigation into its finances and spending was rejected Friday by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which ruled that the club's appeal was "inadmissible" because European soccer officials have not yet issued a ruling in the case.
Investigators from UEFA, the sport's governing body in Europe, have spent months looking into possible violations of the organization's so-called financial fair play rules. Those rules, in place since 2011, were devised to impose a measure of financial fairness within the European soccer economy by linking spending to revenues, but powerful clubs have routinely avoided serious punishment for breaking them.
Manchester City, the reigning Premier League champion, had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in June, about a month after The New York Times reported that UEFA investigators were seeking at least a one-season ban of the club from the Champions League, European's soccer biggest and richest club competition. City has contended that UEFA acted incorrectly in assigning its case to the governing body's financial crimes unit.
CAS officials stressed that Friday's decision was not a verdict on any of the underlying accusations against Manchester City.
"There was absolutely no examination of the merits," the CAS secretary general, Matthieu Reeb, told reporters. "It's just jurisdiction and admissibility and nothing else. So we cannot say whether the decision of the alleged breach of the financial fair play rules are real or not."
Friday's decision puts City's fate back in the hands of UEFA's financial fair play judge, who could still decide to impose a ban from the Champions League, the trophy Manchester City and its United Arab Emirates-financed owners covet most.
Many of the most serious allegations of rule-breaking by Manchester City have emerged through damaging leaks to the news media over the past several years. Manchester City has vigorously denied wrongdoing, and its officials have warned UEFA that the club would mount an aggressive response to any effort to bar it from the Champions League.
"The accusation of financial irregularities are entirely false," City said in a statement earlier this year.

Texto completo: A surrealist series about female friendship hits Hulu, and Jesse Metcalfe and Autumn Reeser star in a Hallmark holiday love story.
What's Streaming
DOLLFACE Stream on Hulu. In this new sitcom, Kat Dennings plays Jules, a woman who works to rekindle her female friendships after a breakup. The story swings in and out of Jules's reality and her internal fantasy world, tackling social anxiety and breakup etiquette with a surrealistic flair that echoes shows like "Lodge 49": Paramedics arrive after Jules accidentally likes her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend's Instagram post, and she finds herself on a game show called "Should She Go Out?" The 10-episode series is executive produced by Margot Robbie, and also stars Brenda Song from "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" and Shay Mitchell from "Pretty Little Liars." Writing about the show for The New York Times, Jennifer Vineyard said Mitchell's character "is the Samantha of this show -- which is to say, she's absolutely fabulous."
I'M WITH THE BAND: NASTY CHERRY Stream on Netflix. Charli XCX is using her status and expertise as a global pop sensation to help this female alt-pop foursome navigate the music industry. This six-part series follows Gabbriette Bechtel, Chloe Chaidez, Debbie Knox-Hewson and Georgia Somary, a mix of seasoned and first-time musicians Charli XCX selected for the project, who live and record together as the band Nasty Cherry.
SUFFRAGETTE (2015) Stream on Netflix. This film directed by Sarah Gavron is about women's right to vote, but it also makes "a series of arguments about the workings of patriarchal power, the complexities of political resistance and the economic implications" of that right, Manohla Dargis writes in her New York Times review. Carey Mulligan, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne-Marie Duff portray working-class women swept up in the British suffragist movement in 1912, a cause spearheaded by Emmeline Pankhurst, who is played by Meryl Streep. As the fight reaches a boiling point, Maud Watts (Mulligan), an industrial laundry worker, is forced to make sacrifices for the cause.
What's on TV
CHRISTMAS UNDER THE STARS 8 p.m. on Hallmark. The Hallmark Channel's annual holiday programming is already in full swing. Two actors known for their roles in mid-2000s teen hits -- Jesse Metcalfe of "John Tucker Must Die" and Autumn Reeser of "The O.C." -- team up again for their second Hallmark movie together, after "A Country Wedding" (2015). In that film, Metcalfe played a successful country music singer, but this time around he is a down-on-his-luck investment banker named Nick, who starts working at his local Christmas-tree lot after losing his job. Reeser plays his love interest, Julie, an astronomy teacher, who inspires Nick to be more selfless.
SESAME STREET 9 a.m. on HBO. In the premiere of the 50th season of this long-running children's show, Big Bird leaves Sesame Street to embark on a nationwide road trip, stopping in cities to ask kids what they love about their communities. Later on in the season, the gang tackles the pressures that some preschool children are under to meet academic benchmarks.

Chicago churches join growing movement of congregations paying off medical debt

Texto completo: CHICAGO - This Thanksgiving, 5,888 families in Cook County, III., will receive a card with the names of several congregations belonging to different Protestant Christian denominations throughout the city of Chicago and these words: "Have a wonderful Thanksgiving. We want you to know that all your debts have been forgiven."
The churches don't mean that merely theologically.
Together, the congregations paid off $5.3 million in medical debt for "the poorest of the poor" - many in Chicago's South Side neighborhoods of Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Washington Heights, Roseland and West Pullman, according to the Rev. Otis Moss III, senior pastor of the historic Trinity United Church of Christ.
Trinity UCC, a congregation of 8,500 founded in 1961 in Washington Heights, is the first African-American church in the UCC and counts former President Obama among its past members.
"We believe this is a moment of Jubilee for our community - a moment of Jubilee for our nation, where we reset the moral compass of our nation and for some of our churches that have lost their way in reference to the waves and the undertow of our current political situation in this nation," Rev. Moss said at a celebration Oct. 20 announcing the churches' donation.
The pastor said the idea came several months ago from a conversation he had with the Rev. Traci Blackmon of the UCC. The two were discussing how they could engage their communities and "plotting some holy mischief"
When the conversation turned to an article in The New York Times about a nonprofit called RIP Medical Debt.
"I thought, 'What an incredible program!' Instead of allowing debt collectors to purchase the debt, why not have communities of faith purchase that debt and forgive that debt?" Rev. Moss said.
For every dollar Chicago churches donated, RIP Medical Debt was able to purchase and abolish about $142 worth of debt, according to Rev. Blackmon, the UCC's associate general minister of justice and local church ministries. The average amount of debt they "forgave" was $970, she said, which cost the churches just $7, allowing their donations of $38,000 to cancel more than $5 million of debt.
"I'm glad that we could do it. But there's absolutely no reason why people should be held hostage so that other people can be enriched on their backs," Rev. Blackmon said.
The Chicago churches join a growing trend of congregations paying off medical debt for the people in their communities and beyond. At least 18 other churches have done the same from the start of 2018 to the end of May, forgiving $34.4 million in debt through RIP Medical Debt. Even comedian John Oliver paid off nearly $15 million in medical debt through the non-profit in an episode of his HBO show "Last Week Tonight" (though not on behalf of the satiric televangelism ministry he also started for another episode of the show, Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption).
Joe Antos, a health care policy scholar for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, raised red flags for congregations wanting to pay off medical debt for their members earlier this year in an article in Christianity Today.
They are "well-meaning," but, Mr. Antos told Religion News Service, "Generally churches do not have expertise in health financing."
RIP Medical Debt co-founders Craig Antico and Jerry Ashton do. Both had worked in debt collections for years until realizing who was impacted and how "destructive" it was for them, Mr. Antico said.
"It became abundantly clear: Why don't we do what we did with our business life and just do it for good?" Mr. Antico said.
RIP Medical Debt, which was founded in 2014, purchases "portfolios" of medical debt from health care providers and from the secondary debt market at an average $1 for $100 of medical debt, according to its website.
Those providers sell the debt at pennies on the dollar to try to recoup some of the cost of those unpaid bills. Usually, those who buy that debt then continue to bill people for it.
RIP Medical Debt instead abolishes the debt, with no tax consequences or strings attached for the recipients, according to its site.
The New York-based nonprofit brought in just $3,000 in its first year, according to Mr. Antico. But donations exploded after RIP Medical Debt appeared on "Last Week Tonight," he said. It quickly raised $250,000, and donations have continued to grow since then.
Mr. Antico said he expects the nonprofit to raise $10 million this year and cross $1 billion total forgiven in a matter of weeks - the goal it set when it started, he said.
Churches have played a huge role in that growth, according to the co-founder. RIP Medical Debt worked with more than 70 faith-based groups this year alone, according to the Chicago Tribune.
"It's nonpartisan or non-political, and Republicans, Democrats, progressives can all agree on this," Mr. Antico said.
"And churches - they all agree that their mission is to help their people get through hard times and be resilient and let people start over again and know that they're supported. I think that's the key here. They care so much about people and their community and that's why it's resonating."
UCC churches across the country will make medical debt relief the focus of their Giving Tuesday campaigns on Tuesday, Dec. 3, Rev. Blackmon announced.
"This is not the end. This is the beginning. We are using this as a sacred launching pad in the United Church of Christ," she said

Trump calls impeachment witnesses ‘Never Trumpers’

Texto completo: As the first day of public impeachment hearings began with testimony from William Taylor and George Kent, President Donald Trump attacked the two senior foreign-policy officials at the hearing as implacable foes.
“The Impeachment Scam hearings begin today! This is a complete Fake Hearing (trial) to interview Never Trumpers and a Pelosi-Schiff SCAM against the Republican Party and me,” Trump said in a blast fundraising email. What caught our eye was the notion that Taylor and Kent were “Never Trumpers.”
We’ve found no evidence that either Taylor or Kent qualify under any reasonable definition of “Never Trumpers.” (Neither the Trump campaign nor the White House responded to inquiries for this article.)
The careers of Kent and Taylor
Nothing in Taylor’s or Kent’s biographies shows they have strong political views. They have been in government for decades, serving under presidents of both parties.
Taylor is the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, a role known as the chargé d’affaires. A career diplomat and U.S. Army veteran, he has worked in every administration since 1985, including most recently as the ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009.
Kent is a career foreign-service officer who currently oversees State Department policy towards Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
From 2015 to 2018, Kent served as deputy chief of mission in Kyiv. Previously, he served as the senior anti-corruption coordinator in the State Department’s European Bureau. From 2012 to 2014, he directed the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. His earlier foreign service postings have included Warsaw; Kyiv; Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and Bangkok.
Notably, both Taylor and Kent continue to serve in the Trump administration, and Trump officials named them to their current posts.
What is a Never Trumper?
The term “Never Trumper” came to prominence during the 2016 election to refer to individuals, especially Republicans, who were unhappy that Trump was the GOP nominee.
Liz Mair, one of the early leaders of the Never Trump movement, said she would define Never Trumper as “a Republican who a) voted for Hillary Clinton b) voted third-party c) cast a write-in vote or d) refused to vote in 2016 and has not subsequently reversed course by expressing support for Trump, working for the Trump administration, donating to Trump, endorsing him in 2020, or contemplating voting for him in 2020.”
Often, the term has been used in reference to historically Republican or nonpartisan foreign policy officials and advisers who refused to join the Trump administration if he were to win the 2016 election.
At times, such officials publicly signed their names to letters. One of them, circulated by foreign-policy expert Eliot A. Cohen and others, said that “as committed and loyal Republicans, we are unable to support a party ticket with Mr. Trump at its head. We commit ourselves to working energetically to prevent the election of someone so utterly unfitted to the office.”
That letter included 122 signatures, none of which belong to Taylor or Kent.
A second letter, published in the New York Times, said, “None of us will vote for Donald Trump. From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be President and Commander-in-Chief. Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous President and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.”
None of the 50 signatories were Taylor or Kent.
Tom Nichols, a U.S. Naval War College professor in national security affairs who has become a prominent Never Trump voice, told PolitiFact that he considers it “laughable” to call either Taylor or Kent a Never Trumper.
“This makes no sense to me and seems to be an appellation applied to anyone Trump doesn’t like after the fact,“ he said.
Our ruling
Trump said Taylor and Kent are “Never Trumpers.” We rate the statement False.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to block a subpoena for his tax returns, in a test of the president's ability to defy investigations.
The filing Thursday sets the stage for a high court showdown over the tax returns Trump has refused to release, unlike every other modern president. The justices also could weigh in more broadly on Trump's claim that sitting presidents can't be prosecuted or investigated for crimes.
The subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney is seeking Trump's tax returns back to 2011 from his accounting firm as part of a criminal investigation. Trump's lawyers say a criminal probe of the president at the state or local level is unconstitutional and unprecedented in American history.
Lower courts have rejected Trump's claims of immunity.
The Supreme Court justices may not decide whether to hear the case for at least another month.
A second, similar case is headed to the court over a House committee subpoena demanding Trump's financial records from the same accounting firm. The president has lost both cases at each step of the judicial system so far. The Mazars USA firm has said it will comply with the subpoenas, if courts agree.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is seeking the records in a broader probe that includes payments made to buy the silence of two women, adult film actress Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal, who claim they had affairs with Trump before the 2016 election. Trump has denied the claims.
Brexit Party fails to clinch voting pact with Conservatives
LONDON - Britain's Brexit Party has failed to reach a tactical voting pact with the ruling Conservatives, saying Thursday that it will field 300 candidates in next month's election to force Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his promise of a clean break with the European Union.
Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage said the party had to contest the seats in Britain's Dec. 12 election to keep the pressure on Johnson, rebuffing Conservative arguments that doing so risks splitting the pro-Brexit vote and boosts parties that want to remain in the EU.
Britain is holding a national election on Dec. 12 because Johnson wants to secure a majority so he can take the U.K. out of the bloc.
Johnson reached a Brexit deal with the EU but has not persuaded enough British lawmakers to pass it.
Pastor: Jimmy Carter 'up and walking' post brain surgery
ATLANTA - Former President Jimmy Carter was already "up and walking" just a day after undergoing surgery to relieve pressure on his brain from bleeding linked to recent falls, his pastor said.
The Rev. Tony Lowden visited Carter, 95, in an Atlanta hospital on Wednesday.
"His spirits are good and he is up and walking," Lowden told reporters.
Carter Center spokeswoman Deanna Congileo has said there were no complications during Carter's Tuesday surgery at Emory University Hospital for a subdural hematoma, blood trapped on the brain's surface.
The center said the bleeding was connected to Carter's recent falls. A Spring fall required Carter to get hip replacement surgery. He fell twice in October, hitting his head at least once.
Trump Jr.'s book is a No. 1 bestseller, but with an edge
NEW YORK - Donald Trump Jr.'s "Triggered" is a No. 1 New York Times bestseller, although not without an edge.
"Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" came out last week and tops the hardcover nonfiction list that will appear in the Times on Nov. 24.
A dagger symbol appears next to the listing, indicating that some of the sales were "bulk purchases," often meaning that the author or someone associated with the author bought a substantial number of copies. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee, Steve Guest, said the RNC has been offering "Triggered" as a fundraising incentive, a common practice for political books.
Guest said copies were bought "to keep up with demand," not in a "large bulk purchase."
North Korea: US offers to restart nuclear talks
SEOUL, South Korea - North Korea on Thursday said the United States has proposed a resumption of stalled nuclear negotiations in December as they approach an end-of-year deadline set by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer an acceptable deal to salvage the talks.
In a statement released by state media, North Korean negotiator Kim Myong Gil didn't clearly say whether the North would accept the supposed U.S. offer.
He said North Korea has no interest in talks aimed at buying time without discussing solutions. He said the North isn't willing to make a deal over "matters of secondary importance," such as possible U.S. offers to formally declare an end to the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted by a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, or establish a liaison office between the nations.
US implores EU nations to retake fighters from IS group
WASHINGTON - European and other members of the international coalition fighting the Islamic State group must take back and prosecute their nationals detained in Iraq and Syria to help keep IS from regaining territory, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Thursday.
Pompeo told foreign ministers and senior officials from about 30 coalition members that it's imperative that they hold thousands of detained foreign fighters accountable for atrocities committed while IS held swathes of territory in the two countries.
Many of the detained foreign fighters are from Europe, but countries have been reluctant to take them back and officials acknowledged there are still differences of opinion among coalition partners about how best to deal with them.
In South Carolina: A school shooter who was 14 when he killed a first grader on a school playground in South Carolina after killing his father in their home was sentenced Thursday to life in prison without parole.
Jesse Osborne, now 17, crashed his father's pickup truck into the fence on Sept. 28, 2016 and fired on first graders at Townville Elementary School celebrating a classmate's birthday.
But Osborne's lawyers noted he never tried to get inside the school, even though police took 12 minutes to arrive.
Osborne, who was tried as an adult, had left a video chat open on his cellphone and witnesses said he was pacing outside, crying and saying he was sorry. Jacob Hill, 6, was killed.

Texto completo: Arthur Hourihan passed away peacefully at his parents' home on November 2, 2019 at the age of 58 years. Arthur was born July 4, 1961 in Hartford, Connecticut, the oldest son of Arthur and Arline (Everin) Hourihan. He attended public schools in Newington, Connecticut prior to graduating from Central Connecticut State University with a degree in Environmental Science. His interest in the outdoors led him to follow a life close to nature. Arthur spent a good portion of his life as a commercial fisherman in Seattle, Washington, and Seward and Anchorage, Alaska. After his fishing career, he became a licensed Alaskan electrician, which had him live in several remote areas in Alaska. He had a home in Seward and he also resided in Anchorage and Noatak, Alaska. Arthur was a kind person who cared deeply for others. His actions throughout his life were a testament of his altruistic side. He was extremely bright and had a lifelong interest in learning coupled with a quest for knowledge. His love of the outdoors carried him to Alaska, where he met and married the love of his life - Victoria Nellie Onalik of Noatak, Alaska. They spent their 15 plus years together in several locations in Alaska. The people of Victoria's home village of Noatak embraced and loved Arthur as one of their own and considered him a brother. He was truly loved by all who knew him. Arthur loved the arts and music, especially "The Grateful Dead" and never missed a show or even individual band members on tour. Reading the Sunday New York Times cover to cover with several cups of good coffee and riding his bike in all places he dropped his duffel bag were his simple joys. Arthur enjoyed travelling and taking road trips, both long and short, to see new or familiar places. He shared this passion for road trips with his mother and stepson in the final months of his life. He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Victoria, who passed away in October 2017 with Arthur at her side after a courageous battle with cancer. Arthur was also preceded in death by his father, Arthur Francis Hourihan Jr. He is survived by his mother, Arline Everin Hourihan. Arthur leaves behind his mother-in-law, Hannah Onalik; his stepson, Harry Hank Onalik; his brother-in-laws Phillip and George Onalik and his sister-in-law Georgia Onalik of Noatak, Alaska.

Letts comes up aces in role as the 'Deuce' in 'Ford v Ferrari'

Texto completo: "Ford v Ferrari" stars a couple of Oscar winners named Matt Damon and Christian Bale, who are exceptionally good as two racing rebels fighting the corporate mindset in the midst of Ford Motor Co.'s quest to win the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race.
That's why it's even more impressive that Tracy Letts -- who has a supporting role as Henry Ford II, the ultimate 1960s CEO -- dominates every scene he's in.
Imposing, inflexible and blunt, Letts is mesmerizing as Ford rails about "getting it in the tailpipe from Chevy Impala" and orders Carroll Shelby (Damon) to "go to war" against Ferrari. When rising young executive Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) initially urges Ford to take on European racing, Iacocca says, "James Bond does not drive a Ford, sir."
"That's because he's a degenerate," retorts the man nicknamed in the press as "Hank the Deuce."
Don't be surprised if Letts becomes a favorite on Oscar prediction lists. The Gold Derby awards site has praised his performance in "Ford v Ferrari," noting, "It's the kind of supporting role Oscars were made for: a transformative, scene-stealing portrait of a real historical figure."
The 54-year-old Letts already has nabbed some top honors.
The Steppenwolf Theatre ensemble member, actor and playwright has won a Pulitzer for writing "August: Osage County" and a Tony for his performance in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" He's probably best known to moviegoers for his roles as the dad in "Lady Bird" and a newspaper executive in "The Post."
Letts currently has one play on Broadway, the midlife-crisis comedy/drama "Linda Vista," and another opening March 15, the politically themed "The Minutes," in which he'll play the mayor of a divided city.
During a phone interview, he admits that he gets "asked to play a lot of hard-asses, guys in suits and stuff like that."
He credits the strength of the screenplay of "Ford v Ferrari" (co-written by another acclaimed playwright, Jez Butterworth) -- and, in particular, moments such as Ford's weeping meltdown after riding in the GT40 race car -- as the reason he wanted to do the movie.
Letts appreciated "the fact that that scene gave an opportunity to show the vulnerability of this guy, to show a human side."
In real life, Henry Ford II was a titan of industry and a familiar icon for Detroiters, who knew him as a businessman, philanthropist and celebrity who moved in jet-set circles.
When Ford died in 1987 at 70, the New York Times noted that he would settle arguments by saying, "My name is on the building." During his career, he presided over great successes for the company and notable failures, including the flop of the Edsel car.
Beyond his corporate legacy, Ford also played a big role in Detroit civic life, supporting social reform and striving to help revive Detroit's downtown after the 1967 rebellion with the massive Renaissance Center on the riverfront.
Ford also was a society figure in gossip columns known for hearty partying. After a drunk driving arrest in the 1970s, he famously commented, "Never complain, never explain."
Letts recalls a recent fancy gala dinner where he and his wife, actress Carrie Coons, chatted about "Ford v Ferrari" with a woman at his table.
"I mentioned Henry Ford (II) and she said, 'Oh, well, we know the Fords!' " Letts says. "We said, 'Oh wow, you do?' And she said, as a way of explanation, 'Well, we're from Michigan.' "
Not everyone here is friends with the Fords, but it sometimes feels as if we are. And Detroiters are likely to appreciate Letts as Ford and the complexities he brings to the part.
"I tried to give it an essence of a guy who is certainly a titan of industry," Letts says. "By all accounts, Henry Ford II was a larger-than-life figure but also a guy who feels the weight of his legacy, the idea that his name is Henry Ford, of all things. It's his name on the car.
"He deals with pressures that the rest of us can only imagine."
Letts admits he was able to do a limited amount of research. He read some books, watched old clips of Ford at news conferences and saw a documentary commissioned by Ford.
"The truth is the script was really well-written, and so much of what I needed to know in order to play the part was on the page," Letts says. "Jim Mangold, the director, and I talked about it. We didn't see the need to try to do a Henry Ford II impersonation. ... He's not Johnny Cash or Elvis or something, where to be too far off would be disorienting to the audience."
Letts credits the meticulously researched sets and wardrobe -- Ford's office is a mammoth, wood-paneled space with an elaborate cocktail bar, very "Mad Men" -- with helping him transform into the Deuce.
"One of the great things about making 'Ford v Ferrari' was how much of the work was done for us," says Letts "And one of the ways it was done is the movie is very tactile. Everything is solid. We weren't acting with green screens. The cars are real. Everything is real.
"The first thing I shot was in that office. I put on my suit and I got the haircut. I walked on the set and saw that office and said, 'My work is done. ... I can just sit here and be the most powerful person in the room.' "
In real life, Ford was proud of his epic push for a Le Mans victory and the GT40 that made it possible. In 1966, before the first Ford victory, he told Sports Illustrated that advances spurred by the development of that race car had been incorporated into passenger vehicles and trucks and would continue to be.
"We call our GT cars 'laboratories on wheels,' " he bragged.
Yet it was a long, hard road to victory with some devastating setbacks. Letts captures that wonderfully in a scene where the Deuce sits silent and immobile opposite an empty chair, waiting to hear a disappointing update from Damon's Shelby, the iconic race car designer who joined the GT40 project.
Shelby sits down next to Ford instead of choosing the hot seat, but Ford keeps staring unflinchingly ahead. Letts said he and Damon just happened to choose those spots in the first rehearsal.
"Jim told me later (that) he said, 'I looked at it and said "Jesus, is this going to work, these two guys not looking at each other?" 'But the more he looked at it, the more he realized, 'Oh, it is going to work and I want to shoot it like that.' It seemed like an interesting way to play it"
Letts didn't spend time in Detroit or visit Ford's sprawling Dearborn campus before the movie. Filming was done in California. The scene where he's driven to tears after experiencing the GT40's speed was done at an airport in the city of Ontario.
Does Letts think the automotive company would invite him inside its headquarters?
"I would hope so," he says.
At Monday's Hollywood premiere, Letts got an indication that he might be let in the door. He met a few descendants of the Deuce before the screening in what he describes as a pleasant encounter. Among those attending the event was William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford.
"A couple of members of the Ford family came up and spoke to me, and I have to say they were very good sports about all of it," says Letts, who mischievously clarifies that he didn't talk to them after the screening.

COMMENTARY; LACMA has no one else to blame; Stalled fundraising could be the result of tepid reaction to new museum plans.

Texto completo: Over the past 16 months, Los Angeles County Museum of Art fund raising to erect a controversial new building, replacing most of its Wilshire Boulevard campus, has virtually ground to a halt. Four-fifths of the $650 million needed had been pledged by summer 2018, but next to nothing has been raised since.
It gets worse.
Last spring, three people close to the project and with knowledge of the budget discussions have told me, LACMA switched gears: In-house, the museum stopped using the $650-million figure as the new building's expected cost. For internal planning purposes, the people said, senior staff was told that the number now in play is $750 million.

LACMA's crumbling infrastructure is a genuine predicament. But weak philanthropy, a longtime but misleading L.A. stereotype, is not the reason the museum's funding campaign has stalled. Instead, the weakness is in a poor idea that has met escalating costs.
The new plan is to convert some of the permanent collection into temporary theme shows in a building that is actually smaller than what already exists -- the Incredible Shrinking Museum -- while outsourcing other parts of the LACMA collection to ill-defined future satellites to be scattered around the county. The distinctive value of an encyclopedic collection, which brings global art together in one place, gets undermined. What has taken half a century of curatorial and philanthropic labor to assemble is about to be dissolved.
To house the new program, a building was commissioned from Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. The aesthetically uninspired design went through numerous revisions over 13 years. Now composed of a single story, organic form in concrete, raised on piers to span Wilshire, its periphery ringed in glass with curtains provided to control the California sunshine, it has garnered scant critical support.
The usual explanation for fundraising under-performance would involve L.A.'s hoary reputation as a tough town for large-scale cultural philanthropy. A $650-million or $750-million project is not small.
The actual explanation for the shortfall, however, seems to lie elsewhere. Before we get to the details, a few salient facts:
Just days before the museum's recent Art + Film Gala, a glittery annual extravaganza held to raise money to underwrite programs, a LACMA spokesperson told The Times that pledges for the new building stood at $560 million. During the event itself, Michael Govan, the museum's director, nudged the number upward a bit, saying the campaign is "pushing $580 million."
Whichever number is correct, the accounting is grim.
In July 2018, the fundraising tally was reported to be $550 million. By the end of the year, just $10 million was added. Sluggishness had set in.
Because Govan had set a self-imposed target of having $600 million pledged by the end of 2018, those numbers were worrisome. He was $40 million short. A year later, he more or less still is -- at the very least.
All three people who cited the larger $750 million cost were unauthorized to speak publicly, and all requested anonymity. None could say whether that big jump in the expected expense came before or after the April 9 vote of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which released $117.5 million in taxpayer funds for the project.
Either way, LACMA has not publicly announced an increased target. (In response to an inquiry from The Times, a museum spokesperson said the projected cost for the building remains $650 million.) If the new figure is correct -- and one of the three people indicated that there had been some discussion about raising it considerably higher -- the museum has at least $170 million to go.
What's going on? Why has fundraising stalled?
The problem is not that money is scarce. At minimum, LACMA can claim 16 billionaires on its board of trustees. Sixteen.
For years, charitable giving by individual Americans has represented a modest 2% of total disposable income, according to surveys by Giving USA, an annual report on philanthropy compiled at the University of Indiana. The nonpartisan Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation also estimates that, thanks to the 2017 Trump tax cuts, wealthy families earning between $200,000 and $1 million saw their tax bills drop an average of 9% in each of the last two years.
Just the money the board's billionaires saved would likely cover most of their museum's fundraising gap. LACMA trustees have put up close to half of the pledged funds, and there's no reason to think they lack the financial wherewithal to put the campaign over the top.
But they haven't done it.
The clock keeps ticking. The months -- and now years -- go by. The building project keeps getting pushed back, today standing at well over a year behind schedule, even as the museum's collection galleries were shuttered on Tuesday, the art packed up in crates.
The example usually brought up when sluggish cultural philanthropy in Los Angeles is claimed is the famous near-miss in building Walt Disney Concert Hall. Funding did indeed stall, but once revived, the building project went on to witness unparalleled triumph.
Disney Hall's fundraising woes happened between 1994 and 1996 -- which, if you haven't noticed, was a generation ago. The "sluggish L.A. philanthropy" explanation is so 20th century. Here in the 21st, a different era has emerged.
The best example of just how much it has changed is, ironically enough, LACMA. The existing total pledge of $560 million for a new building is larger than any cultural fundraising tally I could name in the city's history.
So the reason for today's stall lies elsewhere. Almost three years ago, Govan himself put his finger on the more current governing dynamic in an interview with the New York Times.
"I can't say it strongly enough: It's not a question of whether there's money in L.A for such a project: There is," Govan said. "The question is, will people decide that's what they want to do with it."
He's right. There is enough money. And not enough people who have enough money have decided they want to make Govan's vision a reality.
I don't blame them. Well-placed concern has grown over the uninspiring building and what it means for both the museum and L.A., starting with lost possibilities for future expansion at the site. Not only will the expensive new structure offer less gallery space than the old buildings it will replace, but the museum's important collections will no longer be permanently installed.
The New Republic aptly dissed the costly, ill-defined scheme for future satellite facilities around the county as "little more than a convenient excuse for real estate investors to kick-start the all-too-familiar gentrification process." Meanwhile, to make a half-baked idea for a ceaseless diet of changing theme exhibitions a reality, the budget has apparently ballooned.
The list of issues is long. In short, the plan radically transforms LACMA's mission in dubious but irreversible ways that have become clear only in the last two years.
No wonder anxieties have been sent skyward. The plan is shortsighted, not visionary as claimed. When fingers are shaking, wallets just don't readily open.

Texto completo: A settlement under New York City's new prohibition against hairstyle discrimination requires a Manhattan salon to take steps to combat such behavior.
A luxury Upper East Side hair salon accused of telling black workers that Afros and box braids did not fit the area's upscale image will train employees to work with black hair and help advance the careers of stylists who are not white, city officials said Tuesday.
The salon, Sharon Dorram Color at Sally Hershberger, agreed to the measures as part of a settlement with New York City's Human Rights Commission that grew out of an investigation prompted by former employees' complaints about hair-based racial bias.
The settlement, which also calls for the salon to pay a $ 70,000 fine, was the first to be reached since the commission's February release of legal guidelines recognizing discrimination on the basis of hairstyle as racial discrimination.
"This resolution is another step toward ensuring that racist notions of professional appearance standards are not applied in New York City," Carmelyn P. Malalis, the commission's chairwoman, said in a statement.
The settlement calls for the salon to team up with a New York City styling school with expertise in the care and styling of black hair for two purposes: to instruct and inform current employees and to start an internship program specifically for stylists from underrepresented groups.
In addition, the commission said, Sharon Dorram, a colorist, and Tim Lehman, a senior stylist, must complete 35 hours of community service with a racial justice group "that works to combat hair discrimination and promote black beauty."
Ms. Hershberger said in a statement that she "had no involvement in the allegations" at issue in the settlement; was "100 percent against racial discrimination"; and favored "a diverse work environment full of authenticity, integrity and individuality."
She added: "I am taking all measures to ensure that my views are fully reflected at all of my salons."
Ms. Dorram said through a spokeswoman that she "was extremely sorry that her actions have caused any person to feel uncomfortable in her salon." She added that her policy now was that all employees were "free to wear their hair in any way that they choose and may freely express their unique styles."
Mr. Lehman could not be reached for comment. Steve Tuttleman, whom the commission identified as an owner of the salon with Ms. Hershberger and Ms. Dorram, did not respond to a request for comment.
The salon, which occupies the top two floors of a townhouse on East 71st Street, is a favorite of celebrities like Meg Ryan and Kate Hudson. Ms. Hershberger is known for her $ 1,000 haircuts and "24K" hair products in gold-trimmed black packaging. Her clients have included Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. Ms. Dorram has worked for Christie Brinkley and Renée Zellweger.
Ms. Hershberger also operates salons in New York at Barneys on Madison Avenue, on West 26th Street and at the Hudson Yards complex, and in West Hollywood, Calif. The settlement reached with the commission applies to all of Ms. Hershberger's New York outlets.
Ms. Hershberger's Upper East Side salon was among several businesses to be investigated by the commission after employees complained about being discriminated against because of their hair. The investigations led the commission to adopt the new guidelines. A commission spokeswoman said that several businesses remain under investigation.
In the case of the salon, four former workers filed complaints from 2016 to 2018. The first was from a former general manager who was white and said he was sickened by having to enforce a dress code and hair policy that was applied more strictly to black workers than white ones.
Interviewed for an earlier New York Times article, the former manager, David Speer, said that Ms. Dorram pushed for the dress code only after he hired three black women -- Taren Guy, Raelene Roberts and Regine Aubourg -- as receptionists.
In a text message written by Ms. Dorram, one of several Mr. Speer shared with The Times, she criticized the receptionists' appearance.
"Today looked awful," she wrote, saying that Ms. Roberts "had her dreads down" and that Ms. Aubourg "just got hers to match as long." Ms. Dorram added: "All 3 at desk and we look like we should be on E. 134th Street." (Ms. Dorram said in February that the hair policy was not racially motivated and that her text messages had been mischaracterized.)
Believed to be the first of their kind in the United States, the city's guidelines prohibit the targeting of people based on their hairstyle at work and school and in public places. They specifically cite the right to maintain "natural hair, treated or untreated hairstyles such as locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, fades, Afros, and/or the right to keep hair in an uncut or untrimmed state."
Since New York City introduced the rules, New York State, New Jersey, California and Montgomery County, Md., have adopted similar measures.
There is no legal precedent in federal court for protection against hair-based racial discrimination. In 2018, the Supreme Court declined to consider a case brought by a black woman who had a job offer from an insurance company rescinded after she would not cut off her dreadlocks.
Last month, a Queens woman invoked the city and state guidelines in a lawsuit brought against Immaculate Conception Catholic Academy of Jamaica, Queens.
In the suit, filed in State Supreme Court in Queens, the woman, Lavona Batts, accused the school of discriminating against her son, who is black and was starting his first year there, by saying he could not wear his hair in braids.
The boy, a third grader, was "very proud of his hair," Ms. Batts said in the suit. "He considers his hair to be an important part of his identity and he has no intentions of changing his hairstyle."

Texto completo: Ever since my book, "The Life and Afterlife of Harry Houdini," came out, people have asked if I have tried any impossible escapes of my own. I'm going to try one here. I'm going to try and write about President Donald Trump without invoking politics. Wish me luck.
It is stunning how many people have read the book a story about the great escape artist and how he still impacts the world and immediately thought of Trump.
He is not referenced in the book. But he is there, because the similarities between Houdini and Trump are, pardon the word, inescapable.
Houdini was the greatest showman of his time or, perhaps, any time. He was a master at using the media to promote himself.
He was a prolific mythmaker or liar, if you prefer. Nothing about Houdini was as it seemed. He relished every challenge that came his way including allowing the punch to the stomach that led to his death.
He ruthlessly attacked his enemies and his perceived enemies. He would sometimes go to shows of his imitators while dressed as an old man. He would then take the stage, lock up the imposters in unbreakable handcuffs, tear off his costume and shout, "I am Houdini!"
Houdini once sued a German newspaper and police officer who charged him with perpetrating a fraud on German audiences. He won in court and told the story repeatedly for the rest of his life.
Does any of this sound familiar?
Understand, Houdini began as a struggling and conventional magician in 1898, he put up all of his secrets for sale when he made an astonishing discovery: People, everywhere, love the seemingly impossible escape.
And so he began escaping from handcuffs and chains and jails and straitjackets and milk cans and water torture cells and boxes and bags and anything else "Nothing on earth can hold Houdini a prisoner," he insisted. And in that time long before radio, much less Instagram, he went viral again and again.
And our fascination with escape goes on, it is timeless. This is why Houdini is constantly referenced today. Every time a quarterback escapes a sack, a dog escapes a yard, a friend escapes paying the bill or an inmate escapes a jail cell, they are the next Houdini.
Trump has been called Houdini many times in his life by his biggest fans and his fiercest critics. It's undeniable: He's the escape artist of our time.
He repeatedly escapes from situations that would have stopped even the savviest of politicians and business leaders. And he does it much in the same way that Houdini did: With audacity and shamelessness and limitless refusal to accept defeat and a supernatural belief in his own powers.
When Trump, as reports say, added a Sharpie mark to a weather map to prove that Alabama was indeed in the line of a hurricane, it was like Houdini had come back to life. That's exactly what he would have done.
One of my favorite stories in the book is about the time a man named William Hope Hodgson intended to defeat Houdini. He challenged Houdini to escape from his personal handcuffs and Hodgson proceeded to put multiple handcuffs and chains around Houdini until, as one reporter said, he looked like "a trussed turkey."
Houdini complained repeatedly that this wasn't a fair fight, that Hodgson had almost broken his arm, that he had lost all feeling in his limbs and asked to have the chains removed for a moment.
"This is a contest, not a love match," Hodgson shouted as the crowd booed.
Hodgson was sure he had Houdini beaten. There were no tricks left, no misdirections to pull, no secrets to hide. Houdini was entirely up and he couldn't get out and that was that.
Only Houdini got out. And then he stood before the audience, his arms were bloodied and his face was white from exhaustion, and in his own words, "I suffered the tortures of hell. I sweat blood!" But he escaped because he always escaped and that isn't just Houdini's story.

Envoy's July call to Trump from Kyiv restaurant seen as stunning breach

Texto completo: Officials say Russians probably listened in on Sondland conversation
A U.S. ambassador's cellphone call to President Trump from a restaurant in the capital of Ukraine this summer was a stunning breach of security, exposing the conversation to surveillance by foreign intelligence services, including Russia's, former U.S. officials said.
The call " in which Trump's remarks were overheard by a U.S. Embassy staffer in Kyiv " was disclosed Wednesday by the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, William B. Taylor Jr., on the dramatic opening day of public impeachment hearings into alleged abuse of power by the president.
'The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone' asking U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland about 'the investigations,' Taylor testified, referring to the president's desire for a probe of the son of Trump's potential political opponent in 2020, Joe Biden, and the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden once served.
Sondland, Taylor said, told Trump in that conversation that 'the Ukrainians were ready to move forward' on the investigations.
The U.S. Embassy staffer who overheard the call, political counselor David Holmes, is scheduled to testify Friday before House impeachment investigators in a closed session.
'The security ramifications are insane " using an open cellphone to communicate with the president of the United States,' said Larry Pfeiffer, a former senior director of the White House Situation Room and a former chief of staff to the CIA director. 'In a country that is so wired with Russian intelligence, you can almost take it to the bank that the Russians were listening in on the call.'
The impromptu Sondland-Trump conversation took place a day after an official call July-25 between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump had pressed for investigations. Zelensky at that time was eager to secure a White House visit. The Trump-Zelensky call and the pressure on the authorities in Kyiv to conduct investigations that could aid Trump's 2020 campaign are at the heart of the impeachment hearings.
It was also noteworthy in that ambassadors typically don't just pick up the phone and call presidents. 'They never do so to discuss Ukraine policy,' former U.S. ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said in a tweet. 'Doing so on a cellphone from Kyiv means [the] whole world was listening in.'
Russia already has shown its ability to monitor U.S. diplomats' calls in Kyiv, and the Kremlin has no hesi ta tion in leaking them when it suits its interests. In early 2014, an intercepted phone conversation between then-Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland and then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt appeared on YouTube. On the call, Nuland was heard referring dismissively to slow-moving European Union efforts to address a looming political and economic crisis in Ukraine. 'F--- the E.U.,'' she said.
She also was heard assessing the political skills of Ukrainian opposition figures with unusual candor. The leaked call was embarrassing to Washington and appeared to be an effort by Moscow to drive a wedge between the United States and the European Union. The State Department acknowledged the call was authentic, and Nuland apologized to E.U. officials. But U.S. officials also were quick to blame Russia for the leak, describing it as a form of information warfare.
Calling a president from a cellphone violates protocols set up to protect senior administration officials' communications. 'It's indicative of a lack of concern for operational security,' said a former senior U.S. intelligence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being accused of making statements motivated by political bias. Senior officials, he said, 'are routinely briefed on the threats to their communications. You could assume that talking on an unencrypted line from a foreign country would be on that list.'
It is also dangerous for a president to take an off-the-books call like that, Pfeiffer said. That is why call logs are kept, he said. Without them, someone could assert that the president said something on a call, and a log 'protects the president's ability to deny something happened,' he said. 'Good bureaucratic record-keeping is a protection for someone in the position of the president.'
This is not the first time questions have arisen over Trump's un or tho dox phone use. He has been known to give his personal cellphone number to other world leaders, despite aides' warnings that his cellphone calls are not secure. Russia and China in particular have targeted his personal cellphone calls, the New York Times reported.
In general, Trump has appeared unusually cavalier about operational security. In February 2017, at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, on an open terrace in full view of other diners, Trump and Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had a sensitive discussion about how to respond to a ballistic missile test by North Korea.

FBI: Hate crimes in N.M. up fourfold

Texto completo: At least three incidents of anti-Semitism in May raised alarms in Santa Fe of rising prejudice: A vandal defaced a Railyard Park plaque honoring a family of German Jewish community leaders in the 1800s by scrawling the word "Jews" in white paint; the words "Jew Fro" were painted on a bike trail sign; a purple swastika and the words "Trump 2020" appeared on playground equipment at a park in Eldorado.
Newly released data from the FBI shows that while such hate-related crimes began to dip across the U.S. last year following a three-year increase, the number of hate crimes reported in New Mexico quadrupled between 2017 and 2018 -- jumping to 28 from seven.
The anti-Semitic graffiti in Santa Fe this year indicates the trend is continuing.
"We can definitely identify that there is a trend," said Scott Levin, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League.
The increase in such incidents in New Mexico is especially worrisome, Levin said, given that many bias-motivated crimes go unreported.
More than 16,000 law enforcement agencies voluntarily reported hate crime statistics to the FBI last year, according to the annual Hate Crime Statistics report, released Tuesday. Agencies participating in the data-collection effort reported a total of 7,120 crimes; 87 percent of those agencies, however, said they didn't have a single crime to report.
Levin said he found that "pretty hard to believe." Mandating data collection and offering training to law enforcement would be critical steps to developing effective approaches to combating the problem, he added.
"I'm one of those who believes you can't manage what you don't measure," Levin said. "We can't really deal with [hate crimes] if we aren't measuring" them.
Greg Gurulé, a spokesman for the Santa Fe Police Department, said local officers check a box on a report when they consider a violent act to be a hate crime.
"I can tell you just by looking at reports that come in every day that I don't see anything like that," he said, adding most of the city's day-to-day crimes are against "people who know each other."
Levin argued, however, that many hate crimes are not violent acts but graffiti or harassment intended to send threatening messages -- such as a swastika painted on a children's playground toy.
"Hate crimes really are message crimes," Levin said. "It's not necessarily doing it against you because they're mad at you as an individual, but it's sending a message to anyone that looks like you, prays like you or loves like you ... of hate."
According to the New York Times, the FBI's national data shows a decline in hate-related property crimes, while violent attacks increased, with victims from a wide range of ethnic and religious backgrounds.
"The trends show more violence, more interpersonal violence, and I think that's probably reliable," James Nolan, a former FBI crime analyst, told the Times.
Crimes targeting people in LGBTQ communities also increased in 2018, with a 42 percent increase in crimes against transgender people, according to the national FBI report.
The majority of reported hate crimes in 2018 were race-based, according to the data, and 50 percent targeted African Americans.
Anti-Hispanic hate crimes in the U.S. increased for the third consecutive year.
According to the Times, hate crimes against Latinos were at their highest level since 2010. Some advocates placed blame on President Donald Trump.
"There's a direct correlation between the hate speech and fearmongering coming from President Trump and the right wing of the Republican Party with the increase in attacks against Latinos," Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens, told the Times.
Garcia predicted the rise in hate crimes will not stop until the hateful rhetoric against Latinos has ended.
In New Mexico, a state with a large Hispanic population, the rise in hate crimes nationally "sends a message that they're not welcome," Levin said. "It's really important that the government and community send a countermessage."
During a summit at the state Capitol in August, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and several key lawmakers did just that, announcing plans to pursue several initiatives aimed at preventing hate crimes. The proposals, which included increased penalties and additional gun safety legislation, followed a mass shooting in El Paso that killed 22 people and is suspected as a racially motivated attack against Latinos.
Tuesday's FBI report followed the one-year anniversary of another hate-related mass shooting: an attack on Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue, where 11 Jews were killed.
While religion-based hate crimes in the U.S. decreased overall by
8 percent in 2018, nearly 60 percent of religiously affiliated crimes last year targeted Jews and Jewish institutions, the FBI report shows. Levin, who is Jewish, said the fact that this type of "bigotry is still going on is extremely troubling."
"It's important for everyone to call out hate, so that everyone in this country -- no matter what their race, religion, sexual orientation or other immutable characteristic -- can feel as welcome as everyone else," Levin said. "Hate has no place here."

Texto completo: Pues esa será la cifra de precandidatos presidenciales demócratas si el exgobernador de Massachusetts Deval Patrick se suma a la carrera por la Casa Blanca antes del fin de semana, como informó el miércoles la prensa estadounidense.
Patrick, de 63 años, uno de los primeros gobernadores afroamericanos de Estados Unidos y cercano al expresidente Barack Obama , no confirmó haber comunicado estos planes a varios políticos demócratas, como indicaron varios medios.
Pero según el New York Times y la televisión CNN, este sexagenario relativamente moderado podría confirmar su decisión por video desde este jueves, e inscribirse como candidato a las primarias demócratas en New Hampshire el viernes, día de cierre de las inscripciones en ese estado.
Si se confirma, la candidatura tardía de Patrick demostrará las angustias en el campo demócrata: muchos se inquietan de ver que los senadores Bernie Sanders y Elizabeth Warren, muy de izquierda, suben en los sondeos y superan al centrista Joe Biden , lo cual según ellos arruina las posibilidades de que los demócratas expulsen a Trump de la Casa Blanca en las presidenciales de noviembre de 2020.
Testigo de estas preocupaciones, el multimillonario y exalcalde de Nueva York Michael Bloomberg también contempla disputar las primarias demócratas.
Casado con una abogada y padre de dos hijas, Deval Patrick descartó no obstante en diciembre de 2018 la idea de presentarse a las presidenciales, citando “la crueldad del proceso electoral que terminaría por perjudicar a personas que Diane (su esposa) y yo amamos”.
Pero a menos de tres meses de las primarias, Patrick estima ahora que aún hay lugar para un candidato capaz de unir a demócratas moderados y radicales, según sus allegados.
Nacido en una familia pobre de Chicago, luego becario de una escuela de élite de Boston antes de graduarse en derecho en Harvard, Patrick fue abogado durante mucho tiempo, sobre todo para la asociación de defensa de los derechos de los afroamericanos NAACP, antes de convertirse en gobernador de Massachusetts de 2007 a 2014.
Desde que dejó la gobernación trabaja para el fondo de inversiones privado Bain Capital, que se especializa en empresas que impulsan un modelo de desarrollo sustentable, y como comentarista político del canal CBS News.
Fue así que comentó el último debate demócrata, donde subrayó que “ser candidato, como ser un funcionario electo, es una mezcla de sustancia y de desempeño artístico”.
La disputa por la investidura demócrata ya cuenta con otros dos candidatos afroamericanos, la senadora de California Kamala Harris y el senador de Nueva Jersey Cory Booker. Pero ninguno lidera por ahora la carrera.

Twitter 'bots' targeted Ky. on election night

Texto completo: As the final votes trickled in during last week's Kentucky gubernatorial election, a network of automated Twitter accounts suddenly sprang into action. They spread misinformation about the election being rigged, according to the CEO of a company that tracks political misinformation on social media.
Gideon Blocq, the founder and CEO of VineSight, told the Courier Journal his company witnessed thousands of accounts with "bot-like" automated behavior spreading misinformation about the race, including a screenshot of a tweet by one account claiming to have destroyed ballots with votes for incumbent Republican Gov. Matt Bevin.
"Immediately at the end of the counting of the votes, these stories started popping up in parallel, all about the election being rigged," Block said.
One of the tweets spreading the furthest came from user @Overlordkraken1, which tweeted at 8:39 p.m. he had "just shredded a box of Republican mail in ballots," adding "Bye bye Bevin." The tweet listed the user's location as Louisville, though it misspelled the word.
Bevin would end up losing to Democrat Andy Beshear by 5,189 votes, though the governor told supporters at 10 p.m. election night that he would not concede the race, citing unspecified voting "irregularities."
The next day, Bevin requested an official recanvass of the vote, alleging widespread fraud and "thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted." In a Courier Journal fact check of Bevin's claims, local elections officials refer to the allegations as "ridiculous" and "flatly not true."
The governor has not provided any proof for such claims, and spokespersons for his office and campaign have not responded to questions asking if this tweet plays into his allegations.
After being retweeted at least 91 times, the account was suspended – though Blocq said a screenshot of the tweet was then posted election night and "we saw huge bot networks just pushing it around."
While the suspended account was likely a real person just "trolling" with the shredding tweet, Blocq said "thousands" of bot accounts spread the screenshot in parallel with other tweets alleging that the election was rigged, showing "this is not a small operation ... it is not just one person doing this."
By early the next day, someone created a meme suggesting thousands of votes for Bevin were not counted because every other Republican candidate on the ballot did so well. That also spread rapidly among social media. For example, one Twitter account with more than 117,000 followers tweeted the meme along with the word "rigged!" which was retweeted more than 1,000 times over the next day, mostly by bot accounts.
Blocq said bytwo days after the election, a simple search for the Kentucky election on Twitter would turn up tweets including the screenshot, meme and other claims about the election being rigged in its top results.
While the influence of Kremlin-backed groups to spread misinformation in the 2016 presidential campaign is well documented, Blocq said he could not determine the origin of the bot network pushing tweets about the Kentucky race, as he can only see publicly available data. However, he said that those working at Twitter would have more answers about the location of the bots.
Twitter told The New York Times this weekend that the spread of misinformation regarding the Kentucky race for governor largely appeared to originate in the United States.
The Department of Homeland Security tracks foreign interference in U.S. elections that exploits divisions through the spread of misinformation on social networks.
Bevin's requested recanvass will take place Thursday, with voting officials in each county checking to make sure they transmitted the correct numbers to the secretary of state.
Republican state legislators have expressed skepticism that the recanvass will significantly change the official vote totals and warned against Bevin creating a "fishing expedition" by contesting the election in the legislature if that is the case.
Some legislators have also urged the governor to present evidence of fraud or voting irregularities.
"Any attempt by Gov. Bevin to undermine these results in the legislature is wrong and should be viewed as a direct attack on the democratic process," state Sen. Morgan McGarvey, D-Louisville, said. "Once the recanvass is complete, the General Assembly must accept the outcome of this election and help Gov.-elect Beshear prepare for the 2020 budget."

Tough road to wild card

Texto completo: There was good news and bad news for the Philadelphia Eagles (5-4) and their playoff chances as they enjoyed some much-needed time off this past weekend.
The good: They moved back into a tie with the Dallas Cowboys (5-4) for the NFC East lead and regained control of their playoff destiny because they have one game remaining with Dallas.
The bad: The reason for the Cowboys' falling back into a tie with the Eagles was a loss on Sunday night to the Minnesota Vikings (7-3), who are one of the NFC's top wild-card contenders and whose victory over the Eagles last month means they own the first tiebreaker if it comes down to those two teams for the conference's final playoff spot.
More bad: Seattle (8-2) toppled previously unbeaten San Francisco (8-1) on Monday night, solidifying the Seahawks as the other non-division leader whose record is better than the Eagles' heading into Week 11.
What it all means is that the Eagles' best path to the postseason remains as division winners, although they have a chance to damage Seattle's chances when they host the Seahawks on Nov. 24.
The game against Seattle has been flexed from an 8:20 p.m. start on NBC to a 1 p.m. start on FOX. NBC will instead get to broadcast a meeting of first-place teams when the 49ers host the Green Bay Packers.
The Los Angeles Rams and the Carolina Panthers also have 5-4 records, putting them in that second tier of wild-card contenders with the Eagles.
According to The New York Times, the Eagles have a 53% chance to make the playoffs.
Morning Call reporter Nick Fierro can be reached at 610-778-2243 or nfierro@mcall.com.

N.F.L. Says It Will Give Kaepernick A Workout

Texto completo: The quarterback who knelt to protest racial injustice has not played in an N.F.L. game since the 2016 season. He once led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl.
Colin Kaepernick, the quarterback who for nearly three years has struggled to resume his N.F.L. career after kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice, has been invited to work out for teams on Saturday at the Atlanta Falcons' facility so they can evaluate whether to sign him, according to a copy of a memo to the league's 32 teams that was reviewed by The New York Times.
"Earlier this year, we discussed some possible steps with his representatives, and they recently emphasized his level of preparation and that he is ready to work out for clubs and be interviewed by them," the memo said. "We have therefore arranged this opportunity for him to work out, and for all clubs to have the opportunity to evaluate his current readiness and level of interest in resuming his N.F.L. career."
Kaepernick, 32, and his representatives were notified Tuesday of the league's invitation and were told they had two hours to confirm that he would attend the workout in Flowery Branch, Ga., according to a person familiar with the discussion who requested anonymity. The person said that the representatives were confused about why the workout was slated for a Saturday, when teams travel to away games, and that they had asked for it be moved to a Tuesday, when teams usually hold their workouts, but that request was denied by the league.
The invitation was first reported by ESPN.
Kaepernick's representatives have requested a list of N.F.L. teams planning to attend, and if they are satisfied with the number, he will work out on the field and do interviews, the person familiar with the discussion said. The memo said that the workout and any interviews would be recorded and the video made available to every team.
On Tuesday evening, Kaepernick tweeted: "I'm just getting word from my representatives that the NFL league office reached out to them about a workout in Atlanta on Saturday. I've been in shape and ready for this for 3 years, can't wait to see the head coaches and GMs on Saturday."
In February, Kaepernick settled a grievance against the league that accused teams of colluding to keep him out of the N.F.L. because of his protests during the 2016 season. He has not played since starting 11 games for the San Francisco 49ers that season, when the team finished 2-14.
Since then, Kaepernick and those around him have continued to lobby for a job in the N.F.L. A month before the start of the regular season, Kaepernick posted a video to social media touting his preparation for a return to the field. "5am. 5 days a week. For 3 years. Still Ready," he said on Twitter.
His agent, Jeff Nalley, issued a news release in October stating that Kaepernick had visited Seattle in the spring of 2017 as the Seahawks searched for a backup to Russell Wilson, but that no other team had worked him out or interviewed him. Nalley did not respond to a voice mail message left on his cellphone or to a text message.
For Kaepernick, this weekend could represent his best, and perhaps last, opportunity to play again. N.F.L. teams regularly hold workouts for free agents, cycling them through their facilities as they churn the bottom of their rosters. Teams also hopscotch the country in the spring to assess college prospects before the N.F.L. draft. But none have brought in Kaepernick over the last two seasons, and it is rare for the league, outside of its scouting combine, to hold a workout and invite all 32 teams.
Kaepernick first barged into the national consciousness because of his football skills, showcasing his passing acumen, arm strength and elusiveness after replacing an injured Alex Smith as the 49ers' starter in 2012 and leading the team to the Super Bowl, which it lost to the Baltimore Ravens. The following season, Kaepernick helped the 49ers reach the N.F.C. championship game.
But by 2016, despite throwing for 16 touchdowns and four interceptions while averaging 6.8 yards per rushing attempt, he had become better known as one of the more polarizing athletes -- if not public figures -- in the country.
While Kaepernick has not been on the field, he has loomed large over the league. Since his departure, several players have emulated his protest during the anthem. Some continue to cite him as an inspiration, and musicians have said they will not perform at the Super Bowl because they believe the league has effectively blackballed Kaepernick.
When protests during the anthem consumed the league early in the 2017 season, President Trump said players who do not stand for the song should be fired. In August, Trump told reporters that he thought Kaepernick should be hired "if he's good enough."
Kaepernick's scheduled workout comes during a particularly trying year for quarterbacks in the N.F.L., as a slew of injuries has pushed backups into starting roles and magnified the dearth of candidates at the sport's most glamorous position. Andrew Luck of the Indianapolis Colts abruptly retired before the start of the season because of injuries, and stars like Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers and Drew Brees of the New Orleans Saints have missed significant time.
None of them has missed more time than Kaepernick, and this weekend he may move closer to the N.F.L. than he has been in a long while.

Texto completo: Un joven de Tailandia, adicto a los videojuegos fue hallado muerto luego de jugar durante varios días. El chico, identificado como Piyawat Harikun de 17 años, jugó sin descanso; lo encontró su familia frente a la pantalla.
De acuerdo al diario The New York Times, Jaranwit Piyawat , padre del joven, declaró que cuando entró a su habitación lo llamó por su nombre; sin embargo, al no obtener respuesta, descubrió que estaba muerto. “Lo llamé por su nombre y le dije: ‘Despierta, despierta’, pero él no respondió. Pude ver que estaba muerto”, confesó Piyawat, quien es oficial de la fuerza aérea.
El padre declaró que trató de advertir a su hijo sobre los riesgos de las largas horas de juego, pero “ya era demasiado tarde”. Jaranwit relató que trató de revivir a su hijo, pero no tuvo éxito. Por su parte, los médicos examinaron el cuerpo del muchacho y determinaron que falleció por un derrame cerebral provocado por las largas horas delante de la pantalla.
“Traté de advertirle sobre sus implacables largas horas jugando y prometió reducirlo, pero ya era demasiado tarde. Ya había muerto antes de tener la oportunidad de cambiar”, señaló Piyawat. Además, dijo que espera que la muerte de su hijo sea un llamado de atención para otros adictos al juego.
“Mi hijo era inteligente y siempre fue excelente en la escuela, pero tenía un gran problema con la adicción a los juegos. Deben ser más estrictos con las horas de juego de sus hijos, de lo contrario podrían terminar como mi hijo”, finalizó el desconsolado padre de familia. La Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS) catalogó la adicción a los juegos de video como trastorno mental. Y el Servicio Nacional de Salud de Reino Unido (NHS), fundó la primera clínica para combatir este problema en chicos de 13 a 25 años y ofrece terapias presenciales o en línea.

The anonymous official who has written a scathing account of the presidency of Donald Trump suggests the president might refuse to leave office even if convicted in impeachment hearings or defeated narrowly in the 2020 election – and says Trump is preparing his followers to see either outcome as a “coup” that could warrant resistance.
“He will not exit quietly – or easily,” the author, self-described as a senior administration official, writes in A Warning, a book that builds on an explosive op-ed by the same unnamed author last year. USA TODAY obtained an early copy of the book.
“It is why at many turns he suggests ‘coups’ are afoot and a ‘civil war’ is in the offing. He is already seeding the narrative for his followers – a narrative that could end tragically. ”
From 'Anonymous': Read key excerpts from inside Trump White House on Putin, Pence, Hillary
As the House of Representatives prepares to open public impeachment hearings Wednesday, the book also says that Trump ordered aides more than a year ago to pursue a “deliberate and coordinated campaign” to obstruct an impeachment inquiry and other congressional investigations. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff has said he is considering obstruction of Congress as a possible Article of Impeachment.
The book's author is identified only as “a senior official in the Trump administration,” and its forthcoming publication has created a firestorm over both its depiction of a dysfunctional president and the decision by the writer to remain anonymous.
"The coward who wrote this book didn't put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said.
Many of the disclosures echo news stories that have portrayed the president as impulsive, sometimes uninformed and regularly willing to defy established norms. There is already no shortage of books by Trump critics, including former FBI director James Comey and others who have served in his administration, that raise questions about the president's fitness for office.
But The New York Times op-ed in 2018 and the new book, being published next Tuesday by Twelve, have commanded enormous attention because the author had an inside view, often participating in small White House meetings where crucial decisions were made.
The author portrays himself or herself as sharing some policy views with Trump and initially having a positive if wary view of the possibilities of his presidency.
The author says the intended audience for A Warning isn’t those who closely follow politics but rather those who don't, particularly voters from across the country who were drawn in 2016 to Trump's promise to shake up the establishment.
Dropping Pence from the ticket?
The book says that Trump "on more than one occasion" discussed with staffers the possibility of dropping Vice President Mike Pence before the 2020 election.
"Former UN ambassador Nikki Haley was under active consideration to step in as vice president, which she did not discourage at first," the author writes, saying some advisers argued that putting Haley on the ticket would help the president bolster his support among female voters.
In an interview Friday with USA TODAY, Nikki Haley dismissed out of hand the suggestion that she might replace Pence. In her new book, With All Due Respect, Haley offers a generally positive portrait of Trump, and the president rewarded her with a friendly tweet urging his millions of followers to buy a copy.
Pathway of impeachment: How it works, where we are
"Anonymous" depicts Trump as impatient, immoral, cruel, even dangerous as he rejects the limits placed on presidents by Congress and the courts.
As the 2018 midterm elections approached, the book says, the White House counsel’s office began to develop a “contingency plan” to shield the administration if Democrats gained control of Congress, and with that the ability to launch investigations and issue subpoenas. New lawyers were hired and internal procedures revamped, the author writes.
“The goal wasn’t just to prepare for a barrage of legislative requests,” the book says. “It was a concerted attempt to fend off congressional oversight. When Democrats finally took the House, the unspoken administration policy toward Capitol Hill became: Give as little as possible, wait as long as possible. Even routine inquiries are now routed to the lawyers, who have found unique ways to say “We can’t right now,” “Give us a few months,” “We’re going to need to put you on hold,” “Probably not,” “No,” and “Not a chance in hell. ”
Trump impeachment inquiry: Early findings and how Republicans are opposing them
The author says the administration's refusal to comply with congressional requests and even subpoenas "go beyond standard practice and have turned into a full block-and-tackle exercise against congressional investigators across an array of Trump administration controversies. "
On the president's actions with Ukraine, now the heart of the impeachment inquiry, the author writes that the idea Trump was trying to battle corruption abroad – rather than gain some partisan political advantage at home – was "barely believable to anyone around him. "
But the book provides no significant new information or insights into that episode.
'Get Out of Jail Free' cards
The author's agent, Matt Latimer, said the author didn't take an advance payment for the book and plans to donate a substantial amount of the royalties to nonprofit organizations that encourage government accountability and an independent press.
Among other allegations, the book says:
Several top advisers and Cabinet-level officials last year discussed a mass resignation, "a midnight self-massacre," intended to call attention to what they saw as Trump's questionable and even corrupt behavior. "The idea was abandoned out of fear that it would make a bad situation worse. "
If a majority of the Cabinet called for Trump's removal under the rules of the 25th Amendment, Pence would have been willing to go along with them. But the author provides no evidence to back up that assertion, and Pence in recent days has strongly denied it.
Trump told officials that, if they took illegal actions on his behalf, he would give them presidential pardons. "To Donald Trump, these are unlimited 'Get Out of Jail Free' cards on a Monopoly board. "
Trump was "particularly frustrated that the Justice Department hasn't done more to harass the Clintons. " The president suggested to his first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, that he might "un-recuse" himself from the Mueller inquiry into Russian election interference, presumably so he would feel free to order a more aggressive inquiry into Trump's 2016 opponent. "You'd be a hero," the president told him.

Texto completo: Nov. 13, 1946 : An airplane flew over Mount Greylock (above, as seen from Adams) in Western Massachusetts and seeded the clouds with super-cooled ice crystals. The first-ever artificially produced snow melted before it hit the slopes below, but the event created a national sensation.
The experiment marked the first field test of scientist Vincent Schaefer's laboratory experiments in which he produced precipitation by adding dry ice to lower the temperature of a chilled chamber.
Schaefer, a self-taught chemist who worked for General Electric, seeded the clouds from an altitude of 14,000 feet. Flying over Greylock (at almost 3,500 feet, it is the highest point in the Berkshires), Schaefer dropped his pellets and produced a similar effect in the clouds, which resulted in snow that fell an estimated 3,000 feet before evaporating in the dry air.
“It seemed as though the cloud almost exploded," he wrote in a notebook after the experiment, according to his New York Times obituary in 1983.
Artificial snow, like so many other scientific innovations, was born out of wartime necessity. In this case, it began during World War II and experiments with the creation of artificial fog, which was meant to conceal ships at sea.
Although some people protested that tampering with nature might not be safe or proper, within three years ski resorts across the United States were experimenting with snowmaking.
The snow cannon was invented in 1950. Snow is made by combining water and air, often compressed and pressurized through hoses.
By 1952, the first snowmaking machinery was in regular use at a Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel (one of the largest Borscht Belt resorts), near the village of Liberty, N.Y.
Today, virtually every American ski area produces artificial snow, and snowmaking is a multimillion-dollar global business.
For his part, Schaefer was remembered as “the first person to actually do something about the weather and not just talk about it," according to his obituary. “Hopes grew that cloud seeding could fight drought, control storms, reduce hail, quench forest fires, and even guarantee a white Christmas."

Should you hire a doula?

Texto completo: Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.
When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. Delaware was unranked because data was unavailable; it's unclear how many maternal deaths occur in Delaware every year. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities. "The color of your skin," she said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust. And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood. A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner. They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin, New Jersey. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family. When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America, she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated. "For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor. "Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right. Advocacy can be especially important for women of color. As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women. Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa.
"Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors. Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Expanding access to doulas Under the umbrella of Nurture NJ, the state Department of Health's "Healthy Women, Healthy Families" program has provided funding for partners to hire 77 outreach workers – 40 doulas, 29 community health workers and eight community health worker supervisors – to improve the health of African American women.
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections
and give birth
to healthier babies.

Texto completo: The Democrats have 17 candidates clamoring for their presidential nomination, offering a wide and impressive array of experience and ideas. What makes Michael Bloomberg believe they may need another?
For one thing, he's not the only person who thinks so.
A problem in having so many choices - too many, really - is that people are slow to settle on one. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the one whom Donald Trump fears most, is struggling to raise money befitting a front-runner. He's also losing traction to Elizabeth Warren, whose advocacy of mandatory Medicare for All and a wealth tax worry some who might accept them, but for two more urgent priorities.
Those priorities are defeating Trump and electing a Congress not hostile to moderate and achievable reforms such as Medicare for those who want it - that is, the public option that should have been in the Affordable Care Act all along.
Bloomberg isn't the only Democrat who doubts that Warren or Bernie Sanders could accomplish all that.
This is a nation that welcomes progress, but prefers that it come in measured strides, rather than great leaps forward.
Should Biden falter in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina - the earliest of the caucus and primary states - Bloomberg's plan would be to make a late but bold grab for Super Tuesday March 3, with its huge haul of Texas, California and 12 other states and territories.
But a late-entry strategy has been tried and failed every time, notably by Rudy Giuliani. Bloomberg would be fairly accused of having skipped places he couldn't win.
November 2020 will be a close election, no matter what some polls show, because of the anti-democratic influence of the Electoral College. There will be no votes that the Democrats can afford to waste. The advantages of nominating a centrist would be significant.
Bloomberg is certainly a centrist. He has broad potential appeal to Democrats passionate about gun control and saving the climate, both of which he has supported with enthusiasm and money. His campaign contributions aided the success of Florida's Fair Districts voter initiatives in 2010, and just helped turn Virginia blue.
But Biden, too, is a centrist. So are Amy Klobuchar and some others.
It is Biden's candidacy that stands the most to lose from a Bloomberg campaign, which could hardly help the others. Bloomberg's primary campaign could have the paradoxical consequence of nominating Warren or Sanders and re-electing Trump. Before committing to the race, Bloomberg should think very seriously about that.
There's no doubt that Bloomberg despises Trump and what he has done to and with the presidency.
"I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one," the former mayor told the Democratic National Convention in 2016.
The contrasts between the two billionaires, assuming that Trump actually is one, couldn't be more pronounced. Bloomberg built a hugely successful business without help from a deep-pockets father. American courthouses aren't littered with litigation over a chronic refusal to pay tradespeople what they are owed. He has never resorted to bankruptcy. He is intelligent, educated and well-mannered. He was never fined for looting a charity. And he proved himself in office before seeking the highest office of all, serving three competent terms as the mayor of a city more populous than 38 states.
But to overcome the other accomplished Democratic candidates, there are several large issues he will have to manage.
* His wealth. Democrats don't mind nominating rich people for the presidency, people like Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and John Kerry, for example But Bloomberg, whose fortune has been estimated at $52 billion, would be by far the wealthiest. Voters would and should demand that he release his income tax forms. As mayor, he insisted they would tell competitors too much about his private business.
He also would need to persuade voters that his opposition to Warren is more about electability than about his long-standing ambition to be president or about her proposed wealth tax, which he opposes. He's not the only person by any means who thinks it's unconstitutional, but that's an open question. What's not in question is that the top 1 percent is concentrating its wealth at a rate not seen since the Gilded Age. Bloomberg would need a persuasive answer for that.
* His campaign strategy. Clearly, he could afford to spend a billion dollars on Super Tuesday and not miss the money. But he shouldn't entirely self-finance his campaign. Democrats won't like that. He should appeal for small contributions, like Sanders did so successfully - not for needing the money, but for offering voters some ownership in his campaign. The risk is that it could embarrass him with a low yield. In that event, it would tell him something.
* His liabilities with blacks and Hispanics. They were the people most often stopped and frisked without cause in a police department practice he still defends. A federal judge called it "indirect racial profiling" and his successor revoked it. At its peak in 2011, nearly 700,000 people were searched. Only 10% were white, according to New York Times columnist Charles Blow, and nearly 90% were innocent.
"Bloomberg used the fear factor to keep white New Yorkers in line," Blow wrote in a fiery column Monday, denouncing what he called a "terror campaign against those young black and Hispanic men."
Bloomberg would likely retort that he was trying to prevent gun violence in minority communities, but it would be a hard sell. Crime has been declining in New York, as well as in most other places, without massive apprehensions of innocent civilians.
Bloomberg deserves credit for deciding early not to run as an independent, which he realized would likely result in splitting the anti-Trump vote and re-electing the president. Before committing to running as a Democrat, however, he should satisfy himself that his candidacy would not have the same tragic outcome.

Health Care, Impeachment and Gutsy Women

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton has been touring the country with her daughter, Chelsea, talking about "The Book of Gutsy Women." But she took time to talk with Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook conference about, among other things, health care, impeachment and the 2020 election. The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
I want to talk to you a little bit about health care, because I know it's an issue that you care so much about, and have thought a lot about. Because we seem to be in a very divided world, not just among two different parties, but even within the Democratic Party. "Medicare for all" versus public option -- you look at what Elizabeth Warren presented and you think what?
I think that the debate within the Democratic Party is a very healthy debate to try to figure out how to achieve the goal of covering everybody with quality, affordable health care, O.K.? My view on this, having been working on it for many years now, is that the Affordable Care Act took us to 90 percent of coverage, the highest we'd ever gotten in our country, after many, many efforts, including the one I was involved in, you know, more than 25 years ago.
We have a 10 percent gap to fill, and we have a lot of learning to do about the best way, not only to fill the gap, but then to drive down costs as much as it's possible to do so, without undermining quality advancements. O.K. So I believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have. A public option is something I've been in favor of for a very long time. I don't believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100 percent coverage and deal with costs, and face some tough issues about competitiveness and other kinds of innovation in health care.
And if you look at our major competitors, a lot of them have mixed systems and produce very good outcomes -- like Switzerland, Germany, etc.
O.K., philosophical question for you, maybe personal. When you think about the role that you were trying to get before President Trump got the job and now -- do you think it's now a different job fundamentally, that it's been changed forever?
Wow, that's a really -- that's a really interesting question, Andrew. I hope not. Because what I see is governance by impulse, by personal grievance, a sense of, you know, vengeance, vindication, a disregard for the rule of law, and undermining of our institutions, so I hope not. Because if that becomes the model. ...Now, it is the model, unfortunately, for other leaders right now, you know?
Not just here in the United States, by the way.
That's my point. That's my point. I mean, you have all kinds of wannabes around the world who are cracking down on the press, who are trying to subvert or at the very least avoid institutions, the rule of law, etc. You've got that happening right now. And so I would like us to return to a presidency where we don't have to wake up every day worried about what the president's going to tweet, what's going to happen next.
Throughout this whole conversation we have not raised -- or at least I have not raised -- one word, which is "impeachment." And you know a lot about impeachment.
Oh, yes I do.
So we can talk about that. But what I wanted to understand from you, knowing what you know about the situation with Ukraine and the president, would you say unequivocally that you'd impeach him today?
Based on what I know, yes. And here's why. And as you alluded, I was on the staff as a very young lawyer that investigated President Nixon. So I spent 18-hour days for, you know, seven months collecting evidence, analyzing it, doing the legal analysis, obviously the constitutional analysis. Why did our founders put that in there?
You know, we have elections, so you don't like somebody or you think they're not performing well, you know, you vote them out. But they worried so much about somebody being in power, particularly the presidency, in between elections who would do irreparable damage to the country. And the high crimes and misdemeanors was a way, borrowed from ancient Anglo-Saxon law, to express their concern and to put a mechanism into the Constitution. So I think Nancy Pelosi resisted, you know, the calls that a lot of people had after whatever happened, emoluments this, obstruction of justice that. You know, no.
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
Would you have impeached on those issues?
No. But I wouldn't necessarily exclude them now from articles of impeachment. But the reason why Ukraine broke through is that it was abundantly clear, even to people who were indifferent toward all the other challenges or questions about Trump, that there's got to be something really wrong with a president using the power of the office to intimidate, extort, bribe the president of another country to do his bidding by manufacturing scandalous material about apparently the opponent that he was most worried about.
Let me just ask you this. Case for optimism: You wrote a book called "The Book of Gutsy Women." And I want to understand, if you could, to give us the case for optimism today.
You know, I am fundamentally optimistic, because I think the worm is turning. I think that, you know, people are beginning to wake up and say, you know, "Hey, come on, this is -- you know, this doesn't make sense." We need to get back to our usual political arguments, not what's happening now.
And so my daughter and I wrote a book called "The Book of Gutsy Women" because we wanted to highlight women whose courage, resilience, really inspired us, and women from the past, obviously women of our current time. And some of them faced extraordinary burdens, and challenges and tragedies of all sorts. But they didn't quit; they kept going. And part of that was their gutsiness, but it was imbued with an optimism.
You were on "Good Morning America" recently with Chelsea. And it almost went without comment, so I wanted to ask you about it: You were asked what was your gutsiest personal moment. And you said staying with your husband.
Yes, it was. It was really hard. It was not by any means an easy or foreordained decision. But at the end of it, after a lot of soul-searching, and prayer, and counseling, and talking to my closest friends, thinking about my family, thinking about, you know, how much we loved each other and all we'd been through I decided it was the right thing for me. But I have always said it's not necessarily the right thing for everybody. People have to make their own decision in such a personal moment.

Trump's plot to derail immigrant citizenship

Texto completo: A quiet Friday before the long Veterans Day weekend was apparently as good a time as any for the Trump administration to unveil its latest assault on immigrants: rules changes designed to deter those legally here from acquiring their rightly earned citizenship.
The proposed new rules direct United States Citizenship and Immigrant Services, or USCIS -- the arm of our immigration system that is supposed to service and welcome, not deport or detain -- to significantly raise the fees for the citizenship application. This and a range of other proposed changes to fees will be published for a 30-day comment period starting Nov. 14, half the usual time allotted for public input.
Under the proposal, the cost to naturalize would rise from $725 to $1,170 for a single application, hitting a level that totals about a month's worth of gross income for an immigrant making the federal minimum wage. Recognizing the burden that even the lower fee had posed for low-income immigrants, USCIS has had a fee-waiver (and partial fee-waiver) system in place that was strengthened and extended by the Obama administration.

The new rules would eliminate a reduced-fee option for applications from families with income between 150% and 200% of the poverty level and almost completely eliminate waivers for everyone else.
The official rationale for the reworked fees and waiver system is that USCIS needs to enhance its revenue to cover its costs. The projected need requires a total revenue increase of around 20%, a figure that hardly justifies a more than 60% hike in the cost of naturalization for most applicants.
Moreover, the Trump administration is proposing to direct more than $200 million from USCIS' enhanced earnings to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, money that could be used to promote immigrants taking up citizenship rather than to chase down their less documented counterparts.
What's behind the shifts? In the official filing, the Department of Homeland Security suggests that previous naturalization fees were set below full cost recovery to "promote naturalization and immigrant integration." In arguing for the proposed fees --which would basically yield a profit for USCIS -- DHS publicly frets that it worked, expressing concern about "the significant increase" of citizenship application forms in recent years.
This worry about new Americans clamoring to naturalize runs against a traditional bipartisan consensus that lawful permanent residents should be encouraged to take the next step to full civic engagement. Business leaders have been strongly on board the naturalization bandwagon, particularly given the evidence of economic benefits to the broader society when people become citizens.
A series of studies by USC's Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration showed that previous fee hikes had a significant negative impact on naturalization rates and tended to disproportionately impact lower-income and Latino immigrants.
In particular, our work at USC showed that what really made the difference for an immigrant deciding to naturalize was the difference in cost between the citizenship fee and the less expensive charge to renew a green card. So it's telling that USCIS is proposing to reduce the cost of a green card by 9%, nearly tripling the price wedge between remaining a lawful permanent resident and becoming a U.S. citizen.
This is a plan destined to lead to fewer immigrants becoming citizens, which may be the point.
The highly respected USCIS is being asked to make a change that will have clear political impact: Immigrants -- who tend to lean liberal and Democratic -- would be less likely and less able to gain the right to vote. The move is reminiscent of the Ukraine scandal in which the traditionally apolitical bureaucracy of the State Department was pressured to contort itself to serve partisan purposes.
After all, a recent New York Times analysis of the Virginia elections -- in which Democrats took full control of both statehouses -- suggests that suburban voters were critical. Important among those swing suburbanites were naturalized immigrants who viscerally rejected Trump's xenophobic rhetoric; as one voter put it: "The way he speaks, you get the feeling that you are separate. This is not what we signed up for in America."
The lessons of Proposition 187 are clear to many observers of California's recent history: Immigrants angry over the 1994 attack on immigrant rights naturalized, voted and helped turn the state blue. Given the wreckage of Republicanism in the Golden State, some might conclude that it would be best to make peace with new Americans, particularly as they and their descendants continue to grow as a share of our population.
But another possible route is to make it harder to naturalize and vote. This may be consistent with a larger Republican effort to disenfranchise the changing electorate -- consider the spate of voter restrictions supported by the GOP -- but it stands in contrast to long-standing, widespread support for immigrants embracing citizenship.
Those who have attended a naturalization ceremony are invariably struck by a profound realization: Becoming American is not about race or religion but about agreeing to a set of principles and values embedded in our history and our Constitution.
Making it harder to become part of the American family may be politically convenient but it runs straight against those values. And if California is any example, it will inevitably backfire.

Texto completo: Authorities arrested a man they said had slashed a giant balloon of a baby Donald Trump that was on display to protest the president's visit to a football game in Alabama on Saturday.
The man, Hoyt Hutchinson, 32, was arrested after officers in Tuscaloosa, Ala., saw him cut the balloon and then try to flee about 1 p.m. Saturday, police said on Facebook. It wasn't clear what Hutchinson had used to slash the balloon.
“I am going down here to make a scene, so y'all watch the news," Hutchinson said in a Facebook Live video before the game.
The balloon, which stands 20 feet tall and 13 feet wide when fully inflated, had been set up at a protest at Monnish Park. Trump attended the game about a mile away at Bryant-Denny Stadium featuring the University of Alabama and Louisiana State University.
Hutchinson was charged with first-degree criminal mischief, police said. He was taken to Tuscaloosa County Jail, posted $2,500 bond, and watched the game's third quarter, the Tuscaloosa News reported.
Hutchinson set up a GoFundMe account, “Restitutions for Baby Trump Stabber," to raise money for his legal fees.
“Hoyt made sure our beloved president didn't have to see this disrespectful balloon on the streets of Ttown today!!" the page says. As of Sunday morning, more than $20,000 had been donated. Hutchinson could not be immediately reached Sunday.
A different GoFundMe campaign called “Get Baby Trump to Tuscaloosa" had drawn more than $7,000 to have the balloon at the protest. Organizers said it cost about $4,000 to bring the balloon, anchor it, and staff it.

Sanders to Bloomberg: 'You ain't gonna buy this election'
Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders let loose a volley of sharp attacks against Michael Bloomberg on Saturday night, accusing the former New York mayor in his bluntest language yet of positioning himself to buy the election and vowing to stop him from doing so.
"Tonight we say to Michael Bloomberg and other billionaires: Sorry, you ain't gonna buy this election," said Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, prompting loud cheers from supporters.
The fiery comments, which marked an escalation from earlier and less direct criticism from Sanders, underscored how Bloomberg's recent steps toward entering the Democratic primary have roiled the contest. They also offered a preview of the jabs Bloomberg could face from other candidates if he decides to jump in the race.
The leading liberal candidates, Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts., have significant ideological differences with Bloomberg that would probably flare up if the former mayor challenges them.
Sanders delivered his remarks at a campaign rally in Coralville, Iowa, that marked the end of a two-day swing through this first caucus state with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York. Sanders will continue campaigning in Iowa on his own Sunday and Monday.
Bloomberg recently walked back his earlier declaration that he would not run for president, moving to file paperwork for the contest, even as he has stopped short of officially entering. A Bloomberg adviser said Friday that if Bloomberg does get in the race, he would not aggressively compete in the first four caucus and primary states. Sanders knocked him over that strategy.
"You're not going to get elected president by avoiding Iowa, by avoiding New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada," warned Sanders. "You're not go to buy this election by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on media in California. Those days are gone."
A Bloomberg adviser did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Klobuchar sees different standard for Buttigieg
Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, said Sunday that women in politics are held to a higher standard than men, arguing that a female candidate with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's experience probably would not make it to the presidential debate stage.
Klobuchar's comments marked the latest instance of a 2020 presidential contender taking aim at Buttigieg, a newcomer on the national political stage whose ascent in the fund-raising race and in polls for the Democratic nomination has taken many by surprise.
They also bring renewed attention to the hurdles female candidates face, following former vice president Joe Biden's description last week of Warren as "angry" and antagonistic.
In an interview on CNN's "State of the Union," Klobuchar, who is on her third term in the Senate, described herself as "the one from the Midwest that's actually won in a statewide race over and over again," adding, "That's not true of Mayor Pete."
A New York Times article on Saturday quoted Klobuchar as saying this summer that she doubts people would take any of the female presidential candidates seriously if they were running with the same qualifications as Buttigieg.
Klobuchar also recently declined to say whether she believes Buttigieg is qualified to be president, the Times reported.
Asked Sunday about those comments, Klobuchar clarified that she does believe Buttigieg is qualified but that she is the better candidate.
Buttigieg's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In the third quarter of the year, Buttigieg raised $19.1 million for his presidential bid, a haul that put him third behind Sanders, who raised $25.3 million, and Warren, who raised $24.6 million. Klobuchar raised $4.8 million in the same period.
Recent polls show Buttigieg gaining ground on Biden, Warren, and Sanders, particularly in Iowa, whose caucuses in February mark the first nominating contest of the 2020 primary race. Klobuchar has remained in the single digits.
The Minnesota Democrat's remarks come as Warren has also spoken out against what she views as a double standard against women on the campaign trail.

Rand Paul: Voter anger at play in Ky. governor's race
Republican US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky says Matt Bevin's recent election performance had more to do with voters' displeasure toward Kentucky's GOP governor than their attitudes about Republicans in general.
Paul said Sunday on NBC's "Meet The Press" that there was "sort of a red wave in Kentucky" but teachers were unhappy and their "anger came out" Tuesday in the governor's race. Republicans won the other five statewide races.
Bevin had a running feud with teachers who opposed his efforts to revamp the state's underfunded public pension systems.
Bevin has refused to concede the governor's race to Democrat Andy Beshear after results showed Bevin trailing by more than 5,000 votes out of more than 1.4 million counted. Bevin requested a recanvass, which is set for Nov. 14.

Texto completo: A well-known professor was charged in Russia after police found him in a river with a bag containing his lover’s dismembered arms.
Oleg Sokolov, 63, is accused of murdering his 24-year-old former student Anastasia Yeshchenko in St. Petersburg. According to the New York Times, Sokolov told the court that he and Yeshchenko had been lovers for five years but “lost control” during an argument and shot her four times with a sawn-off rifle.
“I don't understand how it happened. Something like this has never happened to me before. She attacked me with a knife,” he said. “I repent.”
Sokolov, who worked as a history professor at St. Petersburg State University, was found in the Moyoka River on Saturday morning with a rucksack containing Yeshchenko’s severed arms and a gun that fires rubber bullets. Police have accused him of cutting her apart in order to dump the pieces and hide the crime.
As divers combed the river for more pieces of her body, the skeleton of a man unrelated to the case was discovered. Authorities believe the remaining pieces of Yeshchenko may have been swept out to sea by the current.
Authorities were also investigating reports that Sokolov beat some of his other students.
Sokolov is a renowned professor who specialized in the military history of France. In 2003, French President Jacques Chirac awarded him the country’s highest decoration, the Légion d’honneur, for his studies about French history.
Sokolov is also a historical reenactor who has worked as a consultant for TV and movie reproductions. He has appeared in historical reenactments wearing military uniforms from the Napoleonic era.

The university said in a Saturday statement that it had removed Sokolov from his position on its scientific committee.
“We learn with horror from the press the atrocious crime allegedly committed by Oleg Sokolov,” the statement said. “As professor of modern history at the University of Saint Petersburg ... awarded the French Légion d'Honneur, we would never have imagined that he could have committed this horrible act.”
Sokolov is being held in pre-trial custody.

Police in the Russian city of St. Petersburg are planning to interrogate a prominent professor who has been detained on suspicion of killing a female student after being pulled from a frigid river on Saturday, Nov, 9, 2019 with a backpack containing severed arms.

Bodyguards and backpacks full of cash: Russian influence operation hits Madagascar elections

Texto completo: Russian agents launched a large election influence operation in Madagascar in 2017 in an apparent attempt to win political favor with the administration and secure profitable business operations in the country.
The Russian influence operation was directed by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Russian businessman and close adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the New York Times. The United States has indicted Prigozhin for running election influence operations in the U.S. in 2016.
Prior to Madagascar's last presidential election in 2018, Prigozhin bought a large stake in a Malagasy government-run company selling chromium, a key mineral used in stainless steel production. Prigozhin agreed to support former Madagasy President Hery Rajaonarimampianina in a secret meeting attended by Prigozhin, Putin, and Rajaonarimampianina, according to Russian officials.
Prigozhin ran an influence campaign to help Rajaonarimampianina that included Russian agents with backpacks full of cash offering bribes to opponents to drop out and paying journalists for positive coverage. Russian agents would also show up to opponents' campaign offices with armed bodyguards to intimidate them into dropping out.
Russian agents also funded and pushed the campaign of a Malagasy cult leader, Church of the Apocalypse founder and pastor André Christian Dieudonné Mailhol. The Mailhol campaign was an apparent attempt to split support for Rajaonarimampianina's opponents.
The Russian interference operation was far from professional and was plagued by grifts from its own agents. Agents making purchases for their work would often ask for receipts that showed a price double what they actually paid for goods or services so they could pocket the difference when they filed for reimbursements.
Also, the interference operation did not win Rajaonarimampianina reelection. He lost his reelection bid to challenger Andry Rajoelina. Russian agents made a late switch to campaign for Rajoelina after realizing that Rajaonarimampianina's campaign was doomed. After taking office, Rajoelina allowed Prigozhin to keep his stake in the chromium company.
Prigozhin was a major player in Russian attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election in the U.S. and is connected with various businesses and paramilitary groups.
Prigozhin is currently spearheading Russia's campaign to expand its influence across Africa. He has made deals with a slate of authoritarian leaders across the continent, promising to support their hold on power in return for favors and access, often to profitable, state-run businesses.

Central Florida 100 Our panel of 100 influential leaders discusses the most important issues affecting you. THE TOP STORIES LAST WEEK

Texto completo: NONPROFIT HELP,Dick Batchelor, president, Dick Batchelor Management Group: During the past week, there have been a number of nonprofit forums where organizations are recognized for their generous contributions to address unmet needs in our community, especially the unmet needs of children. There are over 20,000 children in Orange County with no access to health care, 1,400 documented cases of child abuse and very limited resources to offer refuge to those abused. Too many young children with mental-health needs are left without services. It's been said that empathy hits your heart, but compassion hits at your heart and encourages one to do something about the need. While there are so many unmet needs of our children, we are blessed to have those who act on their compassion.
TOP BOND RATING,Lee Constantine, commissioner, Seminole County: State leaders talk of our huge deficits in capital needs, but talk is cheap. Luckily for Florida, so is money. We're at historically low interest rates - borrowing money will never be as inexpensive. Also, Florida has the best bond rating (AAA) in the nation. After years of frugal spending, not using that bond rating is like having a Ferrari and never driving it. As in Jeb Bush's administration, let's bond Florida Forever, water projects and building infrastructure that will benefit generations to come. In my recent meeting with Senate President Bill Galvano, he showed leadership and seemed very receptive. Bonding is a tool we have kept in the shed for too long.
CITRUS CENSORSHIP,Earl Crittenden Jr., chair, onePULSE Foundation: Citing fake news, the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners emphatically overruled the purchase of a New York Times digital subscription for its roughly 70,000 county-wide library-card holders. Even though the library head said citizens overwhelmingly access materials via their digital devices, commissioners instead will allow a single print edition of the newspaper of record to remain available most every day at four library branches. The board ignores the fact that it's more economical, sustainable - and practical - to purchase a digital subscription (at roughly 4 cents per year for each library cardholder). This egregious censorship may be reconsidered as voter reaction has been largely negative.
COLLEGE PARK ICON,Craig Ustler, owner/president, Ustler Development Inc.: College Park lost a true treasure with the passing of Bob Patterson. Bob made the College Park Sunoco a centerpiece of community life. It is the type of old-fashioned "full service" gas station that will never be replicated. I cannot possibly describe what Bob meant to College Park and the thousands of friends he made over the years. He loved his job and cared deeply about his neighbors. The feeling was mutual. People make the place, and Bob leaves a lasting legacy in College Park.
MEAGER TURNOUT,Khalid Muneer, broker/owner Jupiter Properties Central Florida: With the Orlando mayor's election results behind us, it is time to reflect on some facts and figures. With early voting figures showing 79% for incumbent Buddy Dyer, it was always going to be difficult for the other candidates to even come close; hence the importance of early voting. With only 12% of the eligible voters going to the polls, civic organizations need to push for greater citizen participation. With a landslide victory by Mayor Dyer, he has an overwhelming mandate to address some of the most pressing issues - affordable housing, transportation and wages - in the next four years.
TRUMP MIGRATION,Larry Pino, attorney and entrepreneur: News that President Trump is packing up his truck and moving permanently south to Florida might be ironic, but it's not surprising. The 2018 federal tax law instituted a $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions and a $750,000 limit on the amount of mortgage debt which could be written off. As a result, this last year alone, New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut lost some 110,000 migrations to the Sunshine State. With a lavish estate in Palm Beach, President Trump, not known to sidestep personal profit, will be next, saving some six to seven figures in taxes and calling himself a Floridian just in time for the 2020 election.
HEMP RULES,Tara Tedrow, attorney, Lowndes: Did you know that from 2017 to 2018, nationwide acreage planted for hemp tripled, reaching 77,844 acres? And that hemp acreage in 2018 was eight times the acreage planted just two years prior in 2016? There is no shortage of excitement around the opportunities presented by the legalization of hemp, and last week the USDA released interim rules for the hemp industry. These long-awaited regulations provide guidance for states and Indian Tribes in implementing their respective hemp cultivation programs, as well as licensing guidance to those cultivators located in states without any hemp regulations. Stay tuned to see how this latest agricultural commodity impacts industries nationwide.
CLOGGING DOWNTOWN,Anna McPherson, past president, Junior League of Greater Orlando: Mills Avenue at South Street and Anderson is officially shut down as of Nov. 6. That means a major artery running under the 408 is not available to motorists. According to road-construction signage, the road will be shut down until Feb. 3, 2020. Already, the closure has had an effect on traffic patterns. In a city with so much road construction, we can only hope that this project remains on schedule. Local residents recall the very recent Summerlin Avenue project, which ended up taking twice as long as initially projected. In the interim, plan your route carefully and add some extra time to your commute.

Biden's Iraq war walk-back is revisionist history

Texto completo: Former vice president Joe Biden said in a recent interview he agrees with Jim Mattis that the Obama administration's decision to withdraw troops from Iraq was a mistake, but that as vice president he tried to keep "a residual force" stationed there. This is revisionist nonsense. Just a few months ago, at the July Democratic presidential debate, Biden boasted that "one of the proudest moments of my life was to stand there in Al-Faw Palace and tell everyone that ... all our combat troops are coming home." In September, he declared, "We were right to get the combat troops out." But now he agrees it was a mistake?
The fact is, at the time Biden expressed zero regrets about the complete U.S. withdrawal, which he was in charge of executing. The New York Times reports that in December 2011 Biden was "ebullient" as he presided over the departure ceremony for the last American forces, calling President Barack Obama from Baghdad to tell him "All I've said about this job, I take it back. Thank you for giving me the chance to end this goddamn war."
Of course, he did not actually end the "goddamn war," he unleashed a humanitarian and national security catastrophe. Biden's withdrawal created a vacuum that allowed the Islamic State -- which had been reduced to just 700 fighters -- to regroup, reconstitute itself and build a murderous caliphate the size of Great Britain. The terrorists enslaved and raped thousands of Yazidi girls and carried out gruesome executions across Iraq and Syria. And they spread their murderous tentacles across the globe, carrying out 143 attacks in 29 countries that killed over 2,000 people and injured many thousands more.
Biden has criticized President Trump for withdrawing from Syria against the advice of our military commanders. Yet Biden did not listen to our military commanders when it came to the Iraq withdrawal. The Times reports that Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, the U.S. commander in Iraq, proposed keeping as many as 24,000 troops in Iraq. According to Biden national security adviser Colin H. Kahl, Austin was told by the White House "you've got to be kidding." So Austin presented Obama and Biden with options for 19,000, 16,000 and 10,000 troops -- and told them the lowest number was "unwise." But Biden "aggressively pushed for a smaller force," and Obama agreed. Then, during negotiations with the Iraqis, the administration cut the offer in half to just 5,000 -- an offer the Iraqis rejected.
In his interview with the Wall Street Journal, Biden blamed George W. Bush for the U.S. withdrawal, noting that he had negotiated a status of forces agreement that required an end to the U.S. military presence by 2011. Please. Does anyone really believe that if Bush were still in office in 2011, he would have pulled out all U.S. forces? Of course not.
The reason Obama and Biden were unable to get an agreement to extend the U.S. troop presence is because they made it crystal clear to the Iraqis that America was headed for the exits. Iraqis watched as Obama and Biden rejected numbers well above 10,000, only grudgingly agreed to even that number and then cut that number to 5,000. If you were an Iraqi, would this have given you confidence in America's long-term commitment?
Iran and its political allies inside Iraq were pressing for a U.S. withdrawal, and threatening politicians who supported extending the American military presence. For Iraqi leaders, 24,000 American troops might have been worth the political risk, and maybe even 10,000 would have been worth it. But an offer of just 5,000 troops from an administration that was determined to go to zero as quickly as possible was not. If America was leaving, and Iran was staying, why risk siding with the Americans?
In 2013, as the Islamic State was gaining steam, Biden said that he and Obama felt "happy and ... fulfilled" with the decision to withdraw from Iraq. A year later, they would be forced to send U.S. forces back to Iraq to deal with the debacle they had unleashed.
Biden supported the Iraq invasion but then opposed the Bush surge, which crushed the Islamic State and won the war. Then he supported a premature withdrawal that allowed the terrorists to regroup and was celebrating that decision as recently as four months ago -- but now says he regrets it. That's quite a record for a man running on his record of experience and judgment.

Texto completo: Joe Biden is going to win the Democratic nomination for president. I wouldn’t run to your bookie with this information. My track record is spotty, at best. But I’ll be shocked if I’m wrong and I’ll have plenty of company, including many Democrats. I don’t believe Biden is going to win because he’s putting together a great campaign or because he has the best ideas. In fact, if I were advising the former vice president, I would tell him to take some time off. Don’t do anything or say anything. Just kind of disappear for a while. The nomination is in the bag.
Biden will win because Democrats, in their collective heart of hearts, believe he’s the only one who can beat President Donald Trump. Sure, there will be a few more gaffes on the way to the nomination, and he might think he’s in Detroit when he’s actually in San Antonio, but that only makes him more kindly and relatable — an absent-minded uncle who pulls a silver dollar out of your ear.
If there is such a thing as a moderate Democrat these days, Biden is it. His positions on various hot-button issues, such as capital punishment and abortion have moved to the left over the years, but he has not endorsed a "Medicare for all" plan that his Democratic challengers are championing. He’s supported the "spirit" of the Green New Deal, if not the actual proposal, which left many climate activists wondering where he stands. Biden has a plan of his own, which includes elimination carbon emissions by 2050.
While a recent Monmouth University poll showed Biden and Elizabeth Warren in a virtual dead heat, a Fox News poll of likely Democratic primary voters revealed 68 percent believe that Biden can defeat Trump, compared to 57 for Warren. But here’s some news that should give Democrats the heebiest of jeebies; according to a New York Times/Sienna College survey, Trump trails Biden but leads Warren in the battleground states that will ultimately decide the election. Think about that for a second. Looming impeachment, low approval ratings, unrelenting attacks from a media that can’t stand him and still, Trump is competitive in swing states. Considering that the Democrats are actively involved in a primary and Trump really hasn’t started campaigning yet, Democrats should be worried.
If they want to give Trump a gift, they should nominate Warren.
Biden is, indeed, the safe, establishment candidate. You might argue that so was Hillary Clinton. But she had baggage Biden doesn’t — too many people just didn’t like her. Warren has likability issues as well, along with an extreme agenda. Will moderate, blue-collar, union-member voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin vote for Warren? For what it’s worth, the Times survey says "no."
Of course, the Democratic Party will eventually support whichever candidate starts winning primaries and will jettison the others, much like the crew of the Star Trek Enterprise jettisoned Mr. Spock in Wrath of Khan. But for Democrats who believe in an alternative to tepid, "middle-class Joe," I leave you with the words of Spock himself: "It is curious how often you humans manage to obtain that which you do not want."

Texto completo: OLD MONROE -- Less than an hour north of St. Louis, Missouri Highway 79 has dealt with a range of complications and closures from major flooding in recent years. But even when the nearby Mississippi River is calm, the roadway can't catch a break from the elements -- something illustrated this summer, when punishing heat caused its pavement to buckle, creating a bump that work crews had to fix.
With the region -- and practically everywhere -- exposed to hotter and ever more erratic climate conditions, roads like Highway 79 aren't the only types of infrastructure pushed to their breaking points. As society confronts an increasingly unfamiliar climate, there are signs that the engineered backbones of modern civilization are at risk across the U.S.: Rising seas spoiling water supplies. Power plants idled because water from ponds and rivers, used to cool generators, is no longer as chilly as it used to be. Dams threatened by torrential rains and runoff.
New extremes are testing roads, bridges, dams and utilities to unprecedented degrees, even as they age beyond their intended lifespan.
"It's kind of a one-two punch of more stress being put on these systems at a time when they are already fragile," said Mark Abkowitz, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Vanderbilt University with a special focus on infrastructure resilience to extreme weather.
Climate extremes are becoming more common in the region. St. Louis has seen record-high temperatures with greater frequency in recent years, according the National Weather Service -- including a peak of 21 days of record-setting warmth in 2012. It's also not getting as cold here, as shown by a rise in the number of "record-warm lows," in which daily low temperatures register as the warmest on record for a given date. Overall, average annual temperatures in the city are now about 3 degrees warmer than they were 80 years ago.
Moreover, warmer days make weather more extreme: harder rains, deeper snows and more frequent floods -- but also more drought.
That change -- and unpredictability -- matters for engineers who must take climate into account when designing infrastructure, by anticipating the range of conditions that it must withstand. But now, climate-related bell curves and bedrock assumptions are shifting beneath their feet. The same is true for infrastructure that already exists: Some of what was built decades ago now faces conditions that it wasn't designed to withstand.
Rising seas mean that coastal areas not only confront increased tidal flooding, but also underground saltwater intrusion, forcing some Miami-area municipalities, for example, to shut down or relocate well fields for their municipal freshwater supply. Inland, Toledo, Ohio, briefly saw its water supply choked off in 2014 by Lake Erie's toxic algae blooms -- episodes fueled by agricultural runoff, but made more likely in the hot conditions abetted by climate change.
Elsewhere, aging dams and reservoirs are not designed to accommodate increasingly torrential runoff, as shown by evacuations and the threat of failure at California's Oroville Dam in 2017. And widespread fires in the state, fanned by hotter, drier weather, have led utilities to deliberately cut power to hundreds of thousands of residents, to keep power lines from sparking more.
ST. LOUIS HEAT
The St. Louis area offers some of its own examples of infrastructure problems amid hot and extreme conditions. Just ask the local road crews.
"Everything expands when it gets hot. And pavement does the same thing," explained Bob Becker, a maintenance engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation, discussing episodes of pavement buckling. "If that pressure gets great enough, it'll pop up. It's no different than pushing on a piece of paper from both sides."
He says those occurrences -- also known as "blowups" -- typically happen on concrete pavement instead of asphalt surfaces, because the material is less flexible.
"If we have long periods of hot days and hot nights, it makes things worse," said Becker. "It's incredibly weather dependent."
The region's increasingly frequent major floods add to roadway woes, deteriorating asphalt and eroding support materials underneath, according to MoDOT -- which, earlier this year, faced at least $30 million in unexpected damage from high water in the state. The same episodes can increase risk for bridges, by scouring away sediment from around their support structures, Abkowitz said.
Bridges are another place where heat-related complications can arise, with road joints that expand and contract. The joints are designed to wiggle with traffic, wind and weather. And occasionally all of that wiggle leads them to wear out. Temperature extremes mean they could wiggle more and wear out faster.
The heat can hurt the electric grid, too. When historic heat and drought gripped the Midwest in 2012, one power plant shut down because it couldn't access cooling water. Water levels had dropped below the plant's intake pipe, according to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, tasked with managing the electric grid around St. Louis and across parts of 15 states. Multiple plants had to ramp down production that year because cooling water was too warm, according to a report in the New York Times. St. Louis power company Ameren said it had not run into similar issues.
CLOGGED PIPES
Flooding can also complicate operations for riverfront power generating facilities. Amid the region's major floods earlier this year, one Missouri plant had flood debris clog its intake pipe, according to John Grotzinger, the vice president of engineering operations and power supply for the Missouri Public Utility Alliance. Grotzinger didn't identify the plant.
When floodwater was near its apex in early June, the industrial plant that runs a "steam loop" to supply heat and hot water to many downtown St. Louis buildings and hotels was overwhelmed by 10 to 12 feet of water, after a Mississippi River pump station failed. The system's ensuing shutdown came at a highly inopportune time, right as the Stanley Cup Final came to the city, and sparked a desperate scramble to bring in temporary boilers from as far as Chicago, Indianapolis and Minnesota. The substitute boilers served a dozen buildings, including major hotels, a city jail, and parts of Busch Stadium, where the St. Louis Cardinals hosted a weekend series with the Chicago Cubs.
Experts say all of these events are just hints at what might come.
Some are working to prepare. Ameren, for instance, is installing 12,000 new utility poles -- "many fortified with composite materials to better withstand severe weather." It is also adding 400 miles of new cable underground.
MISO said the grid is designed with hot extremes in mind.
Others worry governments and utilities aren't investing in maintenance, and won't adapt fast enough to climate change. And there are immense technical challenges, like the absence of historical precedents, as engineers design things for a more unpredictable, extreme climate.
"There's no question that the folks that construct and maintain our infrastructure are not keeping up with, in my opinion, the practices that they need to consider, going forward," said Abkowitz. "A lot of the design and construction that's going on is sort of based on knowledge that we've accumulated up to this point in time."

Texto completo: Sean Brock, the James Beard Award-winning author of "Heritage" follows up his nationally acclaimed debut book with a decidedly enthusiastic probe into the nurturing and connecting qualities of his favorite cuisine with "South: Essential Recipes and New Explorations."
With an immutable passion for preserving and restoring heirloom ingredients, Brock offers up 125 recipes in "South," with chapters that include everything from "Snacks and Dishes to Share" to "Grains," "Vegetables and Sides" and even a section titled "Pantry," complete with recipes and tips for preserving and canning — not to mention two full pages on "How To Make Vinegar."
Brock was the founding chef of the award-winning Husk restaurants and is now the chef and owner of Audrey, a distinctly unique dining destination set to open in east Nashville next year.
Brock has been recognized with the James Beard Award for Best Chef Southeast in 2010 and was a finalist for Outstanding Chef in 2013, 2014, and 2015. He has appeared on the TV series "Chef's Table" and "The Mind of a Chef," for which he was nominated for an Emmy.
Raised in rural Virginia, Brock now lives in Nashville.
You made a national name for yourself crafting the heritage cuisine of the award-winning Husk restaurants in Charleston and Greenville, South Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, and Nashville. Tell me about your decision to shift gears and settle in Nashville as you start a new chapter of your life and career.
After my son was born, I had a health scare the last couple of years. I realized that I have to take better care of myself. I was working way too much and I worried way too much. I was operating eight restaurants in five cities. Finally, I had to say "goodbye" to that chapter and start a new path.
Your first book, "Heritage," won the James Beard Award for Best American Cookbook and the IACP Julia Child First Book Award, and was called "the blue ribbon chef cookbook of the year" by the New York Times. Were you surprised by its huge success, and would you say that this achievement that helped change your career path?
I can hardly fathom that I ever even got a book deal — and that there would be so much interest in what I was doing with food.
Writing a book is really scary. With my first book, I knew I had one shot to get it out there the way I wanted. There is a gap of about a year between writing a book and getting it published — and a lot can happen in between. Once it's out there, it's out there. All I could do was cross my fingers and hope people would get into it. I remember holding it in my hands after it first came out, and seeing others holding it in their hands. That's when it became real to me.
Winning the James Beard Award was such a stretch that I could have never even imagined it. I remember that day and what a whirlwind of excitement it was.
I think that book came out at a perfect time in America because I began to realize people were really, really interested in Southern food. As a place, it has many cuisines, not just one. It has a strong historical aspect that affects its present and future.
You have said that you believe Southern cuisine ranks among the best in the world. Please tell me about "South," and your motivations for writing it. What message do you want this book to convey?
It's about how we all can contribute to our own food history. The way I see it, place has its own ingredients and its own cultural influences and natural geography. That's how cuisine is shaped — restoring the old so we can now have the new. We look to many cultures much older than ours and how they handled their ingredients. It's important that we can all contribute something to our own culinary history.
You grew up in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia, and attended cooking school in Charleston while you were still a teenager. What influenced your early culinary interests at such a young age?
I grew up living with my grandmother for a while. I was around 11 to 14 years old at that time, and those were such formative years. I loved eating at her table and being in her garden. It gave me a different perspective about food, and I just fell in love with it.
I started working in (restaurant) kitchens at age 15. Food Network had just started on TV, and that was where I began to see that side of food preparation as a more serious craft.
Thanks to my grandmother, I learned the power of food to nurture and comfort, and I never wanted to do anything else.

Remember importance of accountability

Texto completo: It happened during a recent football practice after school. A linebacker on defense broke through the line of scrimmage, disrupting the play of our first-string offense.
As an assistant coach responsible for the offensive line, I approached the linemen and calmly asked what happened, knowing full well what had just occurred.
"It was my fault," said one of the guards almost before I asked the question. "I didn't fire off the ball, I didn't step down, and the linebacker blew through the A-gap. I'm sorry, Coach."
Surprised by the immediacy and honesty of the response, I said simply, "OK, then. You know what to do."
What else could I say? The individual responsible for the error owned up to it and would fix it - the very definition of accountability.
As I replayed that notable moment in my mind afterwards, its singularity became increasingly apparent: Accountability is a dying commodity in our society.
Just think about the news stories you see nowadays.
Fake campaign yard signs appeared in towns like Farmington and Avon during this election season, linking candidates to sexually transmitted diseases or stating plainly, "DEMOCRATS SUCK."
"For as long as I've been doing political work, there always seemed to be shenanigans occurring in local races, but I think what's changed is the tone," said longtime Democratic strategist Roy Occhiogrosso.
Such "shenanigans" are also conducted behind the shadow of anonymity, the antithesis of accountability.
And so it goes in our social-media age. How easy it has become to rant and rave, besmirch and belittle, when you can do it incognito. Even when individuals do put their names behind scathing social-media posts - a common feature of the "cancel culture" that shames unpopular people and demands they be blocked - they are being anything but accountable.
"If I tweet or hashtag about how you didn't do something right or used the wrong verb, then I can sit back and feel pretty good about myself, because, man, you see how woke I was?" said former president Barack Obama at the Obama Foundation Summit on Oct. 29. "That's not bringing about change. If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far. That's easy to do."
Nobody seems to cast more stones than our Tweeter-in-Chief, Donald Trump. A New York Times review of his Twitter account, including more than 11,000 tweets and hundreds of retweets, emphatically makes the point.
Aside from the frequent insults often accompanied with schoolyard-worthy nicknames, the president impulsively endorses dubious material. In sum, the president has retweeted at least 145 unverified accounts that typically promote "conspiracy or fringe content." Twitter has subsequently suspended more than two dozen of those accounts.
"With the arrival of Mr. Trump in the Oval Office, Twitter managed to connect the ultimate seat of power to the darkest corners of the web for the first time," reports the Times. "There is little evidence that Mr. Trump harbors concerns about promoting accounts that traffic in fake or inflammatory material."
The paragon of accountability? Hardly. Instead, the current president of the United States is the primary exemplar of personal responsibility in decline. I'm not making a political statement, mind you; I'm assessing one man's verifiable collection of public statements. Unfortunately, that man happens to hold the most powerful job in the world, a position that young people have traditionally revered.
Undoubtedly, some of those young people also play on the football team I coach.
True story: After practice on that one memorable day, I found myself walking back to the locker room alongside three players, including the one who had earlier spoken so humbly and honestly. These three particular players are also outstanding students in one of my English classes, so I knew they'd welcome a little bookish repartee.
"Hey, guys," I said. "Give me a synonym for 'accountability.'"
"Authenticity," said one.
"Responsibility," said another.
"OK," I responded. "I accept both of those," acknowledging accountability as a concept that encompasses a good variety of qualities. "Those words represent what we expect from every member of a team, don't they?"
All three of them agreed instantly.
Sadly, I fear this country's citizens would no longer be so quick to recognize the attributes of accountability.

Texto completo: The freedom to read and access information and ideas from diverse viewpoints are essential to creating a society of informed citizens. Public libraries play a vital role in this effort to ensure that all people have access to a wide range of information, perspectives and ideas in a variety of formats so they can make informed decisions that impact their lives.
On behalf of the Florida Library Association, representing more than 1,050 members and 60 public and academic institutions, we oppose the recent position taken by the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners in its denial of the library's electronic subscription to the New York Times. We firmly believe that all residents and library visitors should be allowed access to varying viewpoints as promised by their First Amendment rights.
The American Library Association (of which the Florida Library Association is a chapter) maintains the Library Bill of Rights and ALA Code of Ethics to guide libraries in collecting and providing access to a diverse set of materials that do not discriminate on the basis of background or beliefs.
Specifically, the Library Bill of Rights states, "Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all viewpoints on current and historical issues."
Further, libraries and librarians ensure the criteria used to select materials do not discriminate on the basis of factors such as political or religious viewpoint or the background, identity, gender, or beliefs of the publisher or author.
Decisions about which materials are added to a library collection should never be made on the basis of personal or political viewpoints. Selections should be made based on the availability of funds, the needs and interests of library patrons, and in consideration of the library's mission to provide balanced coverage of important topics so that members of the community can educate themselves, draw their own conclusions and participate fully in society.
By restricting access to a specific resource based on personal political beliefs, Citrus County commissioners are denying their constituents the ability to seek and receive information from a wide range of viewpoints and formats.
We expect our civic leaders to review information from all sides of an issue before making a decision that will represent the best interests of the community. We would not want them to make decisions based on incomplete information. We want the same for all members of the public.
In order to uphold Americans' First Amendment rights, governments at any level should not withhold funding or reject proposals to provide library patrons access to any information on the basis of political or personal viewpoints.
The members of the Florida Library Association urge the members of the Citrus County Board of County Commissioners to reconsider the recommendation of library staff and allow the members of the public to decide for themselves which news sources they choose to follow.

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
Fertility is a complex, often overwhelming topic. Searching for explanations -- about how to get pregnant, how to avoid it or even how the term is defined -- yields a mixed bag of heart-wrenching personal essays, dense research and opaque laws. And few clear answers.
That's why Caitlin Roper, the editorial director of New York Times Magazine Labs, and Jessica Grose, the lead editor of NYT Parenting, thought fertility would be the perfect topic for a special section. Ms. Grose then partnered with Amber Williams, an editor on the Labs team, to figure out how to distill the various components of such a complicated subject.
The result: "Your Fertility Now," a detailed (but by no means comprehensive) broadsheet special section that takes readers through the history, current state and future of fertility. Ms. Grose and Ms. Williams recently discussed how they assembled the section, their favorite stories and their hopes for readers. Their conversation has been lightly condensed and edited.
The section is organized into three parts -- the past, present and future. Can you explain the thought process behind this decision?
AMBER WILLIAMS I spent two to three days reading for hours -- materials that Jess's team sent me from their weekly roundup of fertility coverage, as well as my own research about what other magazines, online publications and blogs were doing. Many of those pieces are personal essays that had similar narrative arcs, and my big challenge was: How do we create a varied experience of what you are reading? That ended up being past, present and future, because then you can have distinct pieces on different timelines.
Do you have a favorite piece in the section?
WILLIAMS One of my favorite is called "My Embryo Dilemma," which is a personal essay by Anna Hecker that weaves in a ton of reporting. She has embryos that are on ice, and she has to choose what she's going to do with them. It was a really moving piece because she talks about donating her embryos, which is an option, but obviously it's almost as if they're allowing someone else to adopt your kids, which feels weird. She wonders if she should save them in case a disaster happened, where one of her kids died and she wanted to have another kid. And she is one person who has to grapple with these existential and practical problems. I thought that was a really good piece that brought all these issues together in 800 words.
JESSICA GROSE I really like Jyoti Madhusoodanan's piece about the birth control of tomorrow. The mind-blowing thing for me was how new all of these technologies are, and yet they seem kind of far-fetched. But everything seems possible once you've seen how quickly we've come in such a short period of time.
Fertility is an issue that affects nearly everyone. How did you address that in the section?
WILLIAMS The more pieces I could fit in, the more layered and nuanced we could be -- there are pieces that are just about the trans pregnancy experience, there are pieces just about male infertility, there are pieces just about female infertility. But I hope that readers will notice that there are inclusive terms. In the period stigma piece, sometimes Chris Bobel says "women," but sometimes she says "menstruators," and there are also places where you will see "people with eggs" or "people with sperm." The idea is that we are weaving it all together.
GROSE Any time you are dealing with medical things, there is an opportunity to ask, "O.K., is this advice really only going to apply to one set of people?" We've heard about getting it wrong, and we are always striving to do better, but I think within each piece you can always put that thought into it.
What are your goals for this section -- on its own and as it relates to the Parenting vertical?
WILLIAMS One thing that is important to me is the idea that every person deals with fertility. A goal of the section is for any breadth of our readers to feel engaged; to not feel ostracized; and to learn about things that affect their decisions now, things that might affect their decisions in the future and things that might affect their children or grandchildren. It should be accessible to everyone -- to have you think about the ways in which we talk about it, how laws have stigmatized it, how society has defined it and science has revolutionized it.
GROSE In terms of Parenting, one of the things that was really important to me when I started this was that I felt that most parenting stuff I read on the internet made me feel worse about myself. Either because it was just a random person on a forum saying terrible things, or it was information that, while accurate, was framed in a way to shame. Having this section and having the product also be as inclusive and nonjudgmental as possible as a founding idea was really important to us. The last thing that I ever want is for people to read the product and feel worse about themselves or their parenting afterward.
How can readers engage with this content in the future with The Times? What are your plans, if any, for the future life of this section and topic?
GROSE We've actually been following this couple, Nikki and Brittany, throughout their fertility journey. They describe the process of going through IUI and then IVF, and it's a conversation between the two of them. In January, we're going to have a collaboration with the National section where we spend time with women across the country in the month after they have a child and see how that experience is different for different people. This is based on only one set of data, but there is a statistic out there that a quarter of American women go back to work within two weeks of giving birth, which is wild and awful. We will continue to be a place where we are not only talking about these issues, but we also have really vetted research and up-to-date service.

Texto completo: Democrats in Battleground States Prefer Moderate Nominee, Poll Shows
WASHINGTON -- Democrats in the country's most pivotal general election battlegrounds prefer a moderate presidential nominee who would seek common ground with Republicans rather than pursue an ambitious, progressive agenda, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of primary voters across six states.
As the Democratic candidates intensify their argument over how best to defeat President Trump, their core voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona and Florida are counseling them to pursue a political middle ground.
A majority of those surveyed said they wanted a Democratic nominee who is more moderate than most Democrats, and they overwhelmingly preferred one who would bridge the partisan divide in Washington.
The party's voters are more evenly split on the scale of change they are seeking from their nominee: 49 percent said they preferred a candidate who would return politics in Washington to normal, while 45 percent hope for one who will bring fundamental change to American society.
The poll showed a top tier of three candidates in the battleground states: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden was leading in five of the six states, while Ms. Warren enjoyed a narrow advantage within the margin of error in Wisconsin, where Mr. Sanders also appeared strong. No other candidate registered in double digits in any of the states surveyed.
While Democrats have unambiguously moved to the left in the decade since President Barack Obama took office, as Republicans eagerly point out, the poll illustrates that the party's identity is more complex than the opposition and some progressive activists would portray it.
Democratic voters in the six states, each of which Mr. Trump carried three years ago, are split almost equally in how they described themselves ideologically: 49 percent say they are moderate or conservative, while 48 percent indicate they are very liberal or somewhat liberal.
And this presidential primary reflects the party's contrasting impulses.
Primary voters who long for a moderate standard-bearer and a return to normalcy in Washington strongly prefer Mr. Biden, according to the survey. Those Democrats who prefer a progressive nominee and want them to fight for a bold agenda while bringing systemic change to American society are nearly evenly divided between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
The divisions go beyond ideology and ambition: Older, nonwhite Democrats and those without college degrees strongly favor Mr. Biden. But younger Democrats of all races prefer Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, while those with college degrees overwhelmingly prefer Ms. Warren.
None of the six states where voters were polled are casting ballots in the first stage of the primary next year, and only North Carolina votes on Super Tuesday, in early March, immediately after the initial early-voting states. So the candidate preferences could change by the time these states hold their nominating contests.
The Times/Siena survey of 1,568 Democratic primary voters in the six states was conducted from Oct. 13 to 26. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. Sampling error in individual states is higher.
In preferences for individual candidates, the major distinction between the six states and Iowa, where The Times and Siena polled caucusgoers late last month, is that Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., is in the top tier with Ms. Warren, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in Iowa. But he has scant support in the battleground states and despite winning a wave of attention in recent months, he was one of several candidates to poll at zero percent among black voters in those states.
The ideological and generational divisions shaping this primary are strikingly similar in the Iowa and battleground surveys. Mr. Biden has nearly three times the support from voters over 65 that he does among those 29 and younger. And he does three times better among self-described moderates and conservatives than he does among those who say they are very liberal.
The former vice president's support from older voters is especially pronounced among nonwhite Democrats. Nearly half of the racial minorities surveyed who were 45 and older backed Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders received 10 percent and Ms. Warren 9 percent.
What's more ominous for Mr. Biden is that his support with younger nonwhite voters is far more tenuous: Among racial minorities under 45, Mr. Sanders was the favorite at 28 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 19 percent and Mr. Biden at only 11 percent.
Xiomara Alarcon, a 24-year-old postal worker from Greensboro, N.C., described Mr. Sanders as "pure-hearted," a true-believing advocate for progressive policies like "Medicare for all." She also approvingly noted that he was arrested as a young activist in 1963.
"He fights for all people of color," said Ms. Alarcon, who identifies as Hispanic. "Not just himself and his people."
Among African-American voters of all ages in the six states, Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite, receiving 42 percent of that vote. Ms. Warren captured 13 percent, and Mr. Sanders had 10 percent.
That finding aligns with other polling through the year that reinforces Mr. Biden's high standing with black voters, forged through ties with congressional and community leaders, and most significantly, through his relationship with former President Obama.
"He was Obama's vice president and some of the things Obama supported, he supported," Michael Elliott, 61, of Jacksonville, Fla., said of Mr. Biden. "Vice president, that's as close as you can get to being a president. I'm looking at experience, too."
Nearly 300 miles down the Florida coast, William Stewart, 39, raised concerns about Mr. Biden's ability to appeal to younger voters and said he was currently supporting Ms. Warren.
"It would be great for a woman to be president," said Mr. Stewart, of West Palm Beach. Mr. Stewart, a logistics manager, identifies as African-American. "I believe in some of the thoughts she has about health care and equal rights for everybody."
As for Mr. Biden, he said, "I have a little reservation about if he's connecting with the younger people."
Ms. Warren was strongest among voters who identified as "very liberal," winning 35 percent, while Mr. Biden captured just 13 percent of those voters. She also dominated with white college graduates, capturing 33 percent, far more than Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Biden was strongest among white voters without a four-year degree, taking 30 percent -- double Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, who both captured 15 percent of these voters.
"Joe Biden has the experience," said Diane Ethridge, 60, of Green Bay, Wis. "I also think he's more willing to listen and he will do far better with trade with this country, he will do far better, I think also even in the Democratic Party, with health care."
Ms. Ethridge, who attended vocational school and worked at a phone company, said she opposed Medicare for all and efforts to make college free, proposals supported in various forms by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders.
"She's doing well in the polls," she said of Ms. Warren, "but I am not for her political platform of Medicare for all. I don't know where this money is going to be coming from. I am not in favor of education for all, either. I don't feel we should be paying for someone who could afford to pay for it."

Even some of Ms. Warren's supporters expressed concerns about the practical and political considerations of her Medicare for all plan.
Ms. Warren has said her proposal will not raise taxes on the middle class. Last Friday she unveiled a plan describing how she would pay for an initiative that she says would cost $ 20.5 trillion in new federal spending over a decade.
"I'm very skeptical" about the tax implications, Mr. Stewart, of Florida, said. "That's the only discrepancy. I don't know how it's possible."

New York Times: Biden greeted Buttigieg in 'voice dripping with condescension'

Texto completo: Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg has been a less than welcome presence among others vying for the nomination along the campaign trail.
More experienced Democrats hoping to clinch the 2020 Democratic nomination have seen Buttigieg's rise to fame and successful fundraising as a thorn in their own efforts. During an early campaign stop, former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, was surprised to see the 37-year-old South Bend, Indiana, mayor approach him for a greeting. "'Hello, Mr. President,' Mr. Biden said, in a voice dripping with condescension," noted an article in the New York Times.
"In the still-crowded Democratic presidential field, one man has triggered an outpouring of resentment and angst," it said. "It’s not Donald Trump." Buttigieg, whose only effort to achieve public office higher than mayor was an unsuccessful run for Indiana state treasurer, has raised substantial money from high-dollar and grassroots donors as his campaign has gained steam. He has raised more money than any other Democratic candidate except independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
California Sen. Kamala Harris called Buttigieg "naive" after he said the Democratic primary was getting to be a "two-way race" between him and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Biden also dismissed Buttigieg's claim that he was headed to the front of the pack. "Well, good, I hope they do well," he said.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar expressed agitation that Buttigieg's star continued to rise despite his limited qualifications. "Could we be running with less experience than we had? I don’t think so,” she said. “I don’t think people would take us seriously ... I think it’s important to look at someone’s track record to see what’s happened when they’ve run statewide,” she said. “There’s got to be some value put on someone that has been able consistently to show that they can bring people with them. Not in one fluke race, but every single time."
Buttigieg dismissed concerns that his lack of service in high office should be a handicap to his campaign. "This is not a contest for who is the most established, it’s a contest for who is the most convincing,” he said. “The better we do, I imagine the more we’ll feel some heat, but that just means we’re doing well."
Beto O'Rourke, 47, a similarly young, inexperienced candidate who ended his bid for the presidency last Friday, was also miffed by Buttigieg's success on the campaign trail and referred to him as a "human weather vane." Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, 45, chided Buttigieg for being unable to attract minority voters. "It is very risky to nominate a candidate that can’t attract black and Latino voters,” he said. “He’s going by the old playbook of following the focus groups, going by what political consultants tell you."
Buttigieg is currently polling at a national average of 7%, trailing only Biden, Sanders, and Warren. Last weekend, at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Liberty and Justice Celebration, Buttigieg secured the coveted first speaking slot and was greeted by nearly 16,000 people. He told the crowd the current runner-up, Elizabeth Warren, was delivering a costly and divisive message in her campaign. When it was her turn to speak, Warren fired back. "I’m not running some consultant-driven campaign with some vague ideas that are designed not to offend anyone,” she said. The last to speak, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, said of Buttigieg to the significantly shrunken crowd, "He got 9,000 votes in a college town that last voted for a Republican in 1964."
Dismissing the litany of disparaging remarks from the field of fellow Democratic candidates, Buttigieg vowed to forge on. "I’m not going to comment on the emotions of my competitors," he said.

When you're pregnant, joy and anxiety often intertwine. l Unfortunately, fears about something going wrong are not entirely unfounded. New Jersey ranks fifth highest in maternal mortality rates, based on data from 46 states analyzed in a USA TODAY investigation in 2018. That means that out of every 100,000 births in New Jersey, 37 moms die. l The United States, which has the highest maternal death rate among developed countries, is one of only three nations – the others are Afghanistan and Sudan – where the maternal mortality rate is rising, according to the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health, an organization aimed at reducing harm to women in health care.
To address these problems, First Lady Tammy Murphy has established Nurture NJ, an awareness campaign committed to reducing infant and maternal mortality and morbidity and ensuring equitable maternal and infant care among women and children of all races and ethnicities.
"The color of your skin," Tammy Murphy said in a video on the website of the office of the governor, "should not impact the quality of the care you get or your chances of surviving maternity or surviving your first year of birth."
How do you continue to tamp down all those concerns? With education. With assertiveness. With help from people you trust.
And, perhaps, with help from a doula.
What is a doula? A doula's job is to help pregnant women navigate the nine months that lead to motherhood.
A bill that passed in the New Jersey state Assembly in March aims to improve access to doula services by expanding Medicaid coverage, but federal approval is needed before the bill can have any lasting impact.
Doulas provide non-medical assistance to women during pregnancy, childbirth and the post-partum period. Sometimes known as "birth sisters," doulas serve as coaches and all-around helpers to the pregnant woman and her birth partner.
They can perform acupressure and other comfort measures during labor. They give encouragement to a laboring woman and her partner. They are trained professionals who give continuous physical and emotional support, as well as up-to-date, evidence-based research and information.
"We don't take away anything from the doctor," said Angela Turner, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey in Camden. "We work with the mothers, in pre-natal care, asking them, 'What plans do you have? What kind of birth do you want?' with the understanding that birth is unpredictable."
Turner recalled the labor experience of a client whose goal was to have a fully natural childbirth. At 41 weeks of pregnancy, however, she agreed to be induced, but, with the backing of Turner as her doula, she was still able to remain in control of the process.
"She requested female doctors and staff. She wanted lights off," Turner said. "She wanted family members in the room, and she wanted to be able to move around. She wanted time to herself for prayer, with nobody in the room."
"Her doctors were on board with what she wanted," Turner said. "They just waited and watched, as her body did what it was supposed to do. And she had a wonderful childbirth experience."
An ancient practice In some cultures, relatives routinely serve as unofficial doulas, with mothers, grandmothers or aunts helping women as they give birth.
"My family is from the Dominican Republic," said Cristina Ramos, a doula based in the Somerset section of Franklin. "My oldest aunt has been attending family births for 50 years, beginning at age 18. She was a lay doula."
Later, after Ramos became a mother, she, too, took up that role for her extended family.
When Ramos learned that a friend was training to become a professional doula through Doulas Of North America (DONA), she said to herself, "That's pretty much what I do," and switched from a career in sales to one as a doula.
Ronsha Dickerson, director of Community Doulas of South Jersey, says the presence of a doula in a hospital's labor and delivery ward serves to validate and empower pregnant women.
"Our goal is that moms feel they have value in that room," Dickerson said.
Hill knows first hand the difference that extra cheerleader can make. She has four daughters, and each birth was different. Hill's mother accompanied her for the first birth, and she credits her mom's company with helping her make it through labor unmedicated.
"For the second one, my mom got caught in traffic," Hill said. "I noticed a difference right away. It was a horrible experience."
Hilll's third and fourth child were born by C section, so she did not labor.
"Doulas provide continuity of care," Ramos said. "It doesn't matter how long it takes, I will be there for the entire birth."
Meeting moms' needs Most importantly, doulas serve as advocates. They make sure that a pregnant woman's needs are met and her wishes are respected.
Ramos said she asks many questions of prospective clients: "What kind of birth do you want?" "What forms of intervention do you want or not want?" And one that may come as a surprise: "Are you confident that your provider is looking out for your best interests?"
Ramos advises clients to shop around for a doctor or midwife, hospital or birthing center, until they find what feels right.
Advocacy can be especially important for women of color.
As reported in June by the USA TODAY Network, the overwhelming majority of women who die or suffer catastrophic injury in birth or post-delivery are African-American women.
Why does this happen? Doulas say the answer is very simple. "People in the medical field," Ramos said, "they just don't listen."
New Jersey Assemblywoman Shavonda Sumter told a reporter for lohud.com that New Jersey Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal "hit the nail on the head" when he said, "It's implicit bias."
The phenomenon of "weathering," or the toll that is exacted on African-American women's bodies from the grinding stress of systemic racism, was examined in an influential 2018 article in the New York Times Magazine by Linda Villarosa. "Weathering" cuts across class, education and income levels, and lifestyle factors.
Alynson Sloan-Anderson, a doula with Community Doulas of South Jersey, said the support of a doula can mitigate some of that bone-deep stress that African-American women carry.
"It's important because it empowers black and brown women who have traditionally been underrepresented and overlooked," Sloan-Anderson said. "There's a level of trust that needs to be built up, to where they can say, 'I trust you to come into my home,' and we go in with a non-judgmental attitude, and help them use their voices and advocate for themselves to ensure their health and the health of their babies."
"I have always had women of color in my client base," Ramos said, "but I am hearing from more African-American women professionals who are reaching out in fear. I ask them, 'Why do you want a doula?' and they say, 'I am going to die. My cousin almost died. No one listened to her and she was hemorrhaging.' We have to get them to let go of the fear."
"We need an intervention," Hill said, "because doctors aren't listening, not hearing, they're just going by the book. Not everyone's body is the same."
Numerous studies have shown that women who receive continuous support in labor from a doula have decreased rates of C sections and give birth to healthier babies. CREDIT: Kelly-Jane Cotter

Texto completo: The book seems to be the product of a Republican with access to the White House who grew increasingly upset by President Trump.
For President Trump, leaks are maddening and anonymity is infuriating. So the release of "A Warning," the new book by "Anonymous," an unidentified senior official in the Trump administration who first wrote about the current White House in an opinion article in The New York Times, did not make for a good Friday for the president.
Here are some takeaways about what the book shows -- and about what it doesn't.
The picture it paints of the president and the White House is bleak, but not new.
"The White House, quite simply, is broken," the author says at one point. At another, the author writes that the president often acts on his impulses, even when he's been talked out of them, whether it's in relation to policy matters or possibly dismissing a staff member.
"His cyclical urges can't be suppressed for long," the author writes.
His lack of interest in other branches of government is a constant theme.
"Don't worry about Congress," he is supposed to have told an aide. "Just do what you need to do."
These ideas don't tread new ground -- the themes were hit on, in more elaborate detail, in books by Michael Wolff and Bob Woodward earlier in the Trump presidency. Both writers painted the Trump presidency as aberrant and potentially dangerous, with detailed scenes describing actions by the president.
Throughout "A Warning," there are descriptions of Mr. Trump repeatedly testing the bounds of the law, or in some cases, ignoring them outright. The author attributes it in part to his lack of familiarity with the executive branch after a lifetime in business.
"In fairness, when Trump suggests doing something unlawful, it's not necessarily nefarious," the author writes.
Still, the author describes Mr. Trump bluntly as unlearned, intellectually incurious and sometimes consumed with frustration about leaks.
Anonymous recounts few new scenes -- other than an account of aides discussing using the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump and officials possibly resigning en masse. More often he describes aides asking, "What the hell happened?" in response to what the president had just done.
For instance, the author "vividly" remembers one instance when "an official" called the author the evening after a "top intelligence leader" went to testify on Capitol Hill. "'The president's red hot,' she told me," the author writes. "'It sounds like he wants someone fired by morning."'
"'What the hell happened?' I asked. She explained that the agency head offered an assessment about one of America's foreign adversaries. The conclusion was at odds with what Trump had been saying publicly."
"Anonymous" writes authoritatively ...
One of the key differences between previous books and this one is that it is described as an insider's account.
There are moments it is clear that Anonymous has either witnessed Mr. Trump in private settings or talked to a number of people who have.
At one point the author writes that the president announced he wanted to reduce the number of judges -- a statement that echoes Mr. Trump's well-documented disinterest in the authority of other branches of government.
Other moments he recounts that seem to indicate a fly on the wall perspective are the descriptions of Mr. Trump's interactions with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
"Jared, you don't know what you're talking about, O.K.?" the exasperated president is quoted as saying at one point. "I mean seriously. You don't know."
At other times, the author writes, Mr. Kushner's drift into a number of policy issues had him defending Saudi officials and trying to empathize with their concerns about Yemen.
The president has frequently snapped at Mr. Kushner in settings around other aides, and the account will sound familiar to a number of current and former White House officials.
... but sometimes strikes a wrong note.
There are key moments where "Anonymous" appears to be masking a lack of direct knowledge by simply repeating public accounts of Mr. Trump's words or behavior.
That includes references to his derogatory remarks about women's appearances, many of which have been made in public over many years.
It also includes some of the administration's more difficult moments, like Mr. Trump's comments around a white supremacist rally and violence in Charlottesville, Va., without providing any actual new insight other than that aides were slack-jawed at his comments.
More specifically, certain episodes are mischaracterized, like what happened around the departure of Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence, and his deputy, Sue Gordon. He suggested they left as a result of a simple firing, while the reality was a more complicated dynamic.
Elsewhere in the book, the author states that Mr. Trump was actively considering replacing Vice President Mike Pence with Nikki R. Haley, his former ambassador to the United Nations, but spends just a paragraph on it and doesn't explain what he or she knows, or how.
And the author asserts that the president had to have been involved in an unnamed ally of the president suggesting on television in June 2017 that Mr. Trump might fire the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, but the writer did not provide any supporting evidence.
A few clues suggest who the author could be.
There is a reason for the lack of specific scenes and tendency to write in generalities. The reason, Anonymous writes, is the hope of not being a "distraction" by being identified.
"For now, if asked, I will strenuously deny I am the author of this book, including when the president demands we each disavow it," the author writes.
Still, there are a few tells about who the person could be, suggesting the author is a Republican who comes from the party's establishment wing.
The author writes at the beginning of the book that it was possible to overlook any number of Trump controversies. But the final straw for Anonymous was the president's reaction to the death of Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, former prisoner of war and nemesis of the president's.
"I'd spent enough time watching one pointless indignity after another," the author writes. "This one, targeting a veteran and former P.O.W., was the last straw. What did it say about our president?"
The author doesn't explain why it was only Mr. Trump's conduct toward Mr. McCain in death, as opposed to his myriad criticisms of the senator in life, that had a chilling effect.
But Anonymous writes with what might be firsthand knowledge about the president's frustrations at the attention and public embrace Mr. McCain received upon his death. The author also appears to have access to the discussions around whether to lower the flag at the White House to honor Mr. McCain's passing.
That leaves the impression that it's someone on the White House campus, and possibly inside the West Wing.
The president will hate the book.
Anonymous's conclusion that the president is running perhaps the most inept and dysfunctional White House in history will vex and bother Mr. Trump. But what might bother him the most is the description of his lack of fitness for the role and his lack of interest in adapting to the job, or learning about the government he oversees.
Repeatedly, Anonymous describes Mr. Trump as not fully understanding the basic mechanics of governing -- asking the attorney general to do jobs outside his portfolio, for instance, or asking Mr. Kushner to take over any number of roles. "He tells the secretary of defense to do things that are the responsibility of the secretary of state," the author writes. "He tells the attorney general to do things that are the job of the director of national intelligence. Sometimes he tells his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to do all of their jobs at once, including reimagining care for America's veterans, negotiating Middle East peace, spearheading criminal justice reform, and undertaking delicate conversations with foreign allies."
Mr. Trump, who is sensitive to criticism that he ignores briefing books and might not be up to the task, would bristle at the portrayal of him as a version of Chance, the simple-minded, television-consuming gardener in the book and movie "Being There" who, through a series of misunderstandings, adopts the name Chauncey Gardiner and becomes top adviser to a Washington figure.
But Mr. Trump's aides are cautioning him to ignore the book, because it will only give it more oxygen.
So far, that has worked.

U.S. envoy in Syria assails Trump inaction

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The top American diplomat on the ground in northern Syria has criticized the Trump administration for not trying harder to prevent Turkey's military offensive there last month - and said Turkish-backed militia fighters committed "war crimes and ethnic cleansing."
In a searing internal memo, the diplomat, William V. Roebuck, raised the question of whether tougher U.S. diplomacy, blunter threats of economic sanctions and increased military patrols could have deterred Turkey from attacking. Similar measures had dissuaded Turkish military action before.
"It's a tough call, and the answer is probably not," Roebuck wrote in the 3,200-word memo. "But we won't know because we didn't try." He did note several reasons the Turks might not have been deterred: the small U.S. military presence at two border outposts, Turkey's decade-slong standing as a NATO ally and its formidable army massing at the Syrian frontier.
In an unusually blunt critique, Roebuck said the political and military turmoil that upended the administration's policy in northern Syria - and left Syrian Kurdish allies abandoned and opened the door for a possible Islamic State resurgence - was a "sideshow" to the bloody, yearslong upheaval in Syria overall.
But, he said, "it is a catastrophic sideshow and it is to a significant degree of our making."
Roebuck, a respected 27-year diplomat and former U.S. ambassador to Bahrain, sent the unclassified memo Oct. 31 to his boss, James F. Jeffrey, the State Department's special envoy on Syria policy, and to about four dozen State Department, White House and Pentagon officials who work on Syria issues. Roebuck is Jeffrey's deputy.
The New York Times obtained a copy of the memo from someone who said it was important to make Roebuck's assessment public. Jeffrey and Roebuck declined to comment Thursday.
Morgan Ortagus, the State Department spokeswoman, also declined to comment on Roebuck's memo. "That said, we have made clear that we strongly disagreed with President Erdogan's decision to enter Syria and that we did everything short of a military confrontation to prevent it," Ortagus said in a statement Thursday.
"No one can deny that the situation in Syria is very complicated, and there are no easy solutions and no easy choices," she said. "There will always be a variety of opinions on how this complex situation should be managed. This administration's job is to do what is best for U.S. national security and the American people. That is what we have done in Syria and what we will continue to do."
Roebuck's memo appears to be the first formal expression of dissent on Syria from a Trump administration official to be made public. Pentagon officials voiced alarm by the sudden shift in Syria policy, but top officials never made their views public.
Roebuck's memo also comes as the president already has expressed disdain for some State Department officials because of their testimony in Congress during the impeachment inquiry over Ukraine policy.
Roebuck focused his harshest criticism on Turkey's military offensive and specifically on Turkey's deployment of Syrian Arab fighters in its vanguard force. Roebuck added his voice to accusations by human rights groups that these fighters have killed Kurdish prisoners, including one of them lying on the ground with his hands bound behind his back, and committed other atrocities as they emptied major Kurdish population centers in northern Syria.
"Turkey's military operation in northern Syria, spearheaded by armed Islamist groups on its payroll, represents an intentioned-laced effort at ethnic cleansing," Roebuck wrote, calling the abuses "what can only be described as war crimes and ethnic cleansing."

Saving $2,700 is not book-burning

So there is a big stink in Citrus County because county commissioners announced their intent not to pay $2,700 for an annual digital library subscription to the New York Times. First, the question that should always be asked when public funds are involved: How many of Citrus Countys more than 140,000 residents have actually accessed the New York Times through that subscription each year? Can a $2,700 subscription be justified? Is it unreasonable for conservatives (68 percent of Citrus voters voted for Donald Trump) not to pay $2,700 each year to make a left-leaning newspaper available in digital format? (Paper copies are still available.) A few observations regarding the progressive Coffee Coalition protesters:

1. One of them showed disrespect/intolerance by scoffing, A prayer? at the invocation.

2. Sounds like a lot of the protesters are confused about what censorship really means. No one is burning books in Inverness.

3. The protesters booed her down when one woman spoke in support of the commissioners, and half of them left before the commissioners took their turn speaking. That kind of intolerance seems to be rearing its hypocritical head a lot these days, on college campuses and in public forums.

Looking out for consumers

Kudos to Julie Brown and the other members of the Florida Public Service Commission for rejecting the major utilities plan to eliminate programs that help their customers save energy. It was a bold move by this commission that in years past has been a rubber stamp for the utilities. Unfortunately for the four who voted for rejection, they will probably be replaced as soon as their terms expire.

Be alert behind the wheel

As I sat at a traffic light one recent morning at Hanley Road and Hillsborough Avenue, I watched a pick-up blow past a stopped school bus. Last week, a child was hit in Pasco County. The disregard for life and disrespect of laws floors me. When I received my driver license more than 40 years ago my father, a professional truck driver, asked me to show it to him. Before he returned it, he said, This is a privilege, not a right, and you need to remember that and that the vehicle is a two-ton (cars were much heavier then) weapon under your control, and you are responsible for it. Those wise words have always remained with me.

Putting a price on pollution

The best chance of cleaning up plastic pollution is to assess a bounty on bags and bottles, per item or by the pound. What is it worth for the future of the world? Glass containers are costlier but can be recycled. Paper bags cost trees but are recyclable. As the Earth and oceans are being destroyed, policies should require special funding to aid in cleaning up and stopping these problems. If recycling machines that could automatically issue a cash refund for each aluminum can and plastic bottle dropped in a designated bin were installed in retail parking lots, this type of litter would practically cease to exist.

Texto completo: A top aide to 2020 Democrat Tom Steyer's campaign has resigned after offering campaign contributions to Iowa politicians in exchange for their endorsement of the billionaire candidate.
While Pat Murphy defended his actions as aboveboard and claimed the controversy stemmed from a "miscommunication" after Thursday's revelation, he resigned the next day. A statement from Steyer's campaign confirmed his departure Friday.
"After the conclusion of an investigation alleging improper communications with elected officials in Iowa, Pat Murphy has offered his resignation from the campaign effective immediately,” the statement read. “Our campaign policy is clear that we will not engage in this kind of activity, or any kind of communication that could be perceived as improper. Violation of this policy will not be tolerated."
No Iowa politicians admitted to accepting the donations. Murphy, who was once the Iowa House speaker, blamed the "tricky" endorsement process and said he never meant to make "my former colleagues uncomfortable" on Thursday.
"As a former legislator, I know how tricky the endorsement process can be for folks in Iowa," he said in a statement. "It was never my intention to make my former colleagues uncomfortable, and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part."
Steyer, 62, who is polling at an average of less than 1%, was also under fire last week when a South Carolina campaign aide was accused of trying to steal volunteer data from fellow contender Sen. Kamala Harris. Steyer has spent more than $47 million of his own money on his 2020 presidential bid, prompting criticism that he could be trying to buy his way into the White House.

Texto completo: Among the people I love is a sibling who works at Walmart cleaning toilets at night in a thinly populated part of eastern Oregon. She’s been there more than 25 years and has trouble saving a dime and certainly no path to retirement. She’s likely to vote, again, for President Donald Trump.
No matter how much I point out that Trump is trying to take away her health care protections by litigating to kill Obamacare, that his tariffs have made it harder to pay her bills, that he is the most repulsive and creepy man ever to occupy the White House, she holds firm.
Why? One reason is what she hears from the other side. Many Democrats, she says, are dismissive of her religious beliefs and condescending of her lot in life. She’s turned off by the virtue-signaling know-it-alls.
It’s no mystery why so many Democrats can no longer connect to the white working class. Progressives promise free college, free health care, free child care, and scream in bafflement, What’s wrong with you people?
No doubt, some of those people are racist and xenophobic. But many others simply feel insulted and dismissed. And these are voters who can still be persuaded to save our country from a disastrous second term of a corrupt and unstable president.
Barack Obama, still the smartest politician in the land, knows this; a week ago, he rightfully called out the call-out culture that marginalizes so many people who are ready to vote against Trump.
“This idea of purity and you’re never compromised and you’re always politically ‘woke’ and all that stuff,” he said, to a round of applause. “You should get over that quickly.” He was talking about an attitude, not necessarily policies — an attitude that dominates the bullying fringe of his own party. Predictably, he was called out for being paternalistic, with a boomer attitude.
If anyone should feel victimized by social media hatred and cancel culture of a different sort it is Obama. More than a third of Republicans tried to delegitimize him, believing in the monstrous falsity that he was born in Kenya.
Joe Biden has picked up Obama’s charge against the puritanical keepers of undiluted progressivism, in self-defense. He wrote this week of a “my way or the highway” approach that is “condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.” He said, “It’s representative of an elitism that working and middle class people do not share: ‘We know best; you know nothing.’”
For the record, I’m agnostic on the Democratic field. I would vote for a tree stump if it could beat Trump. Biden, Obama and Nancy Pelosi, along with recent polling and the election results Tuesday, all show that the best way to rid this country of Trump is for Democrats to dial back the condescension of their natural allies and dig into the gritty concerns of daily life.
Pete Buttigieg, looking to pick up the moderate left vote if Biden falters, has already taken Obama’s lesson to heart. “I’m not about being in the right place ideologically, whatever that means,” he said in Iowa last week. “I’m about having answers that are going to make sense.”
One of the biggest takeaways from the recent New York Times/Siena College survey of battleground states is that Elizabeth Warren is not connecting with the very people her policies are supposed to help. Trump beats her or runs even in every tossup state but one. The persuadable voters in these states, many of them working class, say political correctness has gotten out of control, and they prefer someone seeking common ground over someone with a militantly progressive agenda.
It’s worth remembering that nearly two-thirds of all American adults do not have a four-year college degree. Warren, the Harvard professor who recently suggested that moderate Democrats belong with the other party, could be more effective with these folks if she showed more of her daughter-of-a-janitor side.
You can try to win the election by expanding the pool of progressive voters overall. But the inconvenient fact remains that a relatively small pool of working-class voters in the handful of battleground states are still likely to determine the fate of the country next year.
Democrats flipped 40 House seats in 2018 and attracted more white working-class voters — without insufferable wokedness. They hammered away on health care and kitchen table concerns. The same approach helped Democrats pull off an apparent upset in the Kentucky governor’s race this week.
Next year, Trump will be the greatest motivator and unifier for a majority of Americans poised to throw him out. For his core 40%, there’s no crime or debasement that will change their minds. He can indeed shoot someone, as a focus group participant helpfully clarified this week, and likely get a pass from the Cult of Trump.
But for others, those like my sister, a word to Democrats: Talk to them. Don’t talk over them. Save the piety, the circular firing squad, the shaming on social media for after the election. Otherwise, the woke will wake next Nov. 3 to a tragedy.

Business briefly: Juul halts US sales of mint-flavored e-cigarettes

Texto completo: Juul Labs said Thursday it will halt U.S. sales of its best-selling, mint-flavored electronic cigarettes as it struggles to survive a nationwide backlash against vaping.
The voluntary step comes days after new government research showed that Juul is the top brand among high schoolers who use e-cigarettes and that many prefer mint.
“These results are unacceptable,” said the company’s CEO K.C. Crosthwaite, adding in a statement that the company must “earn the trust of society.”
Underage vaping has reached what health officials call epidemic levels. In the latest government survey, 1 in 4 high school students reported using e-cigarettes in the previous month, despite federal law banning sales to those under 18.
Under fire for its alleged role in sparking the vaping craze among teens, Juul has made a series of concessions to try and weather a crackdown from local, state and federal officials. It stopped selling popular fruit and dessert flavors in stores last year, and last month, stopped selling them online, too.
Alphabet board investigating misconduct cases
In response to shareholder lawsuits, the board at Google parent Alphabet is investigating claims of sexual misconduct made against executives and how the company handled them.
CNBC first reported Wednesday that the company has hired an outside firm to examine how its executives handled sexual misconduct allegations.
The investigation follows lawsuits brought by shareholders after reports of sexual harassment at Google received national attention last year. One lawsuit claims the board played an active part in approving a multimillion severance package to a former executive, even after he had been accused of sexual misconduct and the claims had been found credible.
Thousands of Google employees walked out of work last fall to protest the company’s handling of sexual misconduct claims and payouts. The New York Times last year revealed that Android creator Andy Rubin received $90 million in severance after several employees filed misconduct allegations against him.
Gap CEO steps down amid slumping sales
Gap’s board announced that CEO Art Peck is stepping down as the company continues to struggle to turn around a long-standing sales slump.
The San Francisco-based retailer also said late Thursday that it cut its earnings outlook for the year as sales at the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy fell in the most recent quarter.
Peck, who joined the company in 2005 and became CEO in 2015, will depart from the company after a brief transition. He will also step down from the board.
Effective immediately, Robert J. Fisher, the company’s current non-executive chairman of the board, will serve as president and CEO on an interim basis. Fisher is the son of Gap Inc.’s co-founders Donald and Doris F. Fisher.
Borrowing rises, led by auto, student loans
Consumer borrowing rose in September at a modest pace, driven by more student and auto loans, though a category that mostly includes credit cards fell for the second straight month.
The Federal Reserve said Thursday that overall consumer borrowing increased 2.8% to $4.15 trillion. A category that covers student and auto loans rose 4.2%, while credit card debt fell 1.2%.
Americans are spending at a solid pace but in recent months have relied less on borrowing. Steady, if modest, income growth has enabled consumers to shop more while also stepping up saving. A separate government report last week showed that spending rose in September, but incomes increased more, lifting the savings rate to 8.3%, the highest in six months.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The 'Anonymous' author purporting to be at the top of the Trump administration is soon releasing a book titled "A Warning," a behind the scenes look into the president of Donald Trump.
The author, identified as "a senior official in the Trump administration," according to news reports, first came to prominence with an anonymous op-ed published in September 2018 in The New York Times that described efforts by the author and other senior officials to protect the country from Trump.
The publisher says the anonymous book author did not take an advance payment for the book, and plans to donate a substantial amount of royalties to "non-profit organizations that focus on government accountability and on supporting those who stand up for the truth in repressive countries around the world," a representative of the author, Matt Latimer, told The Washington Post.
The White House publicly condemned the excerpts of the book that have emerged so far.
"The coward who wrote this book didn’t put their name on it because it is nothing but lies," said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
'Anonymous' book: Trump staffers mulled mass resignations, reports say
Here are some of the most explosive claims so far from the book:
Officials thought Pence would support removing Trump
According to an excerpt obtained by HuffPost, senior White House officials did "a back-of-the-envelope tally" of the number of Cabinet members who would support the invocation of the 25th Amendment, which allows for the removal of a president if the majority of the Cabinet and the vice president deem the president unfit for office.
They believed, according to the author, that Pence would support such a move. The discussions allegedly took place after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017.
Pence responded to the claim while speaking with reporters in New Hampshire on Thursday, calling the book "appalling. "
"I never heard anything in my time as Vice President about the 25th amendment. And why would I?" he said, adding that "Those rumors – I dismissed them several years ago and. I’m happy to dismiss them. . . today. "
Karen Pence: Second lady embraces bigger role on 2020 campaign trail
'Midnight self-massacre'
The Washington Post reported that the book plans to discuss how White House officials considered a mass resignation last year as part of a "midnight self-massacre," echoing an incident from the Richard Nixon White House when administration officials refused to carry out Nixon's orders were fired en masse.
The mass resignation was considered in order to draw public attention to Trump's conduct, but the officials decided to remain in office rather than destabilize the U. S. government, the official writes.
The author says op-ed was wrong
The author's September 2018 op-ed in the Times claimed there were White House officials standing between Trump and his worst impulses, and that they could keep the president in check. The Post reports the author admitted to being wrong on this point.
"Many Trump appointees have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump’s more misguided impulses until he is out of office," the author wrote last year.
"I was wrong about the ‘quiet resistance’ inside the Trump administration," the author writes now. "Unelected bureaucrats and cabinet appointees were never going to steer Donald Trump the right direction in the long run, or refine his malignant management style. He is who he is. "
Mitt Romney: A solitary GOP voice battling Trump for the soul of the Republican Party
'Like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower'
According to the Post, the author also plans to criticize Trump's character and whether he's fit for office.
The author describes Trump as “like a twelve-year-old in an air traffic control tower, pushing the buttons of government indiscriminately, indifferent to the planes skidding across the runway and the flights frantically diverting away from the airport" in an excerpt provided to the outlet.
In another excerpt, the author writes, "I am not qualified to diagnose the president’s mental acuity" but adds:
"All I can tell you is that normal people who spend any time with Donald Trump are uncomfortable by what they witness. He stumbles, slurs, gets confused, is easily irritated, and has trouble synthesizing information, not occasionally but with regularity. Those who would claim otherwise are lying to themselves or to the country. "
Bill Barr: Trump wanted Barr to publicly declare Trump broke no laws in Ukraine call
Misogynistic and racist comments
The author alleges Trump makes misogynistic and racist comments, based on excerpts provided to the Post.
"I’ve sat and listened in uncomfortable silence as he talks about a woman’s appearance or performance,” the author says in the excerpts. “He comments on makeup. He makes jokes about weight. He critiques clothing. He questions the toughness of women in and around his orbit. He uses words like ‘sweetie’ and ‘honey’ to address accomplished professionals. This is precisely the way a boss shouldn’t act in the work environment. "
The author also says Trump attempted to put on a Hispanic accent during a meeting about immigration.
"We get these women coming in with like seven children," Trump said, according to the author. "They are saying, 'Oh, please help! My husband left me!' They are useless. They don’t do anything for our country. At least if they came in with a husband we could put him in the fields to pick corn or something. "
George Kent: Top takeaways from Kent's newly released impeachment testimony
Trump fearful of notes
According to the excerpts published by the Post, Trump is particularly fearful of internal White House fights and of notes of meetings.
The Post reports that during one meeting, the president yelled at a staffer who was writing notes.

Unmask the whistleblower: A fair, good faith impeachment of Donald Trump demands it

Texto completo: The mainstream media has assiduously avoided naming the whistleblower behind the complaint about President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. In doing so, they neglect their duty to inform the public on a momentous matter of state.
Following President Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, an anonymous civil servant, later revealed by The New York Times to be a male CIA employee, filed a complaint expressing urgent concern that “the president of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U. S. election. ” This explosive charge, and by extension the person behind it, inspired House Democrats to vote for an official impeachment inquiry, beginning just the fourth earnest attempt to impeach a president in American history.
Impeachment is a political matter. There is no meaningful legal standard for impeaching the president. High crimes and misdemeanors are what Congress says they are. As a result, each legislator makes two decisions: whether impeachment is justified on the merits, and whether impeachment is politically advantageous. Has the president done what the bill of impeachment claims? Does the politician and his or her party stand to gain or lose electorally thanks to impeachment?
The second question is at least as important as the first, and that’s OK. Hem and haw about civic duty from dawn to dusk. Elected officials are just that — elected. Elections make legislators accountable to voters, which is good. Accountability also makes legislators political actors, which we too often treat as a bad thing. It is not. Politics is how we hold the powerful to account.
Even still, the first question matters. The public thinks of a crime as a violation of law. Thus, legislators considering impeaching the president have to ask if the public can be convinced that the president is a scofflaw. This cloaks impeachment, a thoroughly political process, in the rhetoric of legality. The law matters, not because a judge or jury will rule on impeachment, but because the public will evaluate the motives and actions of legislators with reference to the law.
Many legislators will nonetheless act solely out of partisan hatred, political expediency, or some combination thereof. And most of these will suffer no political consequences. Yet some legislators will suffer electorally if they allow partisanship to override the facts in full view of the electorate. Fulsome disclosure will not force legislators to decide impeachment on the merits. However, well-earned political fear can get them to the right answer via a lesser path.
No plausible argument for anonymity
Process and substance both matter. The public must decide if the president should be impeached, but also if the impeachment process is fair and public-spirited. For that to work, legislators must hear testimony in full view of an attentive nation. Attempting to establish facts in the dark increases the likelihood that the public will see impeachment as a partisan exercise.
The Editorial Board: Don't reveal the whistleblower on Donald Trump's phone call with Ukraine
Reenter the press. For citizens to decide if their representatives are acting in good faith, they need to have all of the facts of the case. The public has a right to ask and have answered critical questions of fact and motive, including about the factual basis for impeachment, and the goals and behavior of the whistleblower. If enlightening the public requires unmasking the whistleblower, so be it.
Prior to the House vote, before an impeachment process formally began, plausible arguments for protecting the whistleblower’s identity could be made. Laws exist that protect civil servants who come forward with reports of wrongdoing. Moreover, being thrust into the middle of a public controversy is upsetting, even frightening. The whistleblower is doubtlessly enduring a great deal. I have compassion for that.
However, with the impeachment vote, the House has moved beyond the realm of administrative procedures, and into the rarified air of high politics. This public, political process — based mainly on the whistleblower’s complaint — must necessarily subject the whistleblower’s intentions and behaviors to scrutiny. Put more simply, the whistleblower’s privacy is less important than the public’s need for information now that impeachment is underway.
Bureaucrats need oversight, too
Press outlets arguing to the contrary make themselves ridiculous. The media don't generally argue that administrative rules should override a compelling public interest in information. Keeping secret the moving spirit behind removing an elected official is constitutionally absurd. Whistleblower-protection policies are all good and well, but they are not more important than the public’s ability to decide whether or not one group of elected officials is justified in removing another elected official.
Americans understand fairness: 'Whistleblower' must testify under oath and in person: Rep. Jim Jordan
This is doubly so given the whistleblower has no firsthand knowledge of the Zelensky call. Rather, his complaint compiled the concerns of several officials, none of whom — as far as we know — have issued a whistleblower complaint themselves. When, why, and how the whistleblower undertook this collection may reinforce or call into question the credibility of his complaint. The public deserves to make a judgment on that question. Doing so requires unmasking the whistleblower.
The media’s reticence to date is understandable. If the House had failed to vote to move forward with impeachment, outing the whistleblower would have had a chilling effect on future complaints. Yet now that the vote has passed and the process has begun, powerful people are attempting to unmask and shield the whistleblower for partisan reasons. The media needs to put the facts before the people and let them decide.
The press habitually lionizes the quiet professionalism of our civil service, whether or not that “quiet professional” label fits. They forget that politicians enjoy the democratic imprimatur of having been elected. Unelected bureaucrats do not.
Legislators are accountable to the people. Bureaucrats are not. Politicians prevaricate, equivocate, and disappoint. But they are public persons accountable to the public. Even in our polarized age, the people rightly answer momentous questions of state by selecting decision-makers at the ballot box. The press has a solemn obligation to help inform that selection. By shielding the whistleblower, even after the House vote, the media is neglecting that duty.

Texto completo: "The only thing that will stop me now is myself," Eric Pizer said after getting a pardon from the governor of Wisconsin.
A work crew from a concrete company had spent the mild autumn day repairing cracks in the sidewalks in the small Wisconsin city of Baraboo. Now, on the 60-mile drive home, one of the weary men in the truck checked his cellphone to see if he had any email.
He did. From the Office of the Governor, Tony Evers.
Dear Mr. Pizer:
The Pardon Advisory Board has recommended to the Governor that you receive a pardon for Grant County case number 04CF139. The Governor accepted the Board's recommendation.
Since you are one of the first applicants to be pardoned in Wisconsin in over eight years, Governor Evers would like to invite you to be present as he signs the pardon paperwork on October 7, 2019, at 3 PM. ...
Eric Pizer lowered his phone, exhaled, and said the words he'd waited more than a decade to say:
"I got my pardon."
His co-workers in the truck congratulated him. "Good for you, man," he recalled them saying. "That's awesome."
They drove on. Mr. Pizer gave his girlfriend a quick call, but decided to wait before telephoning his mother. That promised to be a much longer conversation about the consequences of a September night 15 years ago.
One night. One moment. One punch.
Back then Mr. Pizer was a 23-year-old Marine sergeant just two days fresh from his second tour of duty in Iraq, where he had overseen tank and truck fueling in a combat zone. He decided to unwind with a couple of friends and a couple of beers in Boscobel, a small city of 3,200 known as the birthplace of the Gideon Bible.
But his R & R was disrupted by a heated misunderstanding over whether someone -- not Mr. Pizer -- had gotten too friendly with a man's wife. In the shove-and-shout confusion that followed, the out-of-towner Mr. Pizer, 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, threw one punch, breaking the nose of a local resident, Steven Frazier, 5-foot-10 and 140 pounds.
Mr. Frazier was taken to the hospital; Mr. Pizer, into custody.
The Marine finished the last three months of his hitch in North Carolina, and returned to face a felony charge of substantial battery that a county prosecutor, Anthony J. Pozorski Sr., declined to reduce. One minute he'd been a proud Marine; the next, a convicted felon denied certain rights, including ownership or possession of a gun.
Mr. Pizer completed a probation sentence, made financial restitution and went on with life. He married, fathered a son, divorced. He worked as a laborer, a landscaper, a piano mover, anything that paid the bills.
After a few years, he asked Mr. Pozorski to consider reducing the conviction to a misdemeanor, but the prosecutor again declined. Interested now in becoming a police officer -- which would require him to carry a gun -- Mr. Pizer embraced the motto of his state: "Forward." He earned an associate degree in criminal justice and -- with the help of two Madison lawyers, David D. Relles and John R. Zwieg -- prepared an application for a pardon.
He reached out to his victim, Mr. Frazier, but received no response. "I wasn't quite ready," Mr. Frazier later recalled.
Then, in 2014, in a moment arranged by a restorative-justice organization and later described by a This Land column in The New York Times, the two men met at Boscobel's community center. Mr. Pizer apologized. Mr. Frazier explained that his damaged nose had to be reset twice, that the injury had altered his looks and breathing, and that he often suffered from migraines.
Still, the victim forgave his assailant. They shook hands.
But the timing was exquisitely bad to be seeking a pardon in Wisconsin. The governor, a Republican with presidential aspirations named Scott Walker, had decided not to grant any pardons at all, even though previous governors had routinely exercised this constitutional power to forgive.
From January 2011 until January 2019, then, Wisconsin was the state that refused to pardon.
Mr. Pizer had no hope of a pardon. That is, until Governor Walker, whose candidacy for president lasted two months in 2015, lost his seat in 2018 to a Democrat, Tony Evers, who believed in the grace of pardons.
Mr. Pizer, now 38 and working for a concrete company, sought official forgiveness once again. With the help of his lawyers, he filled out the detailed application and included several letters of recommendation. The sentencing judge supported the request, but the prosecutor opposed it, arguing that the applicant was trying to rewrite history.
In late September, Mr. Pizer presented his case to the recently resurrected Pardon Advisory Board at the State Capitol in Madison. He wore his black suit, his only suit, and struggled to steady his nerves. Reading his prepared statement, he briefly wept, but recovered.
He said that he wanted to apologize, again, to his victim, Mr. Frazier. That he had taken responsibility for his actions, paid the many consequences and been a good citizen -- "other than the one incident for which I seek your forgiveness." That he'd always wanted to work in law enforcement, and a pardon would allow him to pursue that dream.
"It would allow me to reclaim my good name," he said. "It would allow me to start over."
Mr. Pizer returned to wearing Walmart jeans, work boots and a company T-shirt. He patched more sidewalk cracks while waiting to hear whether the state would patch this crack in his past.
Then came the email.
On a recent Monday afternoon, Mr. Pizer put on his suit again and returned to the State Capitol. Joining him were several people, including his mother and her husband, his girlfriend and his lawyers. They were led into the quiet of the governor's office.
"It was closed to the press," Mr. Relles, one of Mr. Pizer's lawyers, recalled. "And apolitical."
The governor asked the anxious petitioner a few general questions, and thanked him for this opportunity. Then he signed the proclamation of pardon and posed for photographs.
"Sounds corny, but it feels amazing," Mr. Pizer later said. "I have all my freedoms back. The only thing that will stop me now is myself."
The ceremony of justice and mercy ended with more handshakes, and a new Eric Pizer walked forward into the fresh autumn air.

Texto completo: Watching the World War II drama "Midway" this week, I found myself wondering what Martin Scorsese would call it.
Spectacular, stirring and sometimes predictably formulaic, action director Roland Emmerich's dramatization of the pivotal naval battle between U.S. and Japanese forces is Hollywood potted history at its slickest and most rousing, a serious and worthy subject packaged for maximum entertainment value. But is it art?
More to the point: Does it want to be?
Scorsese's own version of "Is it art?" has been all over the news lately, first in an interview accusing Marvel comic-book movies of being closer to theme parks than true cinema, then doubling and tripling down, most recently by way of a New York Times op-ed in which he sought to clarify his position and champion the daring, emotionally high-stakes movies he likes to watch and seeks to make.
"For me, for the filmmakers I came to love and respect, for my friends who started making movies around the same time that I did, cinema was about revelation," he wrote. "It was about confronting the unexpected on the screen and in the life it dramatized and interpreted, and enlarging the sense of what was possible in the art form. And that was the key for us: it was an art form ."
Now on the cusp of turning 77, Scorsese is part of a generation that came of age during the postwar cinematic boom, when films from Europe, Asia and the American avant-garde met receptive audiences, many of them college-educated thanks to the G.I. Bill. Tutored both in schools and in art-house theaters, some of these fans became filmmakers themselves, taking their aesthetic tastes to the New Hollywood, where movies like "Bonnie and Clyde," "Easy Rider" and "The Graduate" defined the sensibility of a generation.
For Scorsese and his peers - Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola - cinema was an art form, and it has continued to evolve as such. But it has also evolved as an industrial practice and mass entertainment. Virtually since the medium's inception, American cinema has been a three-legged stool, propped up by artistic creativity, highly rationalized production and distribution, and broad-based commercial appeal.
Sometimes, those values are hopelessly at odds. Sometimes they come together in surprising and delightful ways. And sometimes even the most felicitous convergences result in a cascade of unintended consequences. For every masterpiece like Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" - which was not just aesthetically groundbreaking but also became a box office hit - there's been a "Jaws," Spielberg's masterfully constructed thriller that was one of the gateway drugs to Hollywood's current addiction to blockbusters, sequels and franchise pictures.

It's possible to feel a little whipsawed by the argument that Scorsese has ignited. On one hand, it's admittedly gratifying to see rabid comic-book fans, whose tastes have so thoroughly colonized movie culture, be reminded that their obsessions aren't always as meaningful or aesthetically amazing as they've been led to believe (despite being shamelessly pandered to by studios and endless ComicCons). For too long, the press - yes, including critics - has been prone to grade the Comic Book Industrial Complex on a curve, hungry for clicks, cowed by the genre's popularity with readers and worn out by hyper-defensive fans. It's refreshing to witness an otherwise invincible cultural cohort get a reality check about film's humanist fundamentals from a respected elder.
On the other hand, as films from "Batman Begins" to "Black Panther" have proved, those fundamentals can often be expressed in comic-book movies with vision, artistry and genuine emotion. And Scorsese himself could stand accused of committing his own version of the sins he sees in Marvel movies.
His new film, "The Irishman," is just as much an exercise in satisfying "a specific set of demands" - his term for fan service - as "Avengers: Endgame," with Scorsese reuniting his cherished band of actors-cum-antiheroes ("Goodfellas, assemble!"), engaging in ritualized tropes of convulsive violence and tough-guy patois, going on at self-indulgent length, and even using expensive special effects (in this case, de-aging Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino through a process that brought the budget to nearly $160 million).
Coincidentally, Scorsese has remained noncommittal when asked about the DC Comics-inspired origin story "Joker," which he once considered directing himself, and which owes many of its signature visual and thematic references to his own classics, most notably "Taxi Driver" and "The King of Comedy." "Joker," which won the Golden Lion at this year's Venice Film Festival, is now poised to break $1 billion at the worldwide box office and to earn at least a few Oscar nominations, including for lead actor Joaquin Phoenix.
Is "Joker" art? Is it entertainment? Is it Hollywood product?
Why can't it be all three?
That question is particularly germane during awards season, when filmgoers can see movies that aspire to be smart, stylish, human-scale and audience-friendly. While edgy indies like "Uncut Gems" and "Waves" push cinematic grammar to its edges, movies like "Ford v. Ferrari," "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood" and "The Two Popes" prove that mainstream and artfulness aren't mutually exclusive. Scorsese's own "Irishman" is part of the Oscar economy, with Netflix (the only studio willing to underwrite its expensive production and marketing budget) leveraging the awards campaign to drive subscribers to its site.
Although filmgoers lucky enough to live in select markets will be able to see "The Irishman" on the big screen when it goes wide over the next two weeks, many others will need to wait until Nov. 27 to see it at home - a disappointment to die-hard purists, no doubt, but also a concession to how movies are being consumed in the 21st century. Although every year has its surprise hits, for the most part filmgoers reserve their moviegoing dollars for films they feel they must see in theaters to get the full experience, whether that means special-effects extravaganzas, cartoons the whole family can enjoy, horror flicks with gotta-be-there jump scares or laugh-along comedies. This is truer than ever in an increasingly globalized industry, in which simplistic spectacles are the easiest export of all.
When Scorsese bemoans the Marvel monoculture, what many of us hear is a dirge for the kind of midrange, character-driven stories that more viewers are enjoying at home, and not just because they don't have an art house in their neighborhood. Why leave the comfort of our theater-like home entertainment systems for actual theaters, especially when the kind of "risk" that Scorsese extols may not be worth the cost of parking, tickets and snacks (not to mention the prospect of sticky floors, loud talking and incessant texting)?
Still, there are filmgoers - not just teenagers, parents of toddlers or superhero fans - who would like to see a movie once in a while in an old-fashioned bricks-and-mortar theater. That's Scorsese's tribe, and their core anxiety isn't that Marvel movies are being legitimized, but that there may soon come a day when there will be nothing to see on screen except a bombastic blur of Spandex and CGI. Now that Disney has bought Twentieth Century Fox to become the industry's biggest studio (and profit center), those fears are more justified than ever.
I share those misgivings. But nearly every year I see reason for optimism.
This year, it came in the form of movies like "The Farewell," "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood," "The Peanut Butter Falcon" and "Parasite" - all of which have found healthy audiences and proved yet again that there are profitable markets across a wide range of stories, styles and sensibilities. As art, entertainment and commercial successes, they prove that the three-legged stool is still the sturdiest kind. Focus on one leg at the expense of the others, and you cut the entire medium off at the knees.

Alphabet’s board investigating how it handles sexual misconduct claims against executives

Texto completo: Alphabet's board of directors is investigating how executives have dealt with allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct, including those leveled against the company's top lawyer.
The Google parent has hired a law firm and formed a special subcommittee to investigate these issues, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak on the record. Alphabet is facing lawsuits alleging it failed shareholders by approving lucrative exit packages for executives despite credible claims of misconduct.
"As has already been confirmed in public court filings, in early 2019, Alphabet's Board of Directors formed a special litigation committee to consider claims made by shareholders in various lawsuits relating to past workplace conduct," Alphabet said in a statement to The Washington Post. CNBC first reported the news Thursday.
Allegations that Alphabet suppressed claims of misconduct prompted walkouts worldwide last year by more than 20,000 Google employees. They blasted the company's "culture of complicity, dismissiveness, and support for perpetrators" following a New York Times report that it sent Android creator Andy Rubin off with a $90 million exit package in 2014 after - and without disclosing - credible allegations of sexual misconduct had emerged. Rubin denied the report in a Twitter post, saying it was "part of a smear campaign" tied to a divorce and custody battle.
After the walkouts, Google CEO Sundar Pichai notified employees that 48 people had been fired during a two-year span over sexual harassment or misconduct allegations, including 13 senior managers. "None of these individuals received an exit package," he wrote in the memo. Weeks later, Google said it would make several changes requested by employees, including putting an end to forced arbitration and increasing its transparency on reported incidents of sexual misconduct.
The employee backlash occurred as the company - and the broader tech industry - has come under heightened public scrutiny for its workplace culture, which is predominantly white and male. But Alphabet's review also comes as corporations are increasingly having to answer for executives' personal lapses or misconduct in the #MeToo era. That has led to a rash of C-level departures, including at Intel, REI and, just last week, McDonald's.
Alphabet's lawyers are investigating claims against Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, who has been accused of having relationships with several employees, which is discouraged under company policy.
A former Google legal employee, Jennifer Blakely, published a Medium post in August claiming she and Drummond had an extramarital affair for several years and now have a child. She claimed he abandoned them both, refusing to discuss child support, and later had relationships with other employees at the company.
"Other than Jennifer, I never started a relationship with anyone else who was working at Google or Alphabet. Any suggestion otherwise is simply untrue," Drummond said in a statement to BuzzFeed in August.
Drummond married another employee, who was not in his chain of command, over Labor Day weekend, CNBC reported.
Relationships between executives and subordinates have come under increased scrutiny, even when consensual, leading many companies to implement policies to address them. On Friday, McDonald's fired chief executive Steve Easterbrook for violating a company policy that prohibits managers from having romantic relationships with subordinates.
Easterbrook's separation agreement bars him from working for such competitors as Burger King, Yum Brands and Starbucks, as well as convenience store giants such as 7-Eleven and Wawa, for the next two years. But his exit was sweetened by a severance package that Equilar analysts say is worth as much as $42 million.
In February, the chief executive of outdoor apparel and gear retailer REI, Jerry Stritzke, resigned after a board investigation determined he failed to disclose a relationship with "the leader of another organization in the outdoor industry." Board chairman Steve Hooper told employees that the "perceived conflict of interest" should have been disclosed under company policy.
Last year, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stepped down after an investigation showed he had a consensual relationship with an employee in violation of the chipmaker's non-fraternization policy. His exit followed high-profile departures at Lululemon, Priceline, Best Buy and Pixar over workplace romances or misconduct.

Texto completo: Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is preparing to jump into the 2020 Democratic primary for president.
Bloomberg, 77, a billionaire, has mulled over a presidential bid for months, according to the New York Times. Bloomberg has publicly downplayed and, at times, outright denied that he would enter the race for 2020.
Bloomberg still has not yet made a decision on whether to jump into the crowded Democratic primary field, but he is expected to file paperwork in at least one state, Alabama, designating him a contender in the primary. He has hired staff and sent them to Alabama to collect enough signatures to qualify for a run. The deadline to file paperwork for a presidential run in Alabama is Nov. 8.
"We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated — but Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that," said Howard Wolfson, a Bloomberg adviser. "If Mike runs, he would offer a new choice to Democrats built on a unique record running America's biggest city, building a business from scratch and taking on some of America’s toughest challenges as a high-impact philanthropist."

If Bloomberg jumps in, he would likely rely on his wealth to compete with candidates that have been campaigning for months and set up large campaign operations in key states. Bloomberg would follow fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, who jumped into the race in July and burned through large amounts of his own cash to qualify for the Democratic debate stage.

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton said that "Medicare for all" won't be passed into law.
“You just don't think that that plan would ever get enacted?” interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Clinton at a New York Times conference Thursday.
“No, I don't. I don't,” she said. “But the goal is the right goal.”
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont back "Medicare for all," a plan to enroll everyone in the United States into a government healthcare plan and ban private health insurance. Clinton said she favored a plan along the lines of those proposed by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Joe Biden that would allow the public to keep their private plans or buy into a government plan.
“I believe the smarter approach is to build on what we have. A public option is something I've been in favor of for a very long time,” the former secretary of state and 2016 presidential candidate said. “I don't believe we should be in the midst of a big disruption while we are trying to get to 100% coverage and deal with costs.”
“If you look at our major competitors, a lot of them have mixed systems and produce very good outcomes, like Switzerland, Germany, et cetera,” she said.
Clinton said she will support whichever Democrat wins the nomination and hinted that she knew “who it is likely to be … But I’m not going to go there.”

Texto completo: El exalcalde de la ciudad de Nueva York, Michael Bloomberg, entre a competir a las primarias demócratas de 2020 en Alabama , según han hecho público varios medios este jueves.
El multimillonario neoyorquino dijo en mayo que descartaba concurrir a las elecciones presidenciales de 2020 pero The New York Times lanzó recientemente que Bloomberg lleva semanas sopesando su posible candidatura. Aunque el diario dejó claro que el exalcalde no ha tomado una decisión final, un vocero suyo le dijo a CNN este jueves que “es de esperar” que el hombre se presente a las primarias de Alabama.
De acuerdo al Times, un equipo de Bloomberg se ha dirigido a Alabama para recoger allí las firmas necesarias para las primarias . Aunque las primarias de Alabama no es una de las primeras, la fecha límite que tiene el candidato para presentarse es, según el diario neoyorquino, este viernes.

Texas poll shows Trump ahead of every Democrat

Texto completo: President Donald Trump holds a lead over every Democratic candidate if the election were held in Texas today, according to a new University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll.
The internet survey of 1,200 registered Texas voters, which was conducted Oct. 18-27, seems to indicate that the eventual Democratic nominee will have a lot of work to do in the Lone Star State.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are both 7 percentage points behind Trump. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont trails Trump by 5 percentage points. Former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, who dropped out of the race on Friday, lags behind the president by 6 percentage points. Julián Castro, former U.S. housing secretary and mayor of San Antonio, would lose to Trump by 13 percentage points.
The margin of error is plus or minus 2.83 percentage points.
The numbers are a shift from previous surveys that found much tighter contests.
A Quinnipiac University poll of Texas voters in June found Biden with a slight lead over Trump among Texans, 48% to 44%. It showed Trump enjoying narrow margins over other candidates.
And polling in April from Emerson College found that Biden, Warren, Sanders and O’Rourke were in a statistical dead heat with Trump.
But James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas, said voters often are wedded to one candidate at this stage of an election cycle,which affects responses to hypothetical matchups involving multiple Democratic candidates. Support for a candidate historically coalesces once that candidate seems assured of winning the nomination.
“This is a year out, and the situation a year out is not going to be much of a predictor of what this campaign is going to look like when you get to a general election,” Henson said.
Biden leads Democrats
Despite Trump’s lead over each candidate, a slight majority of Texas voters say they would vote for someone else rather than reelect Trump. Forty-eight percent of Texas voters said they are likely to vote for Trump, while 52% said they are unlikely to reelect him.
If the Texas Democratic primary were held today, Biden would win the most delegates, with 23% support, compared to Warren’s 18%, O’Rourke’s 14% and Sanders’ 12%.
Democrats are targeting 22 GOP-held state House districts and six GOP-controlled U.S. House districts in Texas and say that this year could be their chance to turn the state blue. Trump’s margin of victory in Texas against Democrat Hillary Clinton was 9 percentage points, making it the closest presidential contest in the state since 1996.
The UT/Texas Tribune poll found that Texans are split when it comes to U.S. House races, where 43% of voters say they’ll vote Republican and 43% say they’ll vote Democratic.
In an email Monday, Texas Democrats pointed to earlier polling that shows good news for Democrats.
“Poll after poll shows the same result: This election is razor-thin,” Manny Garcia, Texas Democratic Party executive director, said in a statement. “Republicans are scared. We can’t let up. Texas Democrats must keep organizing.”
Senate race
Meanwhile, name recognition is still an issue in the race for U.S. Senate, according to the UT/Texas Tribune poll. It surveyed voters’ knowledge of Democratic candidates running to unseat U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.
MJ Hegar, a former combat helicopter pilot, leads the pack if the election were held today, but with just 12% support.
Just 24% of voters said they’ve heard of Chris Bell, a former congressman who ran for governor in 2006. Slightly more than 1 in 5 voters said they’d heard of state Sen. Royce West of Dallas. Hegar, who last year came within 3 points of defeating U.S. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, is known to 20% of voters. Other candidates in the Democratic Senate race are lesser known. The results could leave room for a better-known candidate to enter the race. The filing deadline is Dec. 9.
Castro, who is mired in the low-single digits nationally and in early nominating states, has said he wouldn’t join the Senate race even if he dropped out of the presidential race. Cornyn’s campaign warned supporters that O’Rourke, who lost to U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, by 2.6 percentage points last year, is prepping for a run against Cornyn. Throughout his presidential campaign, however, O’Rourke has said he would not run for Senate. O’Rourke spokesman Rob Friedlander reiterated that stance on Friday.
“Beto will not be a candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas in 2020,” Friedlander told The New York Times.

Kansas City Votes to Strip King's Name From Avenue

Texto completo: After contentious debate, the Missouri city christened a street after the civil rights leader this year. Residents decided to revert it to Paseo Boulevard.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Voters decided on Tuesday to strip the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s name from a street in Kansas City, Mo., nine months after city leaders dedicated a major thoroughfare to the civil rights leader.
The decision caps more than a year and a half of contentious debate over how to honor Dr. King. It once again makes Kansas City the rare major American city without a street named for him.
"Shameful day for Kansas City," said the Rev. Dr. Vernon P. Howard Jr., president of the city's chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization that Dr. King founded.
The vote, he added, "set us decades back in the march toward racial justice and racial inclusion."
But those who wanted the street returned to its former name, Paseo Boulevard, heralded the result as a win for a black community that they say was ignored when the decision to change the name to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard was first made.
"Dr. King's dream is real," said Alissia Canady, a black former councilwoman who opposed naming the street for Dr. King. "And black voters won't allow anybody, black or otherwise, to disenfranchise them in Kansas City."
About 65 percent of voters decided they preferred the name Paseo Boulevard, according to unofficial election results released by the city.
The monthslong battle had incited an unlikely political battle in which black people for and against keeping Dr. King's name on the street claimed they were on the side of racial justice.
Dr. Howard's organization had led a petition drive last year to get a ballot measure allowing voters to choose whether to rename Paseo Boulevard after Dr. King. That drive failed, but the city's elected officials stepped in and voted, 8-4, to change the name anyway. In the process, the Council did not adhere to an ordinance requiring most of a street's residents to approve a renaming.
That amounted to "prominent African-American leaders disenfranchising black property owners and voters," Ms. Canady said.
"I will find it hard to believe if these were white property owners, the Council would have voted against their will," she added.
Ms. Canady and others say they are not against naming a street after Dr. King. They just do not think it should be Paseo Boulevard, which is also known as the Paseo. Ms. Canady's former district included portions of the boulevard. Most of the residents she spoke with in the majority-black area did not want the street name changed, she said.
The Paseo was named after Paseo de la Reforma, a grand thoroughfare in Mexico City. The name might be unfamiliar to most Americans, but in Kansas City it has become synonymous with black success, Ms. Canady said.
Dotted with mansions, pergolas and columns, the Paseo provided a stable place for striving black families to live when their options were limited by legalized segregation through the mid-1900s.
"There is pride of having a home along the Paseo," she said.
Supporters for keeping Dr. King's name on the boulevard say the Paseo's prominence makes it a good place to honor him.
When the question of naming a street for Dr. King was debated last year, many wondered whether it was best to choose a street in a mostly black or mostly white neighborhood. Kansas City, like many other urban centers in America, remains deeply segregated. African-Americans mostly live to the east of Troost Avenue.
Streets bearing Dr. King's name tend to be in lower-income areas with predominantly black populations. Derek H. Alderman, a professor of geography at the University of Tennessee, has documented at least 955 streets in America named for the civil rights icon. King streets often end up in struggling communities because white, affluent areas put up stiff resistance, Dr. Alderman said.
The effort to overturn the city's decision and restore the name to Paseo Boulevard started this year. A group called Save the Paseo began gathering signatures to put the issue on the November ballot. The group got more than 2,800 signatures, leading to Tuesday's vote.
Dr. Howard and other black clergy and civic leaders, including Representative Emanuel Cleaver II, led the effort to keep King Boulevard. Dr. Howard accused white residents of leading the opposition.
"This is white-led, trying to dictate to the African-American community who it honors, where they're honored, how they're honored," he said. "We believe that is systemic and structural racism."
Two white women led Save the Paseo's early efforts. But many black residents joined the coalition. While Dr. Howard acknowledged that African-Americans were also part of the Save the Paseo group, he said it was far from a black grass-roots movement.
"Certainly there are segments of the African-American community who are less concerned about issues of racial justice," he said.
Some black residents disputed that characterization.
Kellie Jones, who has lived on what was the Paseo for 10 years, said that after the Council voted to change the name, her neighbors overwhelmingly said they opposed the renaming. Ms. Jones has since become one of the leading activists for Save the Paseo.
"I know who I work with," she said. "It's black and brown people, it's disenfranchised people and it's people who feel like they do not have a voice."
Ms. Jones emphasized that she and other members of the group were not opposed to naming a street after Dr. King and that their opposition was concerned with how the renaming was done -- without enough public input. But they also said they felt that there were better ways to honor Dr. King, and that the Paseo had too much history associated with it to be changed.
"I don't like to rewrite history," said Diane Euston, who is white and a leader of Save the Paseo.

Texto completo: Last month, the International Monetary Fund declared that "carbon taxes," levied on suppliers of fossil fuels whose carbon dioxide emissions are driving the Earth's rapid warming, are "the most powerful and efficient" way to save humanity from the impending climate crisis.
The next day, however, North Bay Congressman Jared Huffman told a large crowd in San Rafael, "there was a time when a lot of people wanted to believe that if we  just set a carbon tax or did a carbon fee, the market would take care of this climate problem  I do not believe that. If you look at places that have done that,  carbon pricing may be doing some good things, but it's not the main driver of greenhouse gas reductions."
He's right about the past, but we must now look forward, as time is fast running out to deploy effective global solutions. When Congress finally addresses climate legislation, robust carbon taxes must accompany traditional regulations as a primary policy for harnessing the power of market incentives to drive down greenhouse gas emissions.
More than 3,550 economists have asserted that "A carbon tax offers the most cost-effective lever to reduce carbon emissions at the scale and speed that is necessary." Joining them were 27 Nobel laureates, along with former chairs of the Federal Reserve Board and Council of Economic Advisers from both parties.
Their profession's support for this solution is matched only by the consensus among climate scientists that humans are causing global warming by burning fossil fuels.
Rep. Huffman's skepticism is understandable. Many places that tax fossil fuels have little to show for them because the taxes are very low or riddled with exceptions. However, countries with more robust programs have seen dramatic benefits:
 A 2013 carbon tax introduced in the U.K. slashed electricity generation from coal by 80% in just four years, helping to dial back carbon emissions to 1890 levels.
 A modest carbon tax in British Columbia, rolled out in 2008, cut per capita emissions of carbon dioxide by as much as 15%.
 After Germany increased its carbon price in early 2018, greenhouse emissions from its power sector fell about 20%, and by 2020 are projected to be a third less than in 1990.
 Sweden has cut overall carbon dioxide emissions by a remarkable 25% since it pioneered a carbon tax in 1991, while enjoying GDP growth of nearly 80%. Today this rich country emits only a quarter as much carbon dioxide per dollar of the gross domestic product as the United States.
Columbia University energy expert Noah Kaufman notes, "In the few jurisdictions around the world that have climate policy success stories, carbon pricing has played a prominent role."
The California Legislature and Marin Board of Supervisors have strongly endorsed imposing fees on fossil fuel producers and returning the revenues to the public. So have 68 co-sponsors of the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act in the House of Representatives. So, too, has Sen. Diane Feinstein, co-author of another carbon tax bill in the Senate.
Experts at Resources for the Future and other research institutes estimate that these bills would slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions nearly in half within a decade, while protecting low- and moderate-income families from economic dislocation.
Congressman Huffman will have a chance to review the evidence as a member of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Despite his reservations, he told the recent town hall meeting, "I think carbon pricing can and should be part of a comprehensive climate response. I hope we'll get a chance to do that in the next Congress."
Let's all join him in that hope and urge him to help make it happen.

Texto completo: Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez sought to quell the fears of some Democrats that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard could launch an independent or third-party bid in the 2020 presidential race.
Perez said Wednesday that he spoke with Gabbard and the other 2020 campaigns last week, and that each remained committed to honoring their pledge to only run for president as a Democrat in the 2020 cycle.
“We’ve worked with every campaign including the Gabbard campaign and she’s told us, and she’s told the American people, 'I am not running as a third party candidate,'" Perez said. "We asked every candidate to take that pledge ... Tulsi took it enthusiastically ... she took an unequivocal pledge in that regard,” Perez said, according to The Hill.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the 2016 Democratic nominee, suggested last month that Republicans believe Gabbard could be persuaded to run as a third-party candidate, which could benefit Trump in the general election.
“They are also going to do third-party again, and I’m not making any predictions but I think they got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,” Clinton said.
Clinton also alleged Gabbard was “a favorite of the Russians.”
Gabbard, 38, said in October she would not seek reelection for her House seat in Hawaii and was fully committed to her presidential campaign. She held public office as a Hawaii state representative from 2002 to 2004, and was a Honolulu city councilwoman from 2011 to 2012, when she was elected to Congress.
She has repeatedly said she would not run for president as an independent or third-party candidate and would support the eventual Democratic presidential nominee.

Texto completo: El hijo mayor del presidente Donald Trump, tuiteó este miércoles el supuesto nombre del denunciante anónimo que reveló las presiones de su padre sobre Ucrania . La información que compartió Trump Jr. no ha sido corroborada y solo la han compartido pequeñas páginas web vinculadas a la extrema derecha.
La presunta identidad de quien reveló la información que desató el inicio del proceso para el juicio político al mandatario lleva semanas dando vueltas por la red . El propio mandatario ha pedido abiertamente a la prensa que revele el nombre, algo que va en contra de la leyes de protección al denunciante.
En su tuit, Trump Jr. enlazó un artículo de una publicación que sugería que el denunciante apoya a los demócratas y no a su padre. “ No hay denunciante. Hay alguien con intenciones ocultas contra Trump “, tuiteó el presidente el lunes.
Ese mismo día por la noche, en un acto en Kentucky, Trump y el senador republicano Rand Paul instaron a los medios a publicar la identidad del informante. “Nosotros también sabemos ahora el nombre del denunciante. Le dije esta noche a los medios: ‘hagan su trabajo y publiquen su nombre'” . Hasta ahora, según publicó The New York Times, solo se sabe que es un hombre que trabaja como agente de la CIA . The Times también adelantó que dicho agente tenía un amplio conocimiento de la política ucraniana .
La primera que publicó el supuesto nombre aseguró que su identidad había sido un secreto a voces en Washington. Andrew Bakaj, uno de los abogados del informante, no confirmó ni negó el nombre revelado a la agencia AFP y en un comunicado público dijo que “identificar cualquier nombre con el denunciante solo pondría en riesgo a esa persona y a su familia”.
Trump Jr. se ha desmarcado de los comentarios que le acusan de revelar una información que puede poner en peligro la vida del denunciante. El hijo del presidente se lava las manos asegurando que el nombre era público desde hace semanas.
The entire media is #Triggered that I (a private citizen) tweeted out a story naming the alleged whistleblower. Are they going to pretend that his name hasn’t been in the public domain for weeks now? Numerous people & news outlets including Real Clear Politics already ID’d him. https://t.co/bcamyTaXP3

Texto completo: William McKenna Ryan, 79, of Mansfield Center, CT, passed away on Tuesday, October 29th, 2019, after a long battle with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. He was surrounded by family members. He is survived by his beloved wife of 55 years, Bonnie Forgeron Ryan; his loving daughter, Kathleen Ryan-Gidman and her husband Matthew Gidman of Willington, CT, and their daughter, Madeleine; his loving son, James Ryan, and his wife, Elizabeth, of Greenville, SC, and their two children, Andrew and Ashley. Bill leaves behind a remarkable legacy of dedication to family, friends, and community. He was a paragon of striving to leave things "better than he'd found them."
Born in Oceanside, NY, on October 11th, 1940, the only child of Stephen and Marie McKenna Ryan, Bill spent his formative years in Baldwin, NY. A consummate scholar-athlete, Bill was talented, smart, gregarious, fun-loving, and funny. While at Baldwin High School, Bill distinguished himself as the class of 1958's Valedictorian and starred on the school's Baseball, Soccer, and Bowling teams, ultimately Captaining the Baseball and Bowling teams. After his all-County performance for the baseball team during his Senior year, Bill was drafted by the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies as a "bonus baby." However, recognizing the importance of education, Bill instead opted for a collegiate path.
Bill matriculated to Williams College in Williamstown, MA, in the fall of 1958, commencing a lifelong love affair with the Purple Valley and all things "Eph." While at Williams, Bill continued to pursue both academics and athletics with equal vigor, graduating cum laude with Honors in Physics, excelling in Baseball, and Captaining the Soccer team. It was his catcher's crouch that earned him the moniker of "Buddha," a nickname that followed him throughout his adult life. Bill's greatest joy and enduring passion, however, were the connections he forged with the institution and its people. Bill served the college for decades in various volunteer capacities, including President of the Society of Alumni and Secretary for the Class of 1962. He looked forward to reunions, the Alumni Golf Tournament, and any opportunity to gather with classmates. In fact, Bill took it upon himself to spend the years prior to his 50-Year Reunion to interview in person over 161 '62 alumni; his ventures constituted "a herculean odyssey - crisscrossing the continent, collecting, categorizing, and chronicling the activities" of classmates, as one peer recounted.
After college graduation, Bill proceeded to Cambridge, MA, where he enrolled at the Sloan School at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, earning his M.S. in Industrial Management in 1964. In the summer of that year, Bill married Bonnie, and the two moved to Columbus, OH, where Bill began his career at a technology firm called Industrial Nucleonics. Kathy and Jim were born in Columbus, and in 1972, the family briefly relocated to Kansas City, KS, where Bill had been hired at Standard Havens. In the summer of 1973, Bill and Bonnie returned to the East Coast with their family, finding a home in Mansfield, CT, close to Bill's new job at Brand-Rex, a cable manufacturer. Following Brand-Rex, Bill's industry leadership roles took him to several companies in the area, including Carolyn Chemical, Superwinch, and Aeonics Systems.
In 1993, Bill shifted his talents from the boardroom to the classroom, beginning a teaching career through Connecticut's Alternate Route to Certification (ARC). Over the next decade, Bill taught math at Weaver High School in Hartford, CT, and Bennett Middle School in Manchester, CT. He was hailed for his commitment to his students and passion for the profession. After his retirement in 2004, Bill remained engaged with ARC for several years as an instructor of future math educators.
During his 46 years as a Mansfield resident, Bill made a profound impact on the community. His civic involvement included service on the Economic Development Commission and the Zoning Board of Appeals. In 2005, Bill was elected to the Region 19 Board of Education. He served for four years before being elected to the Mansfield Town Council. During his tenure on the Council, he chaired the Finance Committee and was appointed Deputy Mayor. Bill also generously shared his time and leadership skills with multiple philanthropic organizations, including Perception House, the Covenant Soup Kitchen, and the St. Thomas Aquinas Roundtable. He played violin in the Mansfield Community Orchestra and coached youth soccer, baseball, and basketball teams, serving as President of the Mansfield Junior Soccer Association for five years. A model citizen to the end, Bill cast an absentee ballot as his last conscious act.
Bill had no shortage of avocations. He enjoyed sports, including jogging, golf, tennis, bowling, soccer, and hiking local trails. He was proud of his 11-year running streak, even when it involved miles in sub-zero temperatures or laps around airports and hotel lobbies. His competitive nature manifested itself in lively board games, not least of which was a years-long Pictionary rivalry along gender lines. Bill was inquisitive and curious, fond of reading, classical music, cultural events, trying new restaurants, the New York Times crossword puzzle, and world travel. Though he'd journeyed to over 50 countries, Bill's most-relished sojourns were in Puerto Rico and the Massachusetts hamlets of Williamstown and Chatham.
Bill's greatest love was, however, people. An only child, Bill treasured his family and cultivated his numerous friendships, some reaching back as far as grade school. Bill's loyal, nonjudgmental attitude drew him to appreciate companions and colleagues from all walks of life. Playful and self-effacing, Bill eagerly engaged in his children's and grandchildren's endeavors. He never missed a concert or game if he could help it, even participating in activities when possible, whether that meant catching fly balls or flies for a science project, cuddling his pets and grandpets (including the ones he was allergic to), and donning his best Nutcracker duds, complete with too-tight makeshift eye patch. He and Bonnie were life partners in every sense, even musically, often duetting on piano and violin. At any party or wedding, he could be counted on to hit the dance floor and twist the night away to the tunes of Chubby Checker. Bill's Santa costume made 49 appearances in the annual Ryan Christmas photo.
A local memorial celebration of life is planned for January 12th, 2020, at the UConn Alumni Center, from 11:00 to 2:00. All are welcome. Please feel free to share happy memories or humorous anecdotes.
The Ryan family would like to thank everyone at Mansfield Center for Nursing and Rehabilitation for their respectful, gentle care, encouragement, and support.
Online condolences may be sent to the Potter Funeral Home in Willimantic at potterfuneralhome.com. Donations in Bill's memory may be made to Covenant Soup Kitchen (220 Valley St., Willimantic, CT 06226), Mansfield Community Center (c/o Mansfield Parks and Recreation, 4 South Eagleville Rd., Storrs, CT 06268), or E.O. Smith Foundation (P.O. Box 39, Storrs, CT 06268).
This is a paid death notice.

It's no reason to go boom, baby

Texto completo: You OK, boomer?
After all those anti-establishment placards and slogans, the years of controlling the vernacular and riding herd on the culture, it's tough to be reduced to a catchphrase. Sent your way, you might add, by people "discovering" corduroy hip huggers and bong collections.
I mean, you made youth culture a thing, your thing, and now look what's happened. You, mercifully, did not die before you got old, which means you got old. And despite your insistence that 70 is the new 30, 30 is not the new 10 and 20-year-olds still exist. Which means that, on top of all the knee problems and hip problems and weed getting legalized with no one thanking you for it even though you basically invented weed , you have to deal with a bunch of whippersnappers throwing "OK, boomer" shade on sweatshirts and TikTok.

Not that you're 100% sure what TikTok is and why can't everyone just stay on Twitter and Facebook? You at least understand Twitter and Facebook. That's probably where you read about the conservative radio host saying "boomer" was the age equivalent of the "n-word" (which, well, words fail me) and that's where you went to express your own outrage over getting dissed by a bunch of kids who never had to walk nine miles through snow just to protest the Vietnam War.
In fact, you probably had no idea the phrase "OK boomer" was being slung around in memes and gifs on various platforms that are not Twitter and Facebook until the New York Times wrote about it. And frankly, being unaware of the happenings among young people until the New York Times writes about it is possibly The Most Boomer Thing Ever. Even for those who work at the Times -- a few days later Maureen Dowd wrote about getting "OK boomered" by "the 27-year-old in my office" to whom she has turned to for help in deciphering "what makes the TikTok generation tick."
I am not sure there is such a thing as a "TikTok generation," though it definitely sounds like the most fun generation ever. And it's certainly a better name than, say, "extreme weather caused by global warming" generation.
But I am not convinced there is any generation, in the shared experience/personality sense; the baby boom was named, as you will note, for its size. The collective narrative of protest and upheaval followed by rank consumerism and self-satisfaction that the term has come to denote is most certainly not shared by every person born within those years.
Technically, I am a boomer, born at the tail end of the 1946-1964 definition, but I do not identify as one (such a Gen Z term, right?). I got shoulder pads and yuppies rather than love beads and hippies. Air Supply instead of Jefferson Airplane, "St. Elmo's Fire" rather than "Easy Rider."
Indeed, the most enduring legacy of the boomers, also known for a while as the me generation, may be the notion of generational identification. Gertrude Stein famously coined the term the "lost generation" for those who came of age during WWI but she was talking mainly about writers. Hilariously, the generation that preceded, and indeed produced, the boom is known as the silent generation.
"Gen X" is the moniker that stuck to the generation following the boom, and what on earth does that mean? Nothing except not a boomer.
Which is pretty much the whole point of "OK, boomer": That all this generational identification is, at best, nonsense and, at worst, an attempt by certain members of the baby boom generation to continue to define everyone else in relationship to themselves. Or how they define themselves -- when a child I know dressed as a hippie for Halloween, a man at one house she visited remarked, "Oh, you're dressed as a future Republican."
So, obviously, feelings still run high.
Still, it must be hard when, having belonged to a group that was identified as revolutionary, influential and cool, you are dismissed by folks you consider, as a group, lazy, ill-informed and self-entitled. In other words, the same way adults in the 1950s saw members of the baby boom.
The anger you once righteously aimed at "the system" is now often being directed at you. Despite all your sit-in/antiwar/antiapartheid/feminist/Greenpeace credentials, you suddenly stand accused of being part of the problem. Just because you helpfully point out the numerous flaws of the millennials and Gen Z, their "safe spaces," personal pronoun use and workplace demands.
These are, after all, the folks who dare to push back against Martin Scorsese for saying wiseguy movies are more emotionally challenging than superhero movies. People who don't understand the horror of hearing the Rolling Stones in a car commercial. Who know Bob Dylan not as the gravelly-voiced revolutionary but as the guy who won a Nobel Prize, and how much more establishment can you get?
In other words, young people. Boomers have hogged the spotlight and taken heat for years, been blamed and lauded for just about everything. Woodstock changed the nation; the me generation broke America. But "OK, boomer" isn't about history or culture; it's just the latest iteration of " OK, grandpa."
Which stings, of course it does, but guess what? This is exactly how it's supposed to work. Social progression is fueled in large part by generational tension.
We all love to say we want to make the world better for future generations, the implication being that whoever is saying this has the correct vision and the ability to make it happen. But when those future generations have a different idea, or demand deeper revisions -- gun control, say, or a serious commitment to slow climate change, a rethinking of the way groups of people are described or the structure of the traditional workplace -- well, that's taking things a bit too far.
Who do these kids think they are anyway? Fully enfranchised citizens with rights? Who are they to suggest that the generation that gave us increased sexual freedom, advanced civil rights and invented tie-dye might have a thing or two to learn? These are the kids who got trophies just for showing up. Right?
I swear if I hear one more thing about those damn trophies or the languishing work ethic of anyone under 40, if I see one more person over 40 tear themselves away from their smartphones or laptops just long enough to complain about young people being addicted to screens, I will burn all the bras.
Ironically enough, when we aren't deriding the snowflake status of the millennials or Gen Z, we are decrying the pressure they are under.
Those lazy, self-entitled young people went through an education system that was, for the most part, ratcheted up to the point that my kids were doing math in middle school that we didn't learn until college. There are fewer and fewer employment options that do not require a college education and college is tougher to get into and afford than it has ever been. (Seriously, if you can figure out how to get a 4.2 GPA, while playing varsity sports, starting your own babysitting business and volunteering, do you even need a college education?)
But their trophies! (Which, by the way, we gave them.)
So come on, boomers, stop being snowflakes. You are OK, you're just getting old.
Yes, we're all a long way from the Haight and most of us never got there in the first place. But Jane Fonda was arrested for protesting and anyway, "OK, boomer" is not an insult, it's a badge of honor. The fight continues.
Go ahead and argue that social media and the digital economy have as many dangers as benefits. Texting your emotions and taking naked selfies can get folks into trouble.
But just remember that "free love" and "turn on, tune in and drop out" did too.
Seventy isn't the new 30, but it is a very new kind of 70, which is why the young folk even bother talking about you. So take the win.
And know that the moment boomers understand how to use TikTok, TikTok is done.

Texto completo: SPENCER, Iowa — Pete Buttigieg offered a frank assessment of President Trump's supporters while on a three-day swing of Iowa counties that once voted for Barack Obama but turned out for Trump in 2016.
"When you vote for this president, particularly when you vote for him a second time, you are at best tolerating bad things and at worst having very bad things drawn out of you," the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and White House hopeful told reporters over the weekend. TweetButtigieg, 37, made the comments as broad swaths of the Democratic electorate say they want Trump to be the central point of their party's attacks. Policy concerns have often proved a lower priority to anti-Trump die-hards in the Democratic coalition, and all the party's 2020 White House candidates have looked for ways to straddle the divide.
Buttigieg has repeatedly dismissed the idea of "good" and "bad" people when asked by Democrats in Republican areas of the first-in-the-nation state how he planned to unite the country should he win his party's 2020 presidential nomination and the White House next year.
"I promise a presidency that will seek every possible way to do it. One of the things I have in mind for that first day is to ask people across the country to reach out to people you love, who voted differently, and call them up and not talk about politics, but talk about why you care about them," he said in Waverly, Iowa.
The mayor added that he didn't believe the world was made up "of good people and bad people," nor that a person's self-worth was based on how they voted.
"But I do think that the people we vote for can call out what is good in us or can call out what is bad in us. And we have leaders right now who call out what is worst in us, who make us resentful and small, and backward looking, and mean," he said. "If we get this right, not because I'm better or somebody who votes for me is better than my opponent or somebody who votes for them, but because we'll have leadership that reaches what is best in us."
Buttigieg regularly appeals to centrist Democrats by showcasing his pragmatic approach to politics and referring to his Midwestern roots. But his efforts to position himself as an alternative to Joe Biden didn't stop him from potentially offending soft supporters, independents, and moderate Republicans considering caucusing for him on Feb. 3.
"We all love this country. We all recognize a flag that is supposed to be the thing we all have in common, but there's a difference between patriotism, real patriotism, love of country, and using the flag as a weapon to tell some people, they don't belong," he said in Algona. "That's not what I'm talking about when I talk about loving our country. I'm talking about a much deeper understanding of what it means to love our country; one that recognizes that our country is made of people, Americans, and you cannot love our country if you hate half of the people in it."
Buttigieg's trip, a three-day bus tour to make his pitch of hope and belonging, started in Des Moines after the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice Celebration and ended with a town hall in Spencer. His visit kicked-off with the release of a New York Times/Siena College Iowa poll that showed him surging in the state and positive reviews of his speech at the "LJ" Celebration. His momentum, however, was blunted by an unforced error, receiving backlash over an interview with Showtime's The Circus, in which he said he foresaw the Democratic primary winnowing to himself and Elizabeth Warren.

James Danly, President Trump’s FERC nominee, carefully maneuvered through questioning during his confirmation hearing Tuesday about how he would handle issues related to the evolving electric grid and the commission’s consideration of climate change in approving fossil fuel infrastructure.
Danly, a Republican working as FERC’s general counsel since 2017, said he agreed with the commission’s decision in 2018 to reject the Trump administration’s original bid to subsidize coal and nuclear plants.
Asked by Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich about whether the grid is facing a resilience and reliability threat, Danly said: "I don't see there's a need to be a wholesale revision of the wholesale markets."
In later questioning before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Danly assured his commitment to upholding the competitive wholesale power markets.
“FERC is not in the business of creating winners and losers and never has been,” he said. “FERC’s commitment to market-based solutions has been pretty obvious the last two decades regardless of who has been in the majority.”
Danly was later pressed by coal-state senator John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, about whether the grid is challenged by retiring “baseload” plants, and the FERC nominee again treaded carefully.
“Absolutely,” Danly responded. “The transition from the old dinosaur era of vertically integrated utilities to the current market system has been a challenge and there are many problems. But the electric system is better for it.”
He is bullish on renewables, and said the grid’s transition is a good thing: Danly’s nomination has sparked concern from clean energy groups who worry he would take a hands-off approach at FERC, meaning he could be reluctant to push through changes to modernize the electric grid.
He sought to address those worries in his opening statement, saying he’d work “to remove barriers to entry that could stifle progress as new technologies are developed.”
He said renewables “undoubtedly” will have a significant role in the future electricity mix, and said wind and solar can reliably be integrated onto the grid “under the right circumstances.”
And he said he backs the authority of states to set their own clean energy policies.
Evading questions on climate reviews: Danly also was careful responding to questions on how FERC handles evaluations of the effects of downstream greenhouse gas emissions in approving natural gas projects, saying he'd follow a court ruling that it must consider them.
"I agree with the D.C. Circuit when it hands down a binding ruling, yes,” he said.

EXCLUSIVE...HAPPER DISHES ON FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE SCIENCE: William Happer failed at the chance of his lifetime.
A notorious climate change science skeptic, Happer, 80, recently left the Trump administration after the White House killed his plan to create a panel to challenge government assessments of global warming.
But Happer remains undeterred, confident that Trump, the most vocal climate change skeptic to occupy the White House, is naturally inclined to come around to the idea.
"Hard things often take a long time,” Happer told Josh in his first interview since leaving the administration in September. "I hope it's in my lifetime.”
After leaving his post as a National Security Council senior director, Happer has returned to Princeton, where he is an emeritus physics professor.
Happer is as eager as ever to challenge the climate science consensus, calling it a "completely imaginary threat that doesn't exist. People are afraid to stand up and say that.”
He compared his crusade to the experience of the protagonist in an 1882 play by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, “An Enemy of the People,” which tells the story of a man who speaks an “unpalatable truth” and is punished for it.
Happer said he’d consider returning to the Trump administration, if asked, to press his case after the election, but he’s not “coveting it.”
“When the history of this period is written, I want historians to say not everyone was corrupt,” Happer said. “So, I want to look good in history. I have no doubt that I will, but I am realistic about these things.”
Read more of Josh’s interview with Happer here.
TRUMP BEGINS LEAP OUT OF PARIS PACT ON DAY ONE: The Trump administration leaped at the opportunity Monday to start the process of leaving the Paris climate agreement, setting in motion a long-anticipated move to become the first country to exit the pact.
The State Department filed a notice of its intention to the U.N. Under the terms of the agreement, the United States had to wait until Monday to submit the paperwork even though Trump announced in June 2017 that he rejected the deal.
"In international climate discussions, we will continue to offer a realistic and pragmatic model — backed by a record of real world results — showing innovation and open markets lead to greater prosperity, fewer emissions, and more secure sources of energy," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
"We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters."
Filing the paperwork starts a one-year countdown for the actual withdrawal that can become official one day after the November 2020 presidential election.
The reality is this changes nothing: Nat Keohane, senior vice president of the Environmental Defense Fund, said he expects Monday's announcement to result in little change on the ground.
"The big change was when Trump made that announcement — not when we pass a formal deadline," he told Josh. "At the political level, the U.S. has effectively been a no-show under this administration, and the rest of the world has responded accordingly: by moving on."
DEMOCRATS PROMISE PARIS PAYBACK: Democratic presidential candidates plan to quickly reverse course if they win the White House.
Amy Klobuchar tweeted “I'm getting us back into the international climate change agreement,” on her first day in office.
Elizabeth Warren tweeted the same promise. Joe Biden called Trump’s move out of Paris “shameful.” Bernie Sanders deemed Trump a “national embarrassment” and said he would enact a Green New Deal in addition to rejoining Paris.
THE MAKINGS OF THE SENATE’S CLIMATE CAUCUS: When the Senate’s new bipartisan climate caucus meets for the first time this week, it will be joined by industry CEOs.
That’s in part because the caucus’ two founders — Delaware Democrat Chris Coons and Indiana Republican Mike Braun — say the group is rooted in industry’s shift on climate change, which creates an opening for both parties to work on the issue.
Companies’ shift toward greener, more climate-friendly business practices “made me realize, there’s a window here to appeal to Republicans who are grounded in business, who want metrics for an outcome, and who are willing to meet with and hear from not so much advocates as industry,” Coons told Abby.
Already three Republicans — Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, Utah Senator Mitt Romney, and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham — have joined Braun on the caucus, Braun said.
The reaction Braun’s gotten from his colleagues has been positive, along the lines of “glad you did it, we need to be in the conversation,” he recalled. “That’s all I wanted to do was be in the conversation.”
Read more from Abby’s sit-down, joint interview with the senators in this week’s Washington Examiner magazine.
GIVE PG&E TO THE PEOPLE, MAYORS SAY: San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo has recruited more than a dozen California mayors and city officials to back his plan for a customer-owned Pacific Gas & Electric.
The group of mayors — which include the leaders of Sacramento, Oakland, and Berkley — are calling on California utility regulators to include Liccardo’s plan as they weigh the future of the utility, currently in bankruptcy proceedings. PG&E has been California’s punching bag in recent weeks, as it has shut down the power multiple times for millions of customers amid severe weather and heightened risk of wildfires in the state.
California Governor Gavin Newsom said he would convene a meeting this week of PG&E officials and shareholders, wildfire victims, and creditors about how to get the utility out of bankruptcy.
The mayors want a customer-owned PG&E to be on the table: A customer-owned PG&E would be better positioned to make the millions in investments needed to harden the grid and protect the state from wildfires, the city officials wrote in a letter Monday to the California Public Utilities Commission. The plan would also allow a path to restore trust in the company, they say.
“To the extent that the public continues to believe that a profit motive has dominated PG&E’s decision making, the enterprise will never regain the trust of its customers, its regulators, and public policy-makers,” add the officials, who together represent more than 5 million Californians.
FREEDOMWORKS SEEKS PROBE OF CLIMATE ADVOCACY GROUP: The conservative free market group is calling on the Trump administration to scrutinize how the Climate Investigations Center — which describes itself as a watchdog on climate deniers and fossil fuel companies — obtains its information.
The climate group is improperly obtaining fee waivers under the Freedom of Information Act, abusing the process for “fishing expeditions” to attack companies and groups they oppose, Chris Gober, the lawyer representing FreedomWorks, wrote in a complaint to the Justice Department on Tuesday. The group sent similar letters to the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Interior.
Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, told Abby the climate group is abusing its nonprofit status to bypass FOIA fees “in a way that is profound.”
Stopping the group’s practice of receiving FOIA fee waivers is “on the very, very low-hanging fruit side,” Pye said, adding he is hopeful the Justice Department will revisit the climate group’s nonprofit status.
EFFICIENCY STANDARDS LIGHT UP COURT BATTLE: More than a dozen state attorneys general and several environmental groups are taking Trump to court for rolling back energy efficiency standards for lightbulbs.
The lawsuits, filed Monday, argue the Department of Energy’s move violates the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which says the agency can’t backtrack on or weaken efficiency limits for appliances. The Energy Department has also separately proposed not to update efficiency limits for incandescent bulbs, even as efficiency groups say LEDs are ultimately cheaper for consumers.
“[T]he United States will become the dumping ground for the inefficient incandescent and halogen models already banned in Europe and being phased out by countries around the world,” Kit Kennedy, senior director of the Natural Resources Defense Council’s climate and clean energy program, said in a statement.

Uber Reports Lower Losses And Growth In Revenue

Texto completo: The ride-hailing company's third-quarter loss was not as wide as the record $ 5.2 billion in the second quarter.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber has reported record losses and slowing growth over the past few months. Its stock has tanked. Investors have called it a "horror show."
On Monday, the ride-hailing company responded with financial results that exceeded what Wall Street had anticipated. While Uber is still losing large amounts of money, it did not bleed as much cash as it did in the previous quarter, and its revenue growth rate improved.
Uber said third-quarter revenue had risen 30 percent from a year earlier, to $ 3.8 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $ 3.6 billion. It posted a net loss of $ 1.2 billion, wider than the $ 986 million loss a year earlier but less than the $ 5.2 billion loss in the previous quarter.
Yet Uber's stock fell more than 5 percent in after-hours trading because the number of new customers coming to the app and overall bookings -- which are rides and food deliveries before the company pays commissions -- were weaker than some Wall Street analysts had expected.
"Our results this quarter decisively demonstrate the growing profitability of our Rides segment," Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, said in a statement. In a conference call with reporters on Monday, he added that Uber would reach profitability -- if it excluded various costs -- in 2021.
Uber continues to face significant challenges as investors become more skeptical of money-burning technology companies. WeWork, the office leasing company, recently scuttled its initial public offering after investors questioned the economics of its business.
Last week, Lyft, Uber's ride-hailing rival in North America, also emphasized profits. The company said that if it excluded different sorts of costs, it would be profitable in late 2021.
Since Uber went public in May, Mr. Khosrowshahi has embarked on a belt-tightening campaign, laying off more than 1,000 workers and cutting other costs. Uber has also introduced services for temporary hiring and financial products for drivers and has acquired a majority stake in a grocery delivery start-up, Cornershop.
"We are going to be driving discipline across the company," Mr. Khosrowshahi said on Monday.
Dan Ives, a managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities, said investors were insisting that Uber demonstrate "a clearer path to profitability, strategic initiatives to gain share in the U.S. and give investors confidence that Dara is the pilot on the plane to steer through a myriad of challenges ahead."
Uber said it had 103 million consumers a month in the third quarter, up 26 percent from a year earlier. It provided 1.7 billion rides and food deliveries, up 31 percent from the same period. Growth was affected by the heavy discounts that Uber continues to provide for shared rides, Mr. Khosrowshahi said.
The company provided more details on each of its businesses on Monday, breaking out its revenues from rides, food delivery, bike and scooter rentals, freight shipment and autonomous vehicles for the first time.
Previously, Uber reported the figures from rides and food delivery as a lump sum. The change is "a step in the right direction from a transparency perspective," Mr. Ives said.
Investor skepticism about unprofitable companies could work in Uber's favor, Mr. Khosrowshahi argued, especially as its food delivery competitors, many of which are still private companies, continue to burn cash by subsidizing deliveries.
"Many of the start-ups in the food delivery category have been trying to use cheap capital to buy their way to growth, but we have seen that capital is getting more expensive and can run dry," Mr. Khosrowshahi said during an earnings call. "Platform leadership is both far cheaper and more permanent."
Nelson Chai, Uber's chief financial officer, said the company was willing to leave markets where food delivery competition had grown unsustainable. In September, Uber pulled out of delivering food in South Korea.
The pressure on Uber's stock is not likely to end soon. On Wednesday, the so-called lockup period on insider sales of its shares will expire. That means Uber's employees and early investors will be able to sell their company stock. If many employees and insiders rush to sell at once, that could cause Uber's share price to decline further.
Mr. Chai said Uber was having an "active dialogue" with its shareholders about how to weather the lockup expiration.
"Obviously there is a lot of supply that's going to hit the marketplace, and we don't know what's really going to happen," he said.

Texto completo: After Apple discovered in June that certain MacBook laptops could overheat, posing a fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission quickly issued a warning, along with information about consumer burns and smoke inhalation.
But after Apple learned that its FaceTime video chat app was enabling consumers to listen in on the conversations of people they called — even when the recipients did not answer their phones — there was no designated federal protection agency to warn Americans or collect reports of privacy invasions.
After Fitbit wristbands began causing people to develop skin rashes and blisters a few years ago, the consumer safety agency announced a recall of about one million of the fitness tracking devices.
But after Strava, a popular fitness tracking app, posted a granular map of its users’ workout routines last year, exposing the locations of users — including personnel on remote military bases in Iraq — there was no agency to alert users to the risks or stop the company from revealing their data.
Why are Americans protected from hazardous laptops, fitness trackers and smartphones — but not when hazardous apps on our devices expose and exploit our personal information?
In the United States, most products are regulated by federal agencies that develop safety standards and enforce fair business practice laws. It’s a consumer protection system that dates back to the 1880s when Congress established regulatory agencies to crack down on abusive giants like the railroad companies.
Today, the Food and Drug Administration vets new prescription drugs before they go on sale. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigates automobile safety hazards and sets fuel economy standards. And the Securities and Exchange Commission protects investors from fraud in stock sales.
By contrast, Americans have almost no safeguards for apps in part because Congress has never established an agency to police Facebook, Instagram, Uber, YouTube and other online services that use sophisticated data-mining tools to surveil, sort and steer people on a massive scale.
In fact, the United States is virtually the only developed nation without a comprehensive consumer data protection law and an independent agency to enforce it. Instead, Americans have to rely on the Federal Trade Commission, an overstretched agency with limited powers, to police privacy as a side hustle. The regulatory void has left Americans at the mercy of digital services that have every reason to exploit our personal information and little incentive to safeguard it.
But that could be changing.
A spate of high-profile data protection failures at Facebook, Google and other giants have spurred public outrage, along with momentum for government oversight.
During the 2016 presidential election, Facebook’s advertising system enabled Russian influence agents to target African-Americans with posts telling them not to vote. Last year, Grindr, the same-sex dating app, shared data on its users’ H.I.V. status with two other companies. In September, Google agreed to pay a $170 million fine and change some of its data-mining practices to settle F.T.C. charges that its YouTube platform violated the federal children’s online privacy protection law.
Ralph Nader, the consumer rights crusader, told me that the tech industry’s “out of control” exploitation of personal data was giving him flashbacks to the 1960s when he was researching a book on the dangers of a then-unregulated automobile industry. That book, “Unsafe at Any Speed,” pushed Congress to establish a new agency, the highway traffic safety agency, to develop federal auto safety standards.
Now some consumer groups and members of Congress are calling for a sweeping data protection law, along with a dedicated federal regulator to enforce it. The idea is to provide Americans with the same level of safeguards for apps as they have for appliances.
“What there should be is a new data protection agency,” Mr. Nader told me. “You have to go into a new agency when the abuse pattern is so expansive that the authority in the existing agencies is obsolete and inadequate.”
Some experts say rising public concern about consumer data is based more on hysteria than actual harm. Creating a separate agency, they say, could hinder the development of beneficial digital services.
“A new agency like this would serve the function of meeting public appetite for some kind of demonstrative enforcement reaction to Facebook and Google,” Jane Bambauer, a law professor at the University of Arizona who studies the social benefits and costs of Big Data, told me. But she was skeptical about the need for a stand-alone data regulator. “Of all the issues facing consumers today, that is not the one that deserves this level of intervention.”
There is of course a middle ground. In mid-October, Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill to bolster the Federal Trade Commission’s powers to police privacy. Called the “Mind Your Own Business Act,” it would enable the commission to impose steep fines for privacy violations and hire 175 additional staff. It would also make it a crime for senior executives to knowingly lie to regulators about their companies’ data practices.
The United States was not always a data protection laggard. In 1974, Congress passed a law, the Privacy Act, regulating how federal agencies handled personal information. It was based on a credo, known as fair information practices, that people should have rights over their data. The law enabled Americans to see and correct the records federal agencies held about them. It also barred agencies from sharing a person’s records without their permission.
Congress never passed a companion law giving Americans similar rights over the records private companies have on them. Historically, Americans have feared big government more than big business. The European Union, by contrast, established a directive in 1995 governing the fair processing of personal data by both companies and government agencies.
Today, the European Union has an even more comprehensive law, the General Data Protection Regulation, and each member state has a national agency to enforce it. Those agencies in Belgium, France, Germany and other European countries have recently acted to curb data exploitation at Facebook, Google and other tech giants.
It’s not just the European Union. Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand have also established stand-alone data agencies. By contrast, American consumers have to rely largely on the F.T.C. to safeguard their personal information, a data protection system that privacy advocates consider as airtight as Swiss cheese.
The commission was established in 1914 to break up abusive monopolies — in oil, steel, sugar and other industries — and ensure fair market competition. In the 1990s, in the early days of the commercial internet, the agency began positioning itself as the country’s de facto privacy regulator. It has since developed expertise in areas like children’s online privacy and mobile app privacy.
But the agency has limited power and equally limited resources. In a letter to Congress in April, Joseph Simons, the commission’s chairman, said that his agency had only about 40 employees devoted to security and privacy issues — while Britain’s data protection agency had about 500 employees.
[If you’re online — and, well, you are — chances are someone is using your information. We’ll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter .]
The agency also has limited attention for privacy.
Its chief enforcement mechanism is the power to investigate and sue companies for unfair or deceptive practices. That means the commission has the responsibility of policing a wide array of misbehavior by a sprawling universe of consumer product companies, from misleading marketing by cereal companies to unfair funeral home pricing to fraudulent labels on hockey pucks.
Can the same regulator simultaneously ensure the fair use of Americans’ data?
“To say to them, ‘Oh by the way, we also want you, while you are worried about hockey pucks, to take on and get your arms around the most dynamic and fast-changing and growing and economically powerful segment of the economy,’ I think may be asking them to be superhuman,” said Tom Wheeler, the former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.
The regulatory history of corporate America over the last century is a tale of one giant industry after another abusing its market power — until Congress establishes a new agency to rein it in.
In 2007, for instance, Elizabeth Warren — at the time a professor at Harvard Law School and now a Democratic senator and presidential candidate — wrote a landmark article called “Unsafe at Any Rate.” The title was a play on Mr. Nader’s “Unsafe at Any Speed.”
In that treatise, Professor Warren argued that novel financial products had far outpaced consumer protections, making it easy for unscrupulous lenders to prey on vulnerable Americans. Four years later, Congress established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. (The Trump administration has recently curbed the agency’s role).
Powerful companies that harvest and monetize Americans’ personal data are now facing a similar moment of reckoning.
“The scale and scope of use, and also of abuse and misuse, is staggering,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, told me. As a remedy, he wants Congress to establish either a new agency or a new data protection bureau within the F.T.C. “Some kind of enforcement agency is necessary,” he said. “One way or the other, it has to be a real watchdog.”
Earlier this year, more than a dozen consumer groups asked Congress to enact baseline privacy protections for consumers and establish a new data protection agency to enforce them. Civil rights experts say a stand-alone data regulator is needed to protect consumers from algorithms that may automatically shunt them in detrimental directions — potentially steering them toward predatory loans, say, or away from job opportunities.
Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a civil rights group, said his organization struggled over the past few years to persuade Facebook and Google to stop allowing predatory payday lenders to use their platforms to target cash-strapped African-Americans. In August, Google banned high-interest lenders from its Google Play app store. “They did it because of pressure, not because they are being held accountable,” Mr. Rashad said. “Without the sort of agency that should be there to hold the industry accountable, we are all going to pay the price.”
But even if Congress were to establish a new agency, fundamental questions about the country’s approaches to data protection would remain. Should regulators be allowed to intervene only after Americans have suffered concrete harms from data misuse, like identity or financial theft? Or should violating an individual’s right to control their personal data be considered a harm in and of itself, whether or not more concrete damage can be demonstrated?
Silicon Valley executives often argue, and rightly so, that the concrete-harms standard helped enable the American tech industry to create online services that are now the envy of the world — while the rights-based model is a major reason European companies largely have not.
California has also been an innovator in data regulation, including enacting the nation’s most comprehensive consumer privacy law, which takes effect in January.
Now two Democratic members of Congress who represent Silicon Valley are preparing to introduce a consumer privacy bill. It calls for the establishment of a federal “digital privacy agency” that would protect Americans’ personal information and prohibit companies from using that data for discriminatory purposes in areas like jobs and credit.
A stand-alone agency, of course, would not be a panacea. But it would give Americans more insight into — and power to challenge — the opaque data-mining practices of tech giants, civil rights groups and privacy experts say.
“We are talking about an absolute power imbalance that will not be solved without very strict rules of engagement for corporations that want to market on the internet,” Mr. Robinson, the Color of Change president, told me. “We need to have a new data protection agency, an agency that examines the social, ethical impact of high-risk data practices.”

Texto completo: House Democrats are doing the right thing by pursuing impeachment against President Donald Trump. But it does create a political quandary for their party.
Democrats have been most successful against Trump when they have focused on his unpopular policies, as they did during the 2017 fight over Obamacare and the 2018 midterms. They have been least successful when focusing on his outrageous behavior, as Hillary Clinton did in her 2016 campaign. Trump’s supporters seem to take his personality as a given and aren’t moved by complaints about it. Some fraction of them, however, can evidently be swayed by his failure to live up to his policy promises.
Impeachment unavoidably returns the focus to the cartoon version of Trump, the gleefully norm-breaking president who resembles no other. The trial is also likely to end in acquittal by the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump will then claim vindication, and Republicans will deride the exercise as a vindictive waste of time and money.
Given the severity of Trump’s misbehavior — turning U.S. foreign policy into an opposition-research arm of his campaign — Democrats had no choice but to start an impeachment inquiry. Yet they need to remember that impeachment is an inherently political process, not a technocratic legal matter. It will fail if it does not persuade more Americans of Trump’s unfitness for office. It will succeed only if he is not president on Jan. 21, 2021.
And it is far more likely to succeed if Democrats can connect it in voters’ minds to a larger argument about the substance of Trump’s presidency.
The most promising version of that argument revolves around corruption: The Ukraine quid pro quo matters because it shows how Trump has reneged on his promise to fight for ordinary Americans and is using the power of the presidency to benefit himself. As Leah Greenberg, a co-founder of the progressive group Indivisible, said: “This man is not working for you. He is working to put his own interests first. And he is endangering the country to do it.”
Corruption is one of the public’s top worries, surveys show. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked the economy as the country’s most important issue, and No. 2 was “reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.” It’s a cross-partisan concern too, spanning Democrats, Republicans and independents.
The corruption argument can appeal to the swing voters who helped elect Barack Obama in 2012, flipped to Trump in 2016 and flipped back to Democrats in 2018. And despite wishful thinking by some progressives, winning swing voters — rather than simply motivating the base — will again be crucial in 2020. “You have to build a bridge for people to walk across,” said David Axelrod, the former Obama strategist, referring to Trump’s 2016 supporters. “If you say the guy is a reprobate and a sleaze and all of that, it’s harder for people who voted for him to walk across that bridge.”
Casting Trump as a reprobate is tempting because, well, he is. He is a “pathological liar,” as Ted Cruz said during the 2016 Republican primaries, as well as a “con artist” (Marco Rubio’s description) and a “race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot” (Lindsey Graham’s). Mick Mulvaney, then a Republican congressman, had the simplest summary: “He’s a terrible human being.”
But none of these descriptions has proved to be an effective political tactic against Trump. He easily defeated all the other Republican candidates who called him nasty names, and Mulvaney now serves Trump as the acting White House chief of staff.
In the 2016 general election, Clinton’s campaign bet that swing voters would be less tolerant of his personal behavior than the Republican base had been. She devoted a greater share of advertising to her opponent’s personality — and less to policy — than any previous nominee this century, according to the Wesleyan Media Project. One Clinton ad showed children watching television while Trump said offensive things on screen.
At the time, the strategy seemed reasonable — and effective. In the campaign’s final weeks, 62% of Americans said they had mostly negative feelings about him, one poll found. Yet some of those 62% voted for him nonetheless. They were unhappy enough with the state of the country, and the Democratic nominee, that they were willing to take a chance on a brash, crass outsider who promised to fight for them.
Two years later, in the 2018 midterms, Democrats adopted a very different strategy, going after swing voters with a less Trump-centric campaign. “We said to the candidates, ‘Don’t even mention his name,’” Nancy Pelosi, Democrats’ leader in the House, told me. “This is not about him.” The campaign should instead be about people’s “hopes and dreams and fears and aspirations and apprehensions,” Pelosi said.
Democrats focused on pocketbook issues like health care and criticized Republicans for not using their power to help ordinary Americans. It worked, thanks to both strong Democratic turnout and persuasion of swing voters. The party retook control of the House, flipping many districts — in Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania and elsewhere — that Trump had won in 2016.
The contrast between 2016 and 2018 fits a global pattern. Demagogues like Trump typically rise to power when people have come to distrust a country’s elites, as Luigi Zingales of the University of Chicago has pointed out. Demagogues “don’t exist in a vacuum,” Zingales said. “The more the elite go after him, the more people think, ‘He’s one of us.’” The better strategy — one that defeated Italy’s Silvio Berlusconi, for example — is to treat demagogues like normal politicians who have failed to deliver.
The Ukraine scandal offers Democrats a chance to do so. As a candidate, Trump promised to fix the country and make it great again. But he didn’t really mean it. From the beginning — like the secret negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow during the 2016 campaign — he has tried to help himself, not the country.
He signed a tax bill that benefits wealthy people like him, not ordinary workers. He has used the presidency to pad the profits of his hotels. And he has damaged U.S. interests by contorting foreign policy, toward Russia, China, Ukraine and others, to make sure he can remain in office and continue enriching himself at taxpayers’ expense.
This argument isn’t entirely separate from a pocketbook campaign message. Many Americans believe that one reason the economy hasn’t been working well for them is the corrupt political system. Some Democrats, like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, are already making this case. Trump himself made it in 2016. In 2020, however, he will be the incumbent president who represents the corrupt status quo.
Of course, he will still use his flamboyant style to present himself as an outsider and cast the Democratic nominee as an elitist insider. But this same style leaves him open to a second message that can fit comfortably with anti-corruption. It’s the chaos argument.
Trump has turned U.S. politics into an exhausting circus. “The best argument against Trump is simply this: We can’t tolerate another four years like these,” Axelrod said. “We can’t wake up to crazy tweets and gratuitous taunts. That gets in the way of solving problems that affect people’s lives.”
George W. Bush skillfully used a version of this strategy in 2000. Bush tied his opponent, Al Gore, to the impeachment of Bill Clinton and promised to “restore dignity and honor” to the White House. Conservative voters, angry about Clinton, turned out in large numbers, and many swing voters, worn out by scandal, voted to put a different party in power.
With Trump on the ballot, the chaos argument can be even sharper: Trump deliberately creates chaos to distract from his failures as president. Democrats don’t need to litigate the details of every false statement. The more effective response may instead be a version of Ronald Reagan’s knowing line: There he goes again.
All of this will depend, first of all, on how well House Democrats conduct the impeachment process. After months of flailing — during and after Robert Mueller’s investigation — the House has been doing a better job recently. A parade of credible, nonpartisan witnesses, like Bill Taylor and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, have been brought in to testify to Trump’s corrupt efforts to distort foreign policy.
But they have also been testifying behind closed doors. The more politically important part of the inquiry will begin when public hearings do. And Democrats will need to avoid the long-winded, disorganized speechifying that characterize most congressional hearings. They will need to make a clear, convincing case — not that Trump is a bad person, but that he has failed the country.

N.Y. writer who accused Trump of sexual assault sues him for defamation

Texto completo: A writer and longtime women's advice columnist sued President Trump on Monday, accusing him of defaming her this summer after she claimed he sexually assaulted her two decades ago in an upscale New York City department store.
E. Jean Carroll publicly described the alleged assault for the first time in June, in a published excerpt of a memoir. At that time and in the new lawsuit, she said that after running into the then-real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, they chatted and shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.
Trump has denied ever meeting her and has said she was trying to promote her book. The White House did not provide immediate comment after the suit was filed Tuesday morning.
"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled," said Carroll, who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, in a statement. "No person in this country should be above the law — including the president."
One year before the 2020 election, Trump is grappling with a number of legal challenges, including the impeachment inquiry on Capitol Hill and lawsuits targeting his businesses and finances. Carroll filed her lawsuit in New York State Court, where another defamation suit against Trump has cleared some key hurdles.
In that case, Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump's reality TV show, "The Apprentice," says Trump groped her and kissed her without permission in 2007.
Zervos was among more than a dozen women in the weeks before the 2016 election who accused Trump of sexual impropriety, following the disclosure of a videotape in which he boasted about grabbing women's genitals. Trump called the women who accused him of wrongdoing "liars," prompting Zervos's suit.
But another defamation case against Trump did not survive. Adult-film star Stormy Daniels sued the president last year after he suggested she had lied about being threatened to keep quiet about their alleged affair. A federal judge in Los Angeles dismissed the suit last October, ruling that Trump's "rhetorical hyperbole" was political and ordering Daniels to pay the president's legal fees.
Carroll's assertion in the lawsuit that Trump "brutally raped her" stands apart from less violent allegations regarding Trump's treatment of women. Under New York law, the alleged incident occurred too long ago to try to press criminal charges.

Progressive group to spend $75m on 2020 campaign
A progressive organization is plunging itself into the presidential campaign, unveiling plans to spend $75 million on digital advertising to counter President Trump's early spending advantage in key 2020 battleground states.
The effort, by a nonprofit group called Acronym and an affiliated political action committee, is an outgrowth of growing concern by some Democratic officials that Trump could build an insurmountable edge in those key states through massive early advertising efforts. Trump has spent more than $26 million so far nationally just on Facebook and Google, more than the four top-polling Democrats — Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, and Pete Buttigieg — have spent in total on those platforms.
“The gun on this general election does not start when we have a nominee; it started months ago," said David Plouffe, who managed Barack Obama's 2008 campaign and was a key adviser to him in 2012, and who recently joined Acronym's board. “If the things that need to happen don't happen in these battleground states between now and May or June, our nominee will never have time to catch up."
Plouffe and Tara McGowan, the founder and chief executive of Acronym, said their digital campaign would kick off immediately with a heavy focus on shaping how the public views Trump and the Democratic Party during the primary season, well before a nominee emerges.
The campaign, which the organization is calling “Four is Enough," will focus initially on key swing states: Arizona, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Ex-NAACP leader to run for Cummings's House seat
Former NAACP chief and US lawmaker Kweisi Mfume said Monday that he will run for the Maryland congressional seat most recently held by his friend, the late congressman Elijah E. Cummings.
Considered an elder statesman in Baltimore politics, Mfume, 71, occupied the Seventh District seat from 1987 to 1996, when he stepped aside to lead the NAACP. Cummings then ran for the seat and won.
Mfume's up-from-the-streets story is well known in the district.
He dropped out of high school, was a teenage father, and turned to crime after his mother, who raised him in poverty, died of cancer in his arms when he was 16.
Inspired by her memory, he says, he returned to school, earning degrees from Morgan State University and later Johns Hopkins University.

Texto completo: Readers agree with David Brooks that the current tipping system is unfair and riddled with problems.
To the Editor:
Re "The Tipping System Is Immoral," by David Brooks (column, Oct. 25):
Tipping is a big con perpetrated by restaurant owners on both servers and customers. Tipping gives discretion to the customer to reward a good dining experience or punish a bad one. But why should a server get paid less because the kitchen is slow or the food is unpleasant? And more to the point, why are servers forced to endure the whims of customers in order to receive a fair wage?
Restaurant servers, like everyone else, ought to be fairly paid for the service they provide. Their wages should be determined in advance through a negotiation with their employer, and not be dependent on the generosity and subjective experience of customers.
It is unfair to require servers to behave obsequiously in the hope of getting a fair wage. Tipping is simply part of the exploitation of unskilled work.

To the Editor:
David Brooks writes that "in a world of rising economic inequality, a 30 to 50 percent tip is a small but direct way to redistribute money to those who are working hard to earn a living." I have seen tipping guidelines go from 10 percent to 15 percent to 20 percent. Now a 30 percent standard? This is obscene.
It shifts the burden of paying a living wage from the business owner to the customer. It encourages tax avoidance. And it makes the valuation of labor dependent upon the whims of each customer. In an age of almost universal credit card use, we do not even know that the tip money is finding its way to the employee.
The solution lies in decent minimum wage laws and reasonable graduation of tax rates. Without these measures, it is no wonder that attempts to eliminate tipping have met with resistance.

To the Editor:
On behalf of thousands of tipped workers who fight for One Fair Wage -- requiring all employers to pay tipped workers a full minimum wage, with tips on top -- I couldn't agree more with David Brooks that relying solely on tipping to earn a living in America is abominable.
Tipped workers use food stamps at nearly double the rate of other workers and have more than twice the poverty rate of the rest of the American work force. Raising their wages to minimum wage with tips on top would dramatically reduce their reliance on public assistance. Perhaps most important, it would reduce incidents of sexual harassment from customers, and narrow the racial and gender pay gap in the restaurant and service industry.
But Mr. Brooks incorrectly described the policy efforts to address these issues. My organization led ballot measures in Washington, D.C., and Maine not to phase out tipping but rather to phase out the subminimum wage for tipped workers. The seven states, including California, that have One Fair Wage have higher restaurant industry job growth rates, higher tipping averages, and one half the rate of sexual harassment as the states with a subminimum wage for tipped workers.
These two ballot measures were reversed by politicians who received campaign donations from the restaurant industry. Fortunately, there is a movement of tipped and subminimum-wage workers to enact One Fair Wage that is gaining traction nationwide.

To the Editor:
David Brooks brings up some important points, and certainly in diners and small restaurants tipping as generously as possible is an excellent way to help service staff make ends meet. However, I absolutely take issue with the notion that I should "always, always, always leave a tip in a hotel room." Four Seasons, Marriott or Accor should expect that I pay their cleaning staff extra because they pay them too poorly?
I am already paying an arm and a leg for my hotel room. On top of that I am to subsidize the shareholders in major corporations that choose to pay their staff wages that verge on abusive? I disagree.

Refugees in Turkey skeptical about return to Syria

Texto completo: AKCAKALE, Turkey - Syrian refugees in this Turkish border town have been celebrating. Every day, news trickles of advances by Turkish-backed troops in carving out a safe zone in northeastern Syria and opening the way for the refugees to return home.
Syrians like Hassan Khalil, 37, one of eight brothers and several cousins who rent a cluster of houses on the edge of Akcakale and survive by working on nearby farms, are impatient to reclaim their homes.
"We have been away for five years," he said.
Yet their excitement is tempered with anxiety.
In seizing the enclave in Syria, Turkey wrested a piece of territory along its southern border from the Kurds, who had taken control of the area amid the chaos of the war in Syria.
But Turkey's invasion resulted in a new problem: Syrian forces - deployed by the very government that had sent refugees fleeing for safety in the first place - promptly moved back into the surrounding area, alarming many of the displaced people desperate to go home.
"We were surprised the regime entered these areas," said Mustafa Hamida, a Syrian lawyer and rights activist who opposes the government of Syria's president, Bashar Assad. "If the regime comes in, we will see a massive campaign of arrests in the region."
For Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, sending troops across the border was not just a matter of repelling the Kurds, whom the Turks view as a threat to their stability. Under political pressure to resolve the refugee crisis, he has insisted on the need for a safe zone to start repatriating some of the 3.6 million Syrians who fled to Turkey.
But with Assad's forces on the move, and supported by Russian troops, few refugees are likely to go back willingly.
The flood of refugees followed an uprising against the government of Assad that began in 2011, as the Arab Spring spread across the Middle East. The government's brutal crackdown on the population led to nationwide calls for his ouster. In the war that followed, more than 100,000 civilians have been killed, and the Assad regime has been accused of using chemical weapons against its own people.
But it was not only the Assad government that sent civilians fleeing.
Khalil, the refugee in Akcakale, said most of his village had been abandoned since Kurdish forces ordered families to leave nearly five years ago, forcing them to take refuge in Turkey. Even Kurdish families were ordered out of the village, Abdi Koy, as part of a campaign of deliberate displacement of the population and the razing of villages by the Kurdish militia in 2015, according to a report by Amnesty International.
Khalil accused the Kurdish militia of detaining one of his relatives and using extortion against another.
Mustafa Bali, head of the media office for the Syrian Democratic Forces, as the Kurdish-led force is now named, dismissed allegations of abuse by the militia as "fabrication and lies." He also denied the accusations made by Amnesty International.
But such accounts are common among Syrian refugees in Turkey and the men fighting alongside Turkish forces, and have stoked refugees' demands for Turkey to help them regain their homes.
Last week, Khalil said, Kurdish forces left his village and Syrian forces allied with Turkey took control of it without a fight. His sister, who was hiding for three days inside her house, called him when she saw the soldiers in the street of the village, 10 miles west of Tel Abyad, Syria.
With the Kurdish forces gone, there is growing anger about car bombs and land mines they are said to have left behind, which have caused civilian casualties in the towns and villages taken over by Turkish-backed forces. A recent explosion from a car bomb in Tel Abyad was so powerful that it shook buildings across the border in Akcakale.
The continuing violence is one reason refugees say they are not willing to return to Syria immediately.
But many also wonder what life might look like in the relatively small area Erdogan has been able to secure for a safe zone. It is roughly 2,000 square miles between the towns of Ras al-Ayn and Tel Abyad, and many refugees wonder how they will survive.
"We will be in a prison," Khalil said. "Our hope was they would control the whole border line."
Erdogan has proposed building 10 towns in the safe zone, with hospitals, schools and industrial sites to accommodate 1 million people. Printed handouts given to foreign journalists at a news briefing last week declared that Turkey would use international money to cover the cost, which is estimated at $26 billion. It was not clear where that money would come from.
Even if it gives refugees from near the border a chance to return to their lands, the zone offers little to those driven from elsewhere in Syria.

Michelin awards are a 'dream come true' for Westchester restaurants

Texto completo: Michelin restaurant ratings can make or break a restaurant. l When Chef Marc Veyrat's La Maison des Bois restaurant in the Haute-Savoie area of France was demoted to a two-star rating this year, down from three stars the previous year, he decided to sue the famed guidebook. l According to The New York Times, Veyrat claimed he was dishonored and that: "My team, I saw them cry." l On the flip side, one could say there were tears of joy in Westchester when Michelin announced earlier this month that it was expanding its reach into the county dining scene for the first time in its 100-plus-year history. l The guide has awarded stars and recognition to New York City dining establishments since 2004. l Michelin awarded Bib Gourmands to eight restaurants, including Maria and Dubrovnik in New Rochelle, RaaSa and Shiraz Kitchen in Elmsford, Scarsdale's Café Alaia, Southern Table in Pleasantville and two Dave DiBari restaurants, The Cookery in Dobbs Ferry and the newly opened Eugene's Diner & Bar in Port Chester. Bib Gourmands are awarded for excellence and affordability.
Last month, Blue Hill at Stone Barns became the sole Westchester restaurant awarded a coveted star, gaining two in its initial Michelin year.
The Michelin recognition, said DiBari (who also owns The Parlor in Dobbs Ferry), solidifies the fact that Westchester's dining scene has been increasing its wealth in great chefs and restaurants.
"It says we're not just a quiet place just outside of a great metropolis that great chefs go to die," he said, noting that both his restaurants "got the (expletive) knocked out of us this past weekend," after the Michelin announcement.
"Westchester is filled with great talent, passionate people, creating its own scene and getting the notoriety it deserves," DiBari said.
Michelin stars have traditionally meant an increase in recognition and an attendant spike in business, but also puts pressure on a restaurant to live up to its Michelin standing.
"There's definitely been an influx of reservations and bodies walking in the door," agreed Michael Ferra of Southern Table, newly opened in 2018. "It's a dream come true."
"The phone hasn't stopped and the restaurant is being booked weeks in advance," added Giovanni Cucullo, the chef/owner of Maria Restaurant, a modern Italian eatery which opened a year ago this past September.
Since the Bib Gourmand, Cucullo said he's seen a 40% increase in business and had his first weekend ever where he ran out of menu items. "Even my bar was wiped out of a few things, especially bourbons," he said.
"The key is to make all the necessary adjustments so food and service do not falter."
He admits that, though it's been a bit overwhelming, he couldn't be happier – or feel more humbled. Since the upturn in business, he's now turned his attention on staffing so he can continue to focus on overall quality of food and service and keep rolling out new and fresh ideas. "I will never rest on my laurels and I know my guests will not allow me to because there are now lots of other great options."
DiBari and others on the list said the Michelin distinction is a boom for business, as it helps shine a light on the county's broad dining options.
And, it's good for the entire area, not just for those who were singled out by Michelin. Chef Peter X. Kelly of the Xaviars Restaurant Group and one of the first "celebrity" chefs in the region (he's a co-founder of Hudson Valley Restaurant Week, was an Iron Chef winner and has restaurants in Yonkers and Congers) said the distinction definitely puts Westchester restaurants under a new light.
Recognition long overdue For Cucullo and others, the awards are redemption for long being passed over for options in New York City.
"For years, I watched as Westchester residents would travel to the city for dinner or stay in Manhattan before taking Metro-North home to Westchester because they couldn't find restaurants of that caliber outside of New York," Cucullo said. "But things have changed and this change is visible in every major city across the country.
"I'm happy to see Westchester restaurants, chefs and its residents finally get the respect and recognition we all deserve."
Added Kelly: "It just shows that you don't have to go to New York City to have an amazing experience in the food industry. We work just as hard if not harder than any Manhattan restaurant to ensure quality food and great service."
He added that the recent Michelin announcement awarding two Michelin stars for Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills is a game-changer, further elevating Westchester's profile and bringing more business to the county.
"The eight restaurants which Michelin awarded their Bib Gourmand designation are all exceptional places that offer not only great food but exceptional value," he said. "I think there will be several more restaurants that make the cut over the next few years and I hope that Michelin will also look to Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess counties in subsequent editions of their famous guides."
Why now? Westchester is hardly a backwater when it comes to dining. Local restaurants and chefs, including Blue Hill's Dan Barber and Eric Gabrynowiz of the now-closed North in Armonk, for example, have been lauded with James Beard Awards and nominations; Blue Hill at Stone Barns was also named a Beard Outstanding Restaurant in 2015, and has been listed among the "World's Best 50 Restaurants" for the fourth year in a row.
As for why the county was just included as a Michelin destination after so many years, Gwendal Poullennec, international director of the Michelin Guidebooks, said Michelin is constantly evaluating new culinary destinations.
"Inspectors were particularly impressed by the technique and highest quality of ingredients that they discovered during multiple visits to the area," Poullennec said. "Our move into Westchester County is a natural progression from restaurants in the City to those a short drive away."
Maria's Cucullo has another thought behind the sudden expansion: "The food industry has exploded, fueled by TV and social media and a new generation of food savvy diners. New young talented chefs have come to Westchester to fill those needs and even veteran chefs have learned to adapt and change those 'tired' menus.
"So it's no surprise that Michelin has finally noticed Westchester."

Texto completo: Bucks Laureate announced
Mary Jo LoBello Jerome of New Hope has been named the 2019 Bucks County Poet Laureate, officials at Bucks County Community College announced.
Jerome, a retired educator who began writing poetry as a teenager, rose to the top of 90 entries in the 43rd annual contest, said Dr. Ethel Rackin, director of the poet laureate program that is administered by the college. The contest is sponsored by the Bucks County Commissioners.
Jerome will be honored with a poetry reading and reception at 2 p.m. Nov. 17 at Bucks' Newtown campus, Rackin added, and will later receive a proclamation from the County of Bucks and a $500 honorarium.
Jerome's poems and stories have been published in The Stillwater Review, River Heron Review, Schuykill Valley Journal, US1 Worksheets, Little Patuxent Review, Short Story, and Center magazines. The inaugural winner of Doylestown's Main St. Voices poetry competition in 2015, she has been nominated for a Pushcart Prize and Best of the Net award. She is working on a collection of poems.

Scholarship to honor DiFrancesca
ArtsQuest has announced a new $1,000 scholarship funded by a $25,000 contribution from friends of the late John DiFrancesca.
The scholarship will be awarded annually to a student in the ArtSmart program who is interested in attending summer art camps or advanced art classes at the Banana Factory Arts Center. It will be presented each year at the Linny Awards.
Designed for Bethlehem area middle and elementary school students, the ArtSmart after-school enrichment program provides personalized, hands-on instruction in artforms like ceramics, painting, drawing, glassblowing, photography, mosaics, printmaking and fiber arts.
DiFrancesca was a beloved and well-known Lehigh Valley personality who passed away April 20, 2018 in Allentown. For more than 30 years, DiFrancesca was a respected and key figure in the East Coast music scene. He started out as a vocalist, became a band leader and then moved on to management and booking bands. His band, The High Keys, was very successful and well known, recording the popular doo-wop/rock Christmas song, "The Christmas Game."
DiFrancesca later went into the real estate business, managing and developing rental and commercial properties. In addition, he laid the groundwork for a new bank called Ambassador Bank of the Commonwealth back in the late 1980s.
His involvement in the church was one of his proudest activities, and he was a member of the Church Choir at St. Anthony's in Easton. He would sing duets in the church, and at Christmas he performed "Dormi Non Piangere."
DiFrancesca was known for his dedication to his friends and family, as well as his engaging, warm and upbeat personality. With his passing, he left a legacy of caring, sensitivity and commitment.
For information on the new scholarship, as well as how to nominate a student, contact ArtsQuest Director of Education and Outreach, Lisa Harms at lharms@artsquest.org.
St. Luke's miners to be represented
St. Luke's Miners Campus installed a new piece of artwork in its lobby this month - a portrait entitled, "Coal Miner." The miner in the photo is Joe "Portus" Malusky (1926-1997), who lived and worked in the Schuylkill County community.
The photographer behind the "Coal Miner," Frank Schramm, is an internationally acclaimed photographer whose work has often captured the beauty of people in their everyday work environments. Frank had a special place in his collection for images he captured of workers in the Pennsylvania Coal Region, including "Coal Miner," a print of which he had gifted to St. Luke's surgeon, James Balshi.
Dr. Balshi contacted St. Luke's Miners Campus president, Wendy Lazo, about donating a new, larger print of the portrait (from the original negative) to the lobby of the hospital. "I hoped this image could become a symbol of the hospital's mission and re-affirm St. Luke's commitment to the coal community, and the hospital's historic role in the community," says Dr. Balshi.
Portus Malusky worked for the Kocher Coal Company in Tower City. His daughter-in-law, Helen Droskinis, recalls that he was not only dedicated to his job as a miner, but more importantly, he was dedicated to the mining community.
That dedication was tested in 1977 during the Porter Tunnel Disaster, in which 10 miners were trapped when an adjacent mine broke through into the tunnel, causing the mine to flood. Portus, who was 54 at the time, was a member of the crew who worked tirelessly for five days in the rescue and recovery effort. Helen recalled the nights that she and her husband and mother-in-law would stay awake until Portus' middle shift was over to hear about the efforts to save the trapped men.
"Portus and the other rescuers didn't give up," recalls Helen. "That speaks volumes about the strength of the mining community here in the Coaldale area." Even after the devastating accident, which claimed the lives of nine of the 10 miners, Portus continued to work in the mines for several years - a testament to the courage, work ethic and dedication to his fellow miners in the coal community.
That dedication to the mining community is exactly why Dr. Balshi wanted to share the image of Portus with St. Luke's Miners Campus. The hospital, in its early days, was called "Miners Memorial Hospital" because the coal miners of the area were quite literally invested in the hospital, using their own money to help fund its construction.

Texto completo: The fires and the blackouts are connected to a larger problem in this state: a failure to live sustainably.
SAN FRANCISCO -- I have lived nearly all my life in California, and my love for this place and its people runs deep and true. There have been many times in the past few years when I've called myself a California nationalist: Sure, America seemed to be going crazy, but at least I lived in the Golden State, where things were still pretty chill.
But lately my affinity for my home state has soured. Maybe it's the smoke and the blackouts, but a very un-Californian nihilism has been creeping into my thinking. I'm starting to suspect we're over. It's the end of California as we know it. I don't feel fine.
It isn't just the fires -- although, my God, the fires. Is this what life in America's most populous, most prosperous state is going to be like from now on? Every year, hundreds of thousands evacuating, millions losing power, hundreds losing property and lives? Last year, the air near where I live in Northern California -- within driving distance of some of the largest and most powerful and advanced corporations in the history of the world -- was more hazardous than the air in Beijing and New Delhi. There's a good chance that will happen again this month, and that it will keep happening every year from now on. Is this really the best America can do?
Probably, because it's only going to get worse. The fires and the blackouts aren't like the earthquakes, a natural threat we've all chosen to ignore. They are more like California's other problems, like housing affordability and homelessness and traffic -- human-made catastrophes we've all chosen to ignore, connected to the larger dysfunction at the heart of our state's rot: a failure to live sustainably.
Now choking under the smoke of a changing climate, California feels stuck. We are BlackBerry after the iPhone, Blockbuster after Netflix: We've got the wrong design, we bet on the wrong technologies, we've got the wrong incentives, and we're saddled with the wrong culture. The founding idea of this place is infinitude -- mile after endless mile of cute houses connected by freeways and uninsulated power lines stretching out far into the forested hills. Our whole way of life is built on a series of myths -- the myth of endless space, endless fuel, endless water, endless optimism, endless outward reach and endless free parking.
One by one, those myths are bursting into flame. We are running out of land, housing, water, road space and now electricity. Fixing all this requires systemic change, but we aren't up to the task. We are hemmed in by a resentful national government and an uncaring national media, and we have never been able to prize sustainability and equality over quick-fix hacks and outsize prizes to the rich.
All of our instincts seem to make things worse. Our de facto solution to housing affordability has been forcing people to move farther and farther away from cities, so they commute longer, make traffic worse and increase the population of fire-prone areas. We "solved" the problem of poor urban transportation by inviting private companies like Uber and Lyft to take over our roads. To keep the fires at bay, we are now employing the oldest I.T. hack in the book: turning the power off and then turning it back on again. Meanwhile, the rich are getting by: When the fires come, they hire their own firefighters. (In the case of the Getty fire in Los Angeles, their gardeners and housekeepers still had to go to work, though.)
Does all this sound overdramatic? You might point out that if it seems like dystopian apocalypse in California, it's because it has always felt like dystopian apocalypse in California. The California of Joan Didion, Charles Manson and Ronald Reagan was no picnic; nor was the California of Pete Wilson, Rodney King or Arnold Schwarzenegger. California has always been a place that seems to be on the edge and running on empty, and maybe the best you can ever say about it is, hey, at least we're not Florida.
But this time it's different. The apocalypse now feels more elemental -- as if the place is not working in a fundamental way, at the level of geography and climate. And everything we need to do to avoid the end goes against everything we've ever done.
The long-term solutions to many of our problems are obvious: To stave off fire and housing costs and so much else, the people of California should live together more densely. We should rely less on cars. And we should be more inclusive in the way we design infrastructure -- transportation, the power grid, housing stock -- aiming to design for the many rather than for the wealthy few.
If we redesigned our cities for the modern world, they'd be taller and less stretched out into the fire-prone far reaches -- what scientists call the wildland-urban interface. Housing would be affordable because there'd be more of it. You'd be able to get around more cheaply because we'd ditch cars and turn to buses and trains and other ways we know how to move around a lot of people at high speeds, for low prices. It wouldn't be the end of the California dream, but a reconceptualization -- not as many endless blocks of backyards and swimming pools, but perhaps a new kind of more livable, more accessible life for all.
But who wants to do all this? Not the people of this state. Sure, we'll ban plastic bags and try to increase gas-mileage standards (until the federal government tries to stops us, which of course it can, because our 40 million people get the same voting power in the Senate as Wyoming's 600,000).
But the big things still seem impossible here. In a state where 40 years ago, homeowners passed a constitutional amendment enshrining their demands for low property taxes forever, where every initiative at increasing density still seems to fail, where vital resources like electricity are managed by unscrupulous corporations and where cars are still far and away the most beloved way to get around, it's hard to imagine systemic change happening anytime soon.
And so we muddle on toward the end. All the leaves are burned and the sky is gray. California, as it's currently designed, will not survive the coming climate. Either we alter how we live here, or many of us won't live here anymore.

Texto completo: Just 4,000 have been deemed eligible to enter the United States over the next year, and a slowdown in the screening process means far fewer are likely to come.
WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is refusing to take in thousands of Iraqis who risked their lives helping American forces during the Iraq war, cutting the number of high-priority refugees allowed into the United States this year and drastically slowing background checks they must undergo.
Only 153 Iraqi refugees whose applications were given high priority were admitted in the fiscal year that ended in September -- down from a high of 9,829 in the 2014 fiscal year, according to government data obtained by The New York Times.
An estimated 110,000 Iraqis are waiting to be approved as refugees based on their wartime assistance. But on Friday, the Trump administration capped the number eligible this year at 4,000.
After the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that forced Saddam Hussein from power, thousands of Iraqis worked with American troops, diplomats and contractors, serving as translators and cultural advisers. Those Iraqis and their families were threatened, and in many cases attacked, by Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias who accused them of siding with Americans during the eight-year war.
Suhad Munshid left Iraq and resettled in Missoula, Mont., in April -- nearly seven years after she applied for a priority refugee visa. The "semi-impossible" application process will probably keep her sister in Iraq from receiving priority status, she said in an interview on Friday.
"I have my only sister living in Baghdad," she said. "It's really concerning with what is going on, and I have to call her every day to make sure she is O.K."
Ms. Munshid's brother-in-law worked as a cook for American troops in Iraq in 2006, and her family's home was used as a safe house for soldiers who needed to rest during patrols in Sadr City, a poor neighborhood in Baghdad. But only after the United States declared in 2011 that the war was over and withdrew most of its troops did Ms. Munshid come to believe that she and her family needed to move to America, to escape rampant bombings and increasing instability.
"Every time that I went out, I was not certain that I would make it back home," said Ms. Munshid, 36, speaking through an interpreter. She now works at a T.J. Maxx in Missoula, stocking shelves; her husband is a chef at a local Indian restaurant.
In an official notice issued late Friday, President Trump capped the number of worldwide refugees the United States will admit in the 2020 fiscal year at 18,000, a record low. The move, which had been expected for weeks, was meant to protect what Mr. Trump described as refugees of "special humanitarian concern."
Last year, 30,000 refugees were allowed into the United States. During President Barack Obama's last year in office, 110,000 were admitted.
Over all, about 300,000 people worldwide are actively seeking refugee status to enter the United States. The new cap means that 6 percent of them have a chance of being admitted over the next year, amid what the United Nations has declared a worldwide crisis involving nearly 26 million refugees, half of whom are children.
It is also the first year that the United States has set limits for groups of refugees based on the threats they face at home, as opposed to what part of the world they are from.
Of the 18,000 refugees who will be admitted this year, 5,000 slots are reserved for people persecuted for their religion, 4,000 for high-priority Iraqis and 1,500 for Central Americans. The remaining 7,500 slots will be open to those applying from elsewhere in the world.
But two government officials said that far fewer high-priority Iraqi refugees were expected to be admitted in 2020.
Interviews for applicants -- a necessary step in the refugee process -- have been slowed and significantly limited since the American Embassy in Baghdad and Consulate in Erbil ordered all nonessential employees out of Iraq for security reasons in May, the officials said.
As a result, very few of the estimated 110,000 Iraqis who appear to be eligible for the refugee program have been interviewed by immigration officers or undergone other screening processes necessary before they can move to the United States, the officials said. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity to more frankly discuss an internal and politically delicate issue.
A spokesman for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, which conducts the interviews, said teams of refugee officers continue to travel to the Middle East, including to Iraq, to interview applicants on what are known as "circuit rides." The spokesman would not say when the last circuit ride in Iraq had been conducted, citing security concerns.
A State Department spokeswoman said fewer high-priority Iraqi refugees had been admitted to the United States in part because of tougher background checks ordered by Mr. Trump last year. "The security checks take time, but they are critical," she said.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Saturday that American support for refugees went beyond the immigration system, and pointed to a border crisis that warranted certain limits.
"Prioritizing the cases of those already in our country is simply a matter of common sense," he said in a statement.
Since the 2008 fiscal year, the United States has accepted 47,331 Iraqi refugees under the Direct Access Program, giving priority in the resettlement process to those who were affiliated with the American government during the Iraq war. Of those, 3,249 were accepted during the first three years of the Trump administration, the government data show.
Initially, the Pentagon had requested that 6,000 slots be given to the high-priority Iraqi refugees for the 2020 fiscal year. But others in the Trump administration, wary of a continued threat from the Islamic State, fought to lower the number of Iraqis, viewing them as a security risk.
Over the summer, the Department of Homeland Security deported Jimmy Aldaoud, who was born in Greece to Iraqi parents and had lived in the United States since he was an infant. He had accumulated at least 20 criminal convictions over 20 years and was sent to Iraq, where he had never lived and did not speak the language.
His death in Baghdad -- alone, sick and begging to return to his family in Detroit -- outraged lawmakers and human rights activists.
A new spate of unrest across Iraq -- weeks of violent demonstrations by protesters who demand public services and are challenging government corruption -- has made refugee applicants all the more anxious.
Ms. Munshid, who was resettled by the International Rescue Committee in Missoula, said she never considered leaving Iraq during the war. It was only after the American military withdrew, and the tenuous security began to unravel, that she listened to the urgings of her brother-in-law, who moved to Seattle in 2010.
"He started telling us how safe it is here in America and how people could live prosperous lives," she said in Arabic.
Then, for the only time in a 23-minute interview, she switched to halting English.
"I like America," she said.

It's clear: District is a baseball town

Texto completo: It's hard to believe amid the World Series bliss, but for many years, common wisdom decreed that Washington could never be a baseball town.
We lacked true fans, it was said. Bureaucrats and other white-collar types aren't passionate about sports. The local football team gobbled up whatever enthusiasm was available.
It was insulting then, and now we can say with assurance it was ignorant as well. Not only can the region support a team with ticket sales, TV viewership and the donning of red apparel, we also can give the rest of the country a few lessons on how to have fun doing it.
Our reputation was more than just a mild irritant. For 33 years, until the Nationals arrived in 2005, it hurt our image to be the nation's largest metro area without a baseball team. Who would want to live, work or invest in a city shut out from the national pastime?
Worse, it fed the perception that we are "just a government town," a soulless, one-dimensional place lacking the spark and liveliness of a thriving, multifaceted community. A World Series story in the New York Times rehashed this outdated stereotype, calling Washington an "isolating and serious place to live sometimes," where "it takes a lot for Washingtonians to get excited about the same thing." (The Times removed the latter sentence in response to justified public outrage.)
The entire nation - or at least those who followed the playoffs - has witnessed just how wrong that judgment is. As baseball writer Nick Stellini noted in my favorite tweet of the Series, Houston was the uptight side:
ASTROS: We have assembled the most terrifying pitching staff since the 90's Braves. Our defense is stifling. Our offense is relentless.
NATS: Our entire stadium does the Baby Shark clap. We do Riverdance when we hit homers. Brian Dozier knows all the words to Calma.
D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) joined the fun. After the dreadful interference call against Trea Turner in Game 6, she tweeted, "Hey Alexa - can a mayor fire an umpire?"
In some ways, the Nats' victory caps a 17-month winning streak for the Washington region and not only in sports. It began with the Capitals winning the Stanley Cup in June 2018, the first championship for a Washington team in one of the four major leagues (the NHL, NFL, NBA and Major League Baseball) in 26 years.
Then, a year ago, Northern Virginia beat out more than 230 other locations nationwide to win the biggest economic development prize in memory - 25,000 high-paying jobs at Amazon's new second headquarters .
That showed the world something that people here have known for years: We are an innovative tech center, with a steadily expanding private sector, and not just leeches sucking on government contracts. (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)
The Washington Mystics followed up with our first WNBA championship last month.
"It's been a great year, with Amazon, the Mystics and now the Nats," said Jim Dyke, a former Virginia education secretary, former chairman of the Greater Washington Board of Trade and Nats season ticket holder. The Nats' win "shows the region has a lot of things going for it, culturally and with things to do," Dyke said. "It give people a chance to see the spirit that we have."
When outsiders talk about Washingtonians uniting over sports, they invariably focus narrowly on the setting aside of differences over politics and ideology. Hey, both Brett M. Kavanaugh and Elena Kagan are here at the ballpark! George Will and Chris Matthews, too!
But the phenomenon is so much broader than that. Nats revelry brings together the city and its suburbs. It bridges economic and racial divides.
"It doesn't matter what age or what race, sports brings so much joy to a city," said Jimmy Lynn, an adjunct professor of sports marketing at Georgetown University.
For too many decades, baseball was not part of that experience here. I was one of those who suffered. Moving here at age 6, at the end of the Eisenhower administration, I quickly became a fan of the Washington Senators, only to see the team leave town - twice.
The owners blamed the city for what they said was lack of support. In reality, they were out for a buck and didn't care enough about the community to field decent teams. (Rooting for the bottom-dwelling Senators in that era prepared me to be a Redskins fan today.)
Then followed 33 years of purgatory, when MLB refused to give us a team despite the region's steady growth in population and economic muscle. Many of us rooted for the Baltimore Orioles but with the nagging awareness that we were trespassing on others' turf.
Finally, after a close-fought political battle in the District to win public funding for a new stadium, the Nationals arrived. Their principal owners - the Lerner family, who have constructed shopping centers all over the region - were committed to building a winning baseball team as well.
It was gratifying to see the family patriarch, Theodore Lerner, age 94, accept the World Series trophy. He and Mark Lerner, his son and heir, have dreamed of owning a team here and winning it all since before the Senators' second departure in 1971.
"The local ownership makes a big difference, that they're invested in this," said Doug Duncan, a Nats fan who is a former Montgomery County executive and now heads Leadership Greater Washington.
"People know [the Lerners] because they grew up here. Part of the joy was for Ted Lerner to be here and see a championship," Duncan said.
Although football still gets higher TV ratings, Duncan thinks the Redskins' woeful state could allow the Nationals to eventually overtake them as the region's top sports draw.
In any case, there's no question anymore that the region can support a baseball team.
"The region has grown. It's stronger economically. You have more people with an allegiance to baseball," Dyke said. "We've proved we're an excellent market, and it gets even better with this [World Series win]."
In honor of which, Dyke said, he has started using "Baby Shark" as his telephone ringtone.

Texto completo: BY ELANA SCHOR
And AAMER MADHANI
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The ascension of Paula White as an official member of Donald Trump's White House highlights how closely the president is relying on his inner circle of evangelical Christian supporters as he fights an impeachment probe during his reelection bid - while giving liberal Christians a new opening to push back at his administration's mingling of religion and policymaking.
White is a televangelist who has sparked division among fellow Christians over her association with the so-called "prosperity gospel," an assertion that God rewards believers with personal and financial success. She's also frequently identified as personal minister to the president and is now set to become an adviser heading Trump's Faith and Opportunity Initiative, according to a White House official.
In some ways, White's new position only formalizes her long-standing influence in the White House. The 53-year-old has known Trump for more than 15 years and frequently meets with the president alongside fellow evangelical Christian advisers, including a White House visit this week where the group laid hands on Trump in prayer. But White is a more contentious figure within her faith than other pro-Trump evangelicals and was the subject of a years-long investigation into her finances by Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley.
That profile makes White a compelling symbol for liberal Christians who are making an increasingly vocal appeal to religious Americans who do not align with Trump's political agenda.
"The rise of the religious left has been given a shot in the arm every time Trump doubles down on his white evangelical base," said Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons, a religious activist on the left who created an anti-Trump network called The Resistance Prays. "Yes, he may score short term political points. But in the long term, he really is energizing and mobilizing this whole swath of people who are religious and are astonished by what's happening with the
Paula Whites of the world."
Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, a liberal evangelical preacher who works with the progressive group Red Letter Christians, said White's use of her ministry "to exploit the poor ... should be of real concern to all people of faith."
"While we often frame religion in public life as progressives to conservatives, it's important to say that even within that frame, Paula White is an extremist and always has been," Wilson-Hartgrove said.
The White House role for White, whose ministry did not immediately return an interview request, was first reported by The New York Times. White distanced herself from the prosperity gospel in a 2017 statement that said she would "reject any theology that doesn't affirm or acknowledge the entirety of scriptural teaching about God's presence and blessing in suffering as much as in times of prosperity."
The Florida-based White's website features a pitch for followers to purchase a $130 "Favor Seed" in order to help battle "an enemy of debt, depression, a job, or a health issue prevailing against you."
The White House initiative she will advise was created by the Trump administration last year to help faith-based groups partner with the federal government. White's advisory role, according to the executive order setting up the initiative, empowers her to suggest "changes to policies, programs, and practices that affect the delivery of services by faith-based and community organizations."
Beyond White's new position, Trump's meeting this week with his closest conservative evangelical supporters included some discussion of how they would try to energize their contacts on the president's behalf, according to attendee Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. Perkins said that while the Tuesday meeting with Trump was not entirely "a planning session," attendees did perform "a quick inventory" of their own networks to determine what "we can do" to help the president.
"Several of us have daily radio programs and some of us have TV programs and some of (us) lead very large churches and ministries," Perkins said. "It was more looking around the room and how do we be more intentional about getting this out there and using the platforms that we already have."

Texto completo: "Baby, It's Cold Outside" always seemed a little predatory to Twin Cities musician Lydia Liza.
"It's creepy," she said. "I never liked it, not even as a kid."
That's why in 2016 she and then boyfriend Josiah Lemanski covered the classic holiday tune with a twist -- more consent, less overt sexual pressure.
"I really can't stay (Baby, I'm fine with that)
I've got to go away (Baby, I'm cool with that)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you get home safe)
So very nice (I'm glad you had a real good time)"
Their updated version garnered national and international attention, with write-ups in the New York Times, Washington Post, Irish Times and the CBC. They were largely credited with retooling the lyrics for the #metoo era, with an unprecedented focus on consent in sexually charged interactions.
Now, John Legend and Kelly Clarkson are also updating the tune, specifically the lyrics, for a modern audience, according to a profile of Legend in this month's Vanity Fair.
"Legend has updated the lyrics with Natasha Rothwell ('Insecure') and recorded it with his fellow 'The Voice' coach Clarkson. The song's every bit as fun and swinging as the original, and its newfound
sensitivity feels genuine, not performative.
'What will my friends think…' sings Clarkson.
'I think they should rejoice,' Legend responds.
'… if I have one more drink?'
'It's your body, and your choice.' "
Liza said she found out about the new version of "Baby, It's Cold Outside" when a friend texted her.
At first she was taken aback -- hadn't she already updated the lyrics? -- but she then changed her mind.
"I think they could do a really good job," Liza said. "Of course, I'm fond of our own version and how we were able to raise so much money for sexual violence organizations. I hope they'll do the same."
Through Rock the Cause Records, a nonprofit record label based in the Twin Cities, Liza and Lemanski's version of the song has raised a substantial amount of money -- about $10,000 -- for organizations such as the Sexual Violence Center, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network and the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence.
Scott Herold, founder and CEO of Rock the Cause, sees the Legend and Clarkson version of the song as a plus for the one produced by Liza and Lemanski, who's "Baby, It's Cold Outside" has been streamed over 100,000 times in the last 30 days alone.
"Here's the beautiful thing," he said, "they're already on several official Spotify playlists and tens of thousands of listener-driven playlists. People aren't going to stop listening to their song. This will just bring more awareness to the cause. Every Christmas it's gotten bigger than the prior Christmas.
"If all goes well this holiday season we could raise [an additional] $7,000 to $10,000 for organizations working to end sexual violence."
And that's the point, as far as Liza is concerned.
The song "is not mine to keep," she said. "It's an ever-expanding, ever-changing conversation, and a new version would be the next step in that."

Heisler: Warriors just went from dynasty to expansion team

Texto completo: Farewell, little dynasty.
That splat you heard was the the Warriors, who dominated the NBA the past five seasons as it went from marginally profitable to immensely wealthy, hitting the pavement like an egg dropped from space.
Of course, it’s still way early to write them off, as TNT’s Charles Barkley did, predicting they wouldn’t even make the playoffs … at halftime of their opener … or, at least it was until Steph Curry broke his hand in the fourth game.
There’s now a common theme in Warriors stories
Will they tank?
Shouldn’t they tank?
Are they tanking?
Isn’t it timely that they lost Curry, removing the temptation to claw into the playoffs so they can tank … as owner Joe Lacob seemed to suggest to The Athletic (“Potentially, there’s a silver lining in all of this, who knows?”)
Not that the Warriors may have a choice with all of last spring’s nine rotation players, and all three of their Big Three, out or gone for the duration: Curry, Kevin Durant, Klay Thompson Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, DeMarcus Cousins and Quinn Cook.
That left Draymond Green, who hurt just his left index finger, and Kevon Looney, who’s out with a pulled hamstring.
Things started off challenging with Las Vegas setting their over-under at 47 wins, No. 6 or 7 in the West.
Then, unfortunately for the Warriors, the season started.
Game 1: In the opening of the new Chase Center, the Clippers beat them by 19 points, after leading by 31.
Thompson, recovering from knee surgery, goes on with TNT at halftime, airs his hopes … and has Barkley inform him to his face they won’t make the playoffs.
As if agreeing, Coach Steve Kerr notes, “This is not a one-off. This is the reality. There are going to be nights like this this year.”
Game 2: Showing Kerr was right, they lose by 28 in Oklahoma City … after trailing by 41 … to the Thunder, a 1-4 team going into this weekend.
Game 3: Win in New Orleans!
Game 4: Lose by 11 in Phoenix … after trailing by 33.
In the very bad, awful, no good, worst possible news, Curry breaks his left hand early in the third quarter with the Warriors down by 29.
Game 5: Back home, lose to Spurs by 17 … after trailing by 25.
They now start Green, D’Angelo Russell, Glenn Robinson, Willie Cauley-Stein and rookie Jordan Poole, looking more like an expansion team than a dynasty.
This isn’t just a fall. This is the end of the pride of the NBA.
The Warriors didn’t invent the modern offense, spacing the floor with three-point shooters. That was Mike D’Antoni in coaching stints at Phoenix, New York and Houston.
Nevertheless, it was Steph, Klay & Co. who took it and ran with it, popularizing an approach that had always been anathema, expressed by the mantra, “Live by the jump shot, die by the jump shot.”
With their unprecedented firepower came a coincidence of personalities that made the Warriors a delight for the press and lured KD as a free agent in 2016: the personable Kerr … the sweet-tempered Curry, everyone’s favorite … the unaffected Thompson … the trash-talking, stand-up guy, Green.
“To me, they speak not just to the modern NBA, but to the unique place that sports can have in society,” said Commissioner Adam Silver before the season.
“And it’s not just the spirit they bring to the game on the floor, but, I think, the spirit they bring as citizens and to their participation in their community.”
The ascent was symbolized by the $1.4 billion Chase Center they built in San Francisco with money they raised privately, leaving the boondocks of the East Bay.
With personal seat licenses estimated at $18,000 each, revenue is projected to zoom from last season’s $400 million that was already ahead of the Lakers’ $398 million, according to Forbes, to $700 million … ahead of every team in every U.S. league except the Dallas Cowboys.
This is a new reality, indeed. The Lakers, long the NBA’s richest team, used to wish there was no salary cap so they could spend whatever they wanted. Now they can thank their lucky stars there is one
(Giannis Antetokuonmpo, anyone? He’s not free until 2021 but the big teams are eyeing him in all they do.)
The Warriors cherished the fact they were all in this together, but it was no longer true.
Things began unraveling last fall when Green argued with Durant, who had spurned an extension to sign for one year, signaling his intention to become a free agent.
“We won without you,” snapped Green, according to Yahoo’s Chris Haaynes. “We don’t need you. Leave.”
Dray and KD made up, insisting it was behind them in countless interviews … until last week when Durant, now in Brooklyn, acknowledged the blowup had been a factor in his decision to leave (“I mean, your teammate talked to you that way, you think about it. … Definitely, for sure. I’m not going to lie about it.”)
Nevertheless, the Warriors clung to their illusions to the bitter end when Durant went down in Game 5 of the Finals.
GM Bob Myers choked back tears in the interview room. Teammates were glum, despite having just won to cut the Raptors’ lead to 3-2.
If KD wanted most of all to be loved, it looked like the outpouring of grief might persuade him to stay.
Instead, he signed with the Nets to play alongside Kyrie Irving, who is already reportedly showing the mood swings in Brooklyn that he had in Cleveland and Boston.
Of course, the Warriors will try to put Humpy Dumpty back together next season, but they’re not the kids they were when they won the first of their three titles in 2015.
Curry, 31, was averaging 20 points and 2.3 threes, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 30 and 5.1 … as Kerr noted they can’t just turn Steph loose, a la James Harden (“That kind of basketball wears you out, especially for a guy who’s 180 pounds like Steph is.”)
With all those shot attempts and points gone, Green, 29, is averaging a pale 9.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 0.0 blocks, compared to his pre-KD zenith of 14-10-7 with 1.4 blocks.
Thompson, 30, may be coming off a missed season.
You can’t say they didn’t enjoy the journey. In 2015 after winning their first title, Lacob told the New York Times, “We’re light years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in planning, in how we’re going to go about things. We’re going to be a handful for the rest of the NBA to deal with for a long time.”
So they were, but “a long time” is over, the Warriors just learned.

Ceremonies will mark end of World War II

Texto completo: Veterans, re-enactors, military vehicles and '40s swing music will greet visitors to the Battleship New Jersey Museum and Memorial Saturday for World War II Victory Day.
Festivities commemorating the 65th anniversary of the end of war with Japan will conclude with a separate admission event: a barbecue and swing concert featuring a sister act performing an Andrews Sisters show.
Meanwhile, in New York City Saturday, couples will re-enact the famous moment on Aug. 14, 1945, when an unidentified sailor spontaneously kissed a nurse, an enduring image captured by Life magazine photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt during a V-J Day celebration in jammed Times Square.
The nurse was identified 35 years later as Edith Shain of Los Angeles, who died June 20, according to The New York Times. The soldier's identity was never verified.
Saturday's battleship events will commemorate the moment when the Japanese surrender was announced in the United States at 7 p.m., Aug. 14. (Aug. 15 in Japan). Japan officially surrendered Sept. 2.
Sponsors of both the Camden and New York City events said they are being held in support of a national grass-roots campaign, "Keep Alive the Spirit of '45," to designate a National Day of Remembrance for the end of the war and for the sacrifices of its generation.
Jack Willard, spokesman for the battleship museum, said the observance is the largest ever planned at the museum to mark the end of World War II and aims to capture the spirit at war's end.
Events will be on the pier and on the retired battleship, which served during World War II in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945. Daytime activities from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. are included with regular admission to the ship.
"We'll have 15 vehicles and there even will be a special 1 p.m. re-enactment of the surrender of the Japanese aboard (the USS Missouri), with a Gen. Douglas MacArthur re-enactor on the Big J . . . " he said.
The official surrender signing in Tokyo Harbor occurred aboard the USS Missouri, a sister ship of the New Jersey.
"Even though the signing was not until Sept. 2, we'll try to capture its spirit as well," Willard said.
Vintage car collectors Ernie Baals of Erial and his son, Ernie, will bring three vehicles to the Saturday event that were used by the Army and Marines during the war.
"We enjoy the ship and I'm coming to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the war with my father, a World War II veteran of Guam and Iwo Jima," the younger Ernie said Monday.
This summer, both houses of Congress passed versions of a resolution for a National Day of Remembrance, to be known as Spirit of '45 Day.
Warren Hegg, national supervisor of the campaign, said hundreds of observance events coast to coast will begin with the official kick-off ceremony in Times Square. That celebration will occur in front of a 25-foot sculpture depicting the world-famous Life magazine kiss.
The kiss re-enactment is free and open to couples of all generations if they register at www.timessquarenyc.org. Doors will open at 10 a.m. at military island in the center of Times Square, with the re-enactment to start before noon.

Texto completo: “Correr es mi vida, me hace sentir libre”, afirma con sencillez Guillermo Piñeda Morales, maratonista de 46 años que actualmente se ubica entre los 10 corredores más rápidos del mundo en su grupo etario.
Contrario a la mayoría, “Memo” no se promociona en las redes sociales, no va a gimnasios costosos ni usa cronómetros complicados. Entrena en el parque y se chequea el pulso tocando su propio cuello con sus dedos.
Nativo de Santa Ana Coatepec ( Puebla ), a los 15 años cruzó la frontera indocumentado hacia EEUU. “Vine a trabajar”, dijo.
Laboró en cocinas y como mensajero en bicicleta. Hoy trabaja en el mantenimiento de un edificio en Rego Parks (Queens).
En 1995 corrió su primer maratón y al año siguiente, cuando fue arrestado por estar indocumentado , pensó que todo había terminado y sería deportado. Pero logró pagar una multa y el juez le dio una oportunidad, que concretó con la ayuda de un abogado de inmigración.
En 2005 pudo naturalizarse, lo que a la larga le permitió convertirse en el 2do estadounidense más rápido en su grupo de edad, tras registrar 2:28:42 en el maratón de Boston, en abril de este año.
Sería el primero en México, pero prefiere representar a EEUU, en agradecimiento, afirmó al diario The New York Times.
Sus claves son dos muy puntuales: trabajar duro y nunca rendirse. Este domingo, correrá el Maratón de Nueva York, con el # 477, y así puede ser ubicado en la aplicación oficial de la competencia.
This is Memo. Memo runs fast — like, top 10 in his age group fast. But, he doesn't need any #Fitspo. He only needs two things: Hard work, and never giving up. https://t.co/hYeNf0m3Sx pic.twitter.com/Fxurvp6EMb

Texto completo: She's the wife of Green Bay's most famous quarterback, but she's also a force in her own right.
Deanna Favre has inspired thousands with her public battle against breast cancer and helped even more through her charitable work.
"I'd rather not have the cameras on me," Favre said in an interview late last year when she was promoting her book, "Don't Bet Against Me."
But, she acknowledged, "I know that helping people through his (Brett Favre's) notoriety is a gift."
And, help she has.
Deanna Favre learned she had cancer about three years ago.
She subsequently became a spokeswoman for the pink caps campaign that raised more than $1 million to fight breast cancer; more than 200,000 caps were sold.
And last fall, her book, a memoir on surviving breast cancer, hit the New York Times Bestseller's list shortly after its release, inspiring thousands of readers along the way.
Peggy Anderson, of Bloomer, was one of them. She said reading the book helped her cope with the loss of her sister-in-law, who died of breast cancer last July.
"She was an avid Packer fan, considered the angel in the family," she said of her late sister-in-law.
Favre's book has also inspired Anderson to create a line of breast cancer themed scrapbooks, with proceeds going to the Deanna Favre HOPE Foundation.
Deanna's role in the Green Bay community was also significant.
"Deanna was fantastic at being very visible at community events; she had a passion for it," said Mike Daniels, executive vice president of Nicolet Bank and board member of the Favre Fourward Foundation, an organization started by the Favres to raise money for disadvantaged or disabled children in Wisconsin and Mississippi.
Brett Favre's retirement announcement last week means the family will spend most of their time in their hometown of Hattiesburg, Miss. — and Green Bay will lose not one, but two, community icons.
"The community can't help but suffer," Daniels said. "It will unfortunately have an impact on the community."
Mary Ryan, operations manager of the Brown County Library, said Deanna Favre not only helped contribute financially to programs like the Give-A-Kid-A-Book campaign through the Friends of the Library but was active in its growth. Favre was involved in the library program for 11 years, she said.
"We will miss her a great deal, if she doesn't stay involved," she said. "She brought the program to a level it had never seen. It was wonderful. She's just one of the nicest people."
Deanna Favre also helped make the dreams of a baseball league for kids with disabilities come true, said Paul Liegeois, founder and executive director of the Miracle League of Green Bay.
"Deanna and Brett Favre both ... were very instrumental in helping us exceed our expectations," he said. "Deanna herself was so wonderful."
Kelly Mottl, a parent of an autistic son who is a member of the Miracle League, said when Deanna came to the dedication ceremony, she was above and beyond what they expected.
"I couldn't believe how long she stayed, even after her guard-type person tried to get her to go," she said, adding Favre stayed even after it started raining. "I really was impressed with how giving Deanna was of her own time in the lousy weather."
The Favres contributed $100,000 to the Miracle League — with part of it coming from their personal funds — allowing the group to build a concession stand and restroom area, Liegeois said.
"I was personally humbled," he said. "I was flattered to know they would be involved in something like that, and help see my dream project come to fruition."
Hopefully Favre will remain active in the community and continue the great impact she has made on the residents of the Greater Green Bay area, he said.
It's a hope Favre has as well, she said at a Thursday morning press conference where her husband took media questions about his retirement.
"It was very rewarding to be a part of this community and be a part of the charity work going on," she said. "The people here are very appreciative, grateful. I hope that it continues, but I don't think it will be the extent it has been."
Liegeois said Favre's contributions whether through money or visibility have been extraordinary.
"She is such a generous person," he said. "People can relate to her real-life situations and then try to give back to the community the way that she does."
Whatever the charity, or whatever the cause, Daniels said what the Favres contributed to the Green Bay community is something rare.
"The Favres didn't do what they did because they had to, they believed it was the right thing to do. They really believed that giving back to the community where they lived and worked was necessary and important," he said. "It was something they needed to do to make the community a better place."

Running Into the Night, and Traffic

Texto completo: It's almost midnight in Gowanus and 236 of New York City's fastest runners are lined up in the rain on a dark street. There are runners who have qualified for the Olympic Trials and track champions blocking the way of any vehicle out at that hour, as well as plenty of workaday running enthusiasts.
A garbage truck honks as racers get a briefing: there will be no barricades, no mile markers, no live bands -- we're a renegade band of running freaks on regular city streets.
"Know the route," shouts Joe DiNoto, the founder of Orchard Street Runners. "Keep it clean."
We bolt into the darkness. A construction worker screams as we cut through his work site, under backhoes and around gaping holes. Parts of the course are flooded, and everyone chases the leader, who is holding close to a sub-five-minute mile pace. The puddles being kicked up taste like industrial waste. We are one mile down, and with proper routing, twelve and change left. The infamous Midnight Half is underway.
More than 50,000 runners will take to the streets of New York Sunday, bounding across the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge for a 26.2 mile jaunt through the five boroughs. This midnight half-marathon is not that, but this run and the others I do each Tuesday night with this group offer inspiration that doesn't exist in sanctioned races with their closed courses and participation medals but reveals another running heartbeat of New York. Sometimes there's a little prize money -- $ 100 in a sweaty, crumpled envelope -- but no one is really here for that. The prize is street cred. Being fast isn't enough to take first place.
We have to know the streets, and more important, how they work. Aim for the center point of the approaching car and look beyond it to find a line. Be ready to jump. Watch rear vision mirrors for intent. Never make eye contact with New Yorkers when you're threading through a packed cross walk -- they panic and stop like prey. Never disturb the city's cadence. Use its flow. Find your line.
From a bird's-eye view, New York City appears to be the perfect grid. Planned, ordered, structured. But from our level, down here in the skinny streets between the tall buildings, among the rats and truck exhaust and endless sirens, it's chaos, even in the middle of the night. The world's most ambitious people working, walking, buying, driving, selling, riding -- the hustle -- with no concern for societal niceties. Get the hell out of the way, because their story is more important than yours.
Now throw the runner into the mix: you'll generally find them away from all that, out by the rivers, in the manicured parks, safely tucked away from the madness. Running groups meet at warm stores with doughnuts and coffee, with balloons and pace groups. It's easier.
For some of us, easy isn't what we seek.
We are a group of about two dozen slightly crazy people founded eight years ago by Joe DiNoto, a native New Yorker. Every Tuesday, we meet under a streetlamp on the Lower East Side, a swarm of tattoos, short shorts, and no bag check or small talk and lots of twitching muscles. We arrive armed with a knowledge of the route, posted on Instagram earlier in the day: a simple black and white photograph of the city with a white line snaking through the unmarked streets.
At 8 p.m. sharp, the group silently fans out into the street. The first four hundred meters is always easy, across Canal or Delancey Street, toward a bridge. Misfits amid the traffic, pacing with the cars, dodging pedestrians and cyclists as we blow through lights.
As we approach the bridge, we are rocks in a slingshot, being drawn slowly back, and then we're on it. In it. Breathing quickens, gaits open, the pace snaps. Hang on, I tell myself, but then I find myself out front, hauling a 5:30 pace up the bridge, and all I can hear is the pack of runners on my heel, chasing me down. I hold my phone over my shoulder and shoot some photographs.
We're alone in our pain, though on the best nights, I find myself a part of this swarm. We share a singular focus: that through this exercise of pushing the body to the very edge, we learn about the darkest canyons of our minds.
We aren't the fastest group in the city. We are raw, gritty, the antisocial kids at school, the addicts, the outcasts who found kindred spirits when we moved here. Normal, well-adjusted folks aren't running 240-mile races in the mountains of Utah, or sprinting through traffic against the advice of their loved ones for 14 miles on school nights.
I remember being utterly shattered at the end of a workout with Orchard Street Runners one night. I had failed to stay with the even slower, second group of runners. As I climbed the Manhattan Bridge alone, I was moved to tears by the view of New York. Strange, random things come into your mind when you've successfully crushed your spirit.
It's at this point that I remember why I adore all this. Running is easy. The brutality lies in overcoming the mind, forcing yourself to push beyond what your body claims is possible. 'Ease back', it says, 'it's not a race'. Screw you, I reply, often out loud, and move faster.
When death feels close, I picture Erik Reitinger, the group's captain, explaining his race strategy: "Suicide."
As I wind my way through the city's grid, the elements that can overwhelm start to fall into a system. Masses of people streaming out of offices and into subways, traffic clogging every street and avenue, lines for restaurants and velvet ropes outside bars and pop-up sales, the black S.U.V.s idling outside the banks on Wall Street. I used to find myself angered by it, the selfishness, the meaningless of it all. Now, I've found a rhythm to it. I no longer fight it; I use it.

When a Big Story Is Not the News

Texto completo: A few days ago, a listener named Tiffany wrote in with a suggestion.
"I love 'The Daily' -- great stuff! But why aren't all the episodes now about impeachment? Isn't that all we want to know about?"
A reasonable question. This is a historic moment. In modern American history, there have been only two other congressional votes to open an impeachment inquiry of a sitting president. House impeachment investigators are revealing startling new facts every day. And what began one month ago as a closed-door process is about to become highly public, through a series of open hearings, testimonies, disclosures and, eventually, an investigative report (the subject of today's episode).
We could, as Tiffany proposes, fill five shows a week with everything there is to know, explain and analyze about the impeachment process.
But we're not prepared to do that -- not at this point, anyway. "The Daily" is a news show, but our definition of news has, from the beginning, been deliberately broad. The news is as much what's happening in Syria, or inside the Food and Drug Administration, or within Boeing, as it is inside the U.S. Capitol.
Impeachment is, indisputably, a major story with enormous implications. But, on many days, the individual developments don't deepen or change our understanding of the story enough to fill an entire episode. So we're taking a creative approach to the subject: Our producers Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter recently spent the week in Washington, turning five days of developments into a single compelling episode.
When important news breaks in the impeachment story, we will put aside whatever we're working on and make a new episode, as we did last week, after a witness delivered what House Democrats called the most damning testimony yet against President Trump.
But this past week, four of our five episodes had nothing to do with impeachment. We examined the public health crisis surrounding vaping in a two-part series; explored the life and death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the founder of ISIS; and investigated what Boeing executives knew about the dangers of the 737 Max, and when they knew it.
As the impeachment inquiry enters an intensive new phase, it will inevitably become the subject of many episodes. Just not every episode.

What we still don't know about vaping
Our producer Alexandra Leigh Young on this week's vaping series, which was in the works for almost a year:
"It appeared on our list of potential episodes last winter, written on the whiteboard: JUUL/ALTRIA. One of the world's largest tobacco companies had invested more than $ 12 billion into the ostensibly anti-tobacco vaping company, and I couldn't get the news out of my head.
"By this spring, the episode idea was still on our list, but it had lost a word along the way. Now it was simply: JUUL. The idea was starting to morph. My younger cousins were telling me about kids who Juuled in the bathrooms at their high school. And suddenly, these mysterious lung illnesses started cropping up all over the country.
"By the end of the summer, vaping-related deaths were in the dozens. A friend said to me, "Yeah, but I don't vape bootleg stuff, so I'm fine." To me, it sounded more like, "I'm going to be O.K., right?" I didn't know what to tell him.
"As my questions grew, I got on the phone with our reporters Julie Bosman and Sheila Kaplan, and we decided we needed two episodes to cover the sprawling narrative. Part 1 would look at the medical mysteries, and Part 2 would tell the story of Juul.
"Two episodes don't feel like enough. This week, we received emails from listeners who, like my friend, wanted more clarification on the links between bootleg products, THC vapes and nicotine vapes. But as we said in the series, this is just the beginning of a public health crisis. The C.D.C. still doesn't know what exactly is causing these illnesses and deaths. And so a new episode idea popped up on my story list this week. It reads: BOOTLEG VAPING."

What we're watching
Who: Bianca Giaever, audio producer
What: "The Show About the Show," a metadocumentary series
For years I have begged and pleaded with my friends and family to watch my favorite show. "Where do we find it?" They asked me. "Netflix? Hulu?"
"No," I tell them. "The greatest show of our time is sponsored by BRIC TV, a Brooklyn nonprofit. And it's only available on YouTube."
Not very many of my friends have seen it. This week, however, my tiny beloved show was featured in The New York Times Magazine, and I feel like a proud parent. The filmmaker is named Caveh Zahedi. (Disclaimer: I was such a fan of the show that I tracked Caveh down a couple of years ago and befriended him.)
Each episode of "The Show About the Show" is about the making of the previous episode. (You might need to read that sentence a few times.) Imagine reality television, but flawlessly executed by a radically honest performance artist. In the show, Caveh combines camera monologues, documentary footage and re-enactments to chronicle the struggles of everyday life.
"You're gonna have to choose between the show or our family," Caveh's wife eventually says to him in Season 1, when she felt that the show had gone too far. They had been married for 16 years, but Caveh chose the show. Then he documented their breakup.

Texto completo: CLEARWATER  Jamie Bennett never thought in her lifetime that she would see the day when Boy Scouts would admit girls.

But when she heard the change was coming, she jumped on the opportunity to start a female troop before Boy Scouts of America made it official in October 2017.

The historic change after more than 100 years meant girls could now join the Cub Scout program for children ages 5 to 10, and they could achieve the coveted Eagle Scout rank in its older Boy Scouts program, which was changed to Scouts BSA to welcome boys and girls ages 11 to 17.

Bennett, 48, immediately began gathering everything required for approved from the council  a signed charter agreement, at least five youth and adult applications, fees, committee members, and youth protection certificates.

As a daughter of an Eagle Scout, the highest rank, and a mother of three who has been heavily involved in Boy Scouts leadership for 10 years with her two sons, she witnessed its benefits on boys and thought girls deserved the same.

It just makes sense, Bennett said. There are so many life skills that are taught throughout scouting, that it doesnt matter what your gender is.

On Feb. 7, Bennett welcomed 10 girls to the first meeting for Troop 135, one of the first all-female troops in Tampa Bay and the only one of 65 troops in the Miccosukee (North Pinellas County District), at the Heritage United Methodist Church in Clearwater.

The girls program is exactly the same as the boys.

They wear the same tan and olive green uniforms, learn from

the same Scout book, lead their meetings like the boys, and they even meet at the same place, and at the same time. They are just in separate rooms.

There are a few occasions when the two troops unite, such as training and summer camp.

District executive Ryan Cooper anticipates about four more female troops will start in January.

Many others have tried to start a female unit but havent seen success because they either cannot secure a leader, they have trouble recruiting girls at an age when many are already involved in sports, dance, cheerleading or gymnastics, or their charter organizations vetoed the idea of accepting girls into Boy Scouts.

With girls just starting this year, its a tester year even though its official, Cooper said.

Being that they are girls, they have to have a female leader. Thats a national policy. But getting leadership is difficult in itself. Youre asking parents that already have kids, already have jobs, and already have things on their plate to dedicate more time to help run a program. And since the program is new to girls, its harder to find girls to be a part of a program they had no interaction with prior.

But luckily for Bennett, her ties to Boys Scouts paid off.

All but one of her Scouts had brothers in Boys Scouts, so word of mouth, a newsletter announcement, and a Facebook post connected her with girls and their families already interested in joining.

Isabella Fitzpatrick is the one Scout without a brother but still, she is no stranger to Scouting. She frequently heard stories from her father, who is an Eagle Scout, about the program. As someone who loves the outdoors, she was fascinated with his stories about his adventures fishing, woodcarving, and camping.

At the time, she could only dream of recreating some of her fathers experiences.

I always wanted to be a Boy Scout, she said, but I never thought itd be possible.

So instead, Fitzpatrick, 13, joined Girl Scouts. But she left once her family got word of this female troop developing in their area.

Finally, she thought, her dreams would come true.

Fitzpatricks situation highlights a longstanding feud between Girl Scouts U.S.A. and Boy Scouts of America.

According to a 2017 New York Times report, Kathy Hopinkah Hannan, the president of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., wrote a letter to her counterpart, Randall Stephenson of the Boy Scouts, accusing the organization of trying to undercut the Girl Scouts through a covert campaign to recruit girls. In the letter, Hannan formally requested that they stay focused on serving the 90 percent of American boys not currently participating in Boy Scouts.

The move caused tension between two organizations that once had an amicable relationship.

The tension spread locally, too.

We are going after a different girl, Bennett said. Were going after the girl that wants to be outside, getting her hands dirty, learning outdoor skills, playing with hatchets and knives.

But Jessica Muroff, the CEO of Girl Scouts of West Central Florida, thinks many people have the wrong idea about Girl Scouts.

This is one of the most common misconceptions is that we dont have the same outside activities for girls, she said.

If you put our programs side by side we offer some of the same if not more activities for girls at a younger age.

Some of these programs Muroff references include overnight camping, archery, and high ropes challenge courses that girls can explore beginning in the first grade.

The Girl Scouts and some charter organizations werent the only ones that did not embrace the change.

Bennett said occasionally she had to prepare the girls when they went out in public to ignore rude remarks and confusion.

She remembers taking them out for the first time in their uniforms to sell hot chocolate at Largo Central Parks Christmas Lights celebration and people stared at them, gave them weird looks or said: go join Girl Scouts.

Aside from that, the female unit has received minimal opposition. It just took Bennett explaining to some of the boys parents, who were skeptical at first that it would affect the boys troops, that the troops would be separate.

Troop 135 meets every Thursday to play games, learn key skills from their Scout book and plan activities and camps. They are currently planning a three-day trip to NASA next year.

Trump files to become Palm Beach resident

Texto completo: PALM BEACH — President Donald Trump plans to be a permanent resident of Mar-a-Lago, according to a document he filed this month in Palm Beach County Court.
Trump filed an affidavit Oct. 4 to change his primary domicile to 1100 S. Ocean Blvd., the address of the mansion he converted into a country club and where he's stayed numerous times since his November 2016 election.
The “Declaration of Domicile” form bearing the president's signature was dated Sept. 27 and notarized in Washington, D.C.
It said Mar-a-Lago "constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such."
The form says he formerly resided at 721 Fifth Ave. in Manhattan, the address of Trump Tower.
The first lady, Melania Trump, simultaneously filed the same form.
Their documents each list two "other places of abode" — Trump's summer retreat in New Jersey, and the White House. The New York Times first reported on the forms Thursday evening.
A tally shows that since Trump became president, he has spent all or part of 99 days in Palm Beach over 24 visits. He last visited during the Easter holiday in late April and is expected to return for Thanksgiving, as he did in 2018.
He planned a 17-day stay during the 2018-19 Christmas-New Year holidays, but stayed in Washington because of the 35-day federal government shutdown.
Mar-a-Lago — Spanish for "sea to lake" — sits on 17 acres spanning the island from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway.
The estate was built Marjorie Merriweather Post, who inherited $11 million from her father, Charles William Post, who built the breakfast cereal empire. She spent $2.5 million in 1920s dollars on the construction.
Completed in 1927, Mar-a-Lago featured 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms with gold fixtures, three bomb shelters, an 1,800-square-foot living room (with gold leaf on its 42-foot ceilings), a 1,500-square-foot dining room, a theater, a 75-foot tower, 36,000 antique Spanish tiles and a nine-hole golf course.
In 1964, Post offered Mar-a-Lago to the state, which balked at the $250,000 overhead. When she died in 1973, she willed it to the federal government as a winter White House. The estate remained dormant, and seven years later the government gave it back to Post’s heirs.
In 1985, Trump paid $15 million for the mansion and its furnishings. He restored the home and built a putting green, tennis courts and croquet court, then added a spa, salon and health club.
Bemoaning the massive upkeep, Trump in 1995 converted Mar-a-Lago into a private club. It often rents out space for high-profile charity balls and other galas.

Biden comes in fourth place in Iowa poll as Buttigieg rises

Texto completo: Joe Biden came in fourth place in a poll of likely Iowa Democratic caucuses voters released Friday, adding to signs that the former vice president and the one-time front-runner is in danger of showing poorly in the first-in-the-nation state nominating contest.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren led the field in the New York Times/Siena College Iowa poll released Friday, with 22% support, followed by Vermont Sen. Sanders at 19%, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 18%, and Biden at 17%.
Biden's campaign staff has tempered expectations about him winning Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating contests in the Democratic presidential primary, instead turning focus to South Carolina, where he maintains a lead, and Super Tuesday states. Iowa officials who have endorsed Biden are worried about his campaign's attitude toward the state and cite the state director not living Iowa as one reason for his fragile position in the race.
The poll pushed Biden to third place in the RealClearPolitics average of primary polls in Iowa, which finds Warren at 22.3%, Buttigieg at 17%, Biden at 15.7%, and Sanders at 15.3%. Biden led in the average by up to 10.5 points through mid-September, but then Warren began to pass him in many polls.
Meanwhile, Buttigieg has emerged as a prominent alternative to Biden for Democrats uncomfortable with ultra-progressive Sanders or Warren leading the ticket in 2020 as Biden's flailing in the polls and lackluster fundraising sparks worries about whether Biden is electable enough to beat President Trump.
The poll also spells trouble for California Sen. Kamala Harris, who this week laid off many of her national campaign staff and redirected attention and resources to Iowa. She got 3% support in the poll, tied for sixth place with tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar was in fifth place with 4% support.
Friday's poll is the first Iowa poll conducted by New York Times/Siena College in the 2020 Democratic primary. It surveyed 439 likely Democratic caucus voters in Iowa from Oct. 25-30 and has a margin of error of 4.7 points.

Texto completo: President Trump legally changed his primary residence from New York, where he's spent most of his life, to Florida back in September.
The president and first lady both filed a "declaration of domicile," saying that their Mar-a-Lago club, their resort in West Palm Beach, Florida, will be their permanent residence, the New York Times first reported.
Trump said on Twitter that he "cherish[es] New York" and the people but pointed to paying "millions of dollars in city, state and local taxes each year" and being "treated very badly by the political leaders" as the reason behind his move.TweetTrump's change in residence is not expected to affect the subpoena filed by Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, meant to obtain the president's tax returns. Trump has attempted to thwart Vance Jr.'s investigation with a federal lawsuit.
The move could keep more money in Trump's pockets because Florida does not have a state income tax or inheritance tax.
Throughout the first three years of his presidency, Trump has spent 99 days at his Mar-a-Lago resort compared to 20 days at Trump Tower, his New York residence, according to NBC News.
Following the news, many took to social media to comment on the president's residency switch.Tweet

'Whiteness'

Información de publicación: Washington Examiner ; Washington, D.C. [Washington, D.C]. 31 Oct 2019.

Texto completo: I have observed with a sort of low-grade alarm the evolution of the woke usages of the word “white.” Notable notches on the timeline include the old, semi-ironic use of “that’s so white” to mean so square, which at some point melted into constant acknowledgments and only-sometimes-instructive invocations of “white privilege.” And then “white” accrued a suffix, leading to the abstract noun “whiteness.” A little while back, if you hung around a certain class of overeducated people, some instances of white privilege might be held up along with the instruction to “watch whiteness work.”
So, casual anti-white racism is a core part of the radical chic verbal fashion sense. Fine. As far as it goes, this is not some horrible racial injustice against whites. White Americans are not in any serious danger of being laid low by organized prejudice. I’m white, and I’m certainly not put out by it. My only practical concern here is that the cultural conversation at large emphasizing white identity might cause certain kinds of bitter and vulnerable white people to emphasize their white identity with tattoos and torches and such. Really not a fan of that.
The latest evolution in wording whiteness, however, alarmed me more seriously. In a New York Times article titled “A Racist Attack Shows How Whiteness Evolves,” Dr. Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People, has turned “white” into, as my second-grade teacher taught me to describe verbs, an “action word.” He describes a racist attack in New Jersey in which two boys of Indian descent allegedly attacked four African American girls while using racial slurs.
This is horrible, but it does not really raise any scholarly questions. Painter disagrees. He finds in it an opportunity for some racial theorizing about the essence of what race, and specifically whiteness, is: “Instead of asking what the boys’ reported racial identity tells us about the nature of the attack, we should see the boys as enacting American whiteness through anti-black assault in a very traditional way. In doing so, the assailants are demonstrating how race is a social construct that people make through their actions. They show race in the making, and show how race is something we perform, not just something we are in our blood or in the color of our skin.”
The verb-phrase “enacting whiteness” is such an academese syntactical abomination that I struggle to type it. I suppose he couldn’t have gone with “whitening” because of the dental meaning, but really. Painter, scamming at the level of Tom Sawyer doing some whitewashing, is trying to argue that to be white is to be racist, and that to be racist is to be white. Is a white person who is not presently in the middle of being racist against black people not, in that moment, white, since said honky is not “enacting whiteness” just then? Seems questionable. But, invoking a “traditional black/white binary” that we have to find a way to fit everyone into, Painter suggests “we should observe their actions. Or how they perform race.”
Well, somebody here is performing. All I can reply is that if your idea of whiteness includes nonwhite people, you’ve thought about this a creepy amount, and it has broken your common sense. Take a step back. Don’t watch whiteness work. Watch TV or something.

Texto completo: Un Dreamer lucha para frenar la deportación de su madre, una paciente de cáncer en etapa cuatro.
De acuerdo con New York Times, la hondureña Tania Romero se encuentra bajo custodia de ICE después de ser detenida en el tráfico en el condado de Gwinnett en Georgia . La mujer tenía orden de deportación desde 2008 por no asistir a sus audiencias en una orden de inmigración.
Sin embargo, su hijo Cristian Padilla Romero probó que la mujer de 48 años nunca recibió las citaciones. Los sobres fueron devueltos a ICE por el Servicio Postal del Estados Unidos .
El joven es un estudiante de doctorado en la prestigiosa Universidad de Yale. Desde allí ha promovido una campaña para frenar la deportación de su madre y costear los gastos médicos de su tratamiento para el cáncer oral.
Relacionado: Pequeño detalle lo salvó de la deportación y le dio la residencia. Pero ahora le pedían $100,000
“Me guió, trabajó en tres empleos para mantenerme”, dijo Padilla, quien llegó a Estados Unidos a los siete años, al Times. “Mi madre es la principal razón por la que voy a Yale”.
El inmigrante, que también es indocumentado pero protegido por el DACA, también ha denunciado que su madre no ha recibido la atención médica que su madre requiere en este momento.
Romero cruzó la frontera ilegalmente hace unos 20 años . Ha trabajado limpiando casas, lavando platos y en construcción.
ICE dijo al Times que por privacidad no puede hablar del caso.

Texto completo: "It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised."
Ken Rosenberg
Applied conservation scientist, Cornell University
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife. Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds."
Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell
When a team of Cornell University researchers and others published a bird study in the online journal Science on Sept. 19, they didn't expect the worldwide reaction that followed.
The findings: North America has lost 2.9 billion birds in the past 50 years — 29% of the avian population.
The impact: An ecosystem is losing a key component and it's a sign of a quickly changing environment that will affect other wildlife, plants and more.
The spotlight: Once the study was released, the New York Times picked up the story and highlighted a startling statement from David Yarnold, president and chief executive of the National Audubon Society, who called the findings "a full-blown crisis." Other major media outlets picked up the story, and conservationists around the world were shocked and inspired to take action.
"The reaction to the study has been phenomenal. We were hoping for a big response," said Ken Rosenberg, an applied conservation scientist at Cornell, the study's lead author and a leader of research and planning on joint initiatives by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology Lab and the American Bird Conservancy.
"We expected some response, but this is the biggest thing we've seen for a bird paper. It was amazing to see the findings on the front page of the New York Times and the Washington Post. All of networks talking birds for one day was so great. The trick now is how to keep the interest and keep the momentum going so it is not a headline that disappears."
From Ithaca and beyond To publish the study, the team of scientists tracked birds for decades, and parts of the study came from Ithaca's backyards and skies, as countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers submitted their observations to databases and helped carry out studies of bird populations every year.
Some of the most fascinating parts of the study came from weather radar maps as the researches found some types of birds were declining in population, but others, such as waterfowl and raptors, were increasing in numbers.
"It was quite overwhelming," said Adriaan Dokter, a research associate at Cornell. "It reached Europe, too. It went all over the world. It was more than what we expected."
Dokter noted he and Rosenberg were interviewed by Australian, Dutch and Spanish media.
"People see this trend not just here, but in Europe," Dokter said. "It's not just a local U.S. phenomenon, but a trend all over the world."
To Dokter, the confirmation of the population decrease across hundreds of bird species is like a canary in a coal mine.
"It's a decrease in the vitality of the ecosystem that we see. Birds depend on insects. Insects are important to the ecosystem of plants," he said. "It means something fundamental in our environment ... It's a warning sign that we have to be careful. Things are rapidly changing."
How scientists researched the decline in birds Surveying: Scientists and amateurs observed birds to complete censuses.
Weather radar: Scientists examined weather radar maps to determine the cumulative weight of birds in the sky.
Research: Researchers examined hundreds of different surveys.
Analysis: After finding the best data from the surveys, scientists conducted statistical analyses to determine how much populations have decreased.
The team at Cornell partnered with the American Bird Conservancy, National Audubon Society, Bird Conservancy of the Rockies, Canadian Wildlife Service, the Georgetown University Georgetown Environment Initiative, United States Geological Survey and the Smithsonian National Zoological Park Conservation Biology Institute.
"'Were there declines or shifts?'" Rosenberg said about the questions researchers had years ago. "Someone never did this comprehensive work."
Researchers then obtained answers they were searching for — there's been an overall decline in the bird population, and the largest declines have been in the most common species.
"It was a shock at first, but maybe we should not have been surprised," Rosenberg said.
Using weather radar, Dokter was able to pick up the cumulative weights of birds migrating, which he later analyzed. The birds he researched tended to be long-distance migratory birds, which contribute more to the bio-life on radar maps.
"The U.S. has a very large network of radars that cover ... anything in the sky — not just weather, but also wildlife," Dokter said. "Birds give strong signals. More and more have realized this, and it's an important data source for biologists. If you look at it on your iPhone, you don't see the individual bird, but a blob of bio-life moving. That's what is used for birds.
"We don't see the numbers, but the kilograms of birds in the skies. What we did see recently is the amount of migration that has changed. It's a nice complement to what's seen on ground. Radar gives really good coverage. With radar, we can count many more birds than what we could count on the ground."
Bird biomass in the skies has decreased by about 14% since 2007, Dokter told the Cornell Chronicle, Cornell University's in-house publication.
"The decline in night skies might be steeper than what we see on the ground. It's migratory birds, especially birds that travel long distance ... they seem to be not doing too well," Dokter said. "It's what I want to document next, and the why and what we can do to turn it around. Where do they face the most problems and challenges?"
Outside of weather radar data, scientists looked through more than 500 surveys, Rosenberg said. They then used a statistical model to analyze the data.
Locals get involved in tracking bird population The primary data source was the North American Breeding Bird Survey, which started in 1966 as a collaboration between scientists and bird-watchers.
While there have been studies on the changes of bird populations on the continent, the most recent study was the first time anyone has ever collected and analyzed 50 years' worth of data and findings in North America.
For decades, countless passionate non-professional bird-watchers have submitted their observations to databases. In the new research, professionals examined those studies to estimate the populations of 529 species from 2006 to 2015.
"The study published in Science was shocking to me, with its report of just how deeply bird populations have crashed since 1970," said Diane Morton, president of the Cayuga Bird Club. "The paper let us know that it is not just our subjective impression that there are fewer birds now, but that hundreds of different bird species really are much, much less abundant than they used to be.
"Among other alarming declines, the authors reported that forest birds like warblers, and grassland species like meadowlarks and sparrows, now number hundreds of millions fewer than in the 1970s."
The Cayuga Bird Club's annual Christmas Bird Count contributed to the findings. In addition, the club also counts birds for the New York State Breeding Bird Atlas.
"It was rewarding for those of us who participate in the annual Christmas Bird Count to know that the numbers we gather in our bird counts year after year were useful for these analyses," Morton said. "We did not provide any direct input, but our participation in citizen science projects generated some of the data that this extensive study used."
Surveys by Rosenberg and other local scientists contributed as well.
"The birders are the eyes of the world," he said. "You need to have all the eyes and ears out there because scientists can't do it alone. But it's not just the observation of amateurs. It's data collected for the purpose of the survey."
Birds that have seen the largest decrease The research shows most of the birds lost belong to 12 families, including warblers, finches, sparrows and swallows.
Birds associated with farmlands have seen the largest decline in numbers and percentage.
"Some birds in our backyards are the steepest in decline that we see," Dokter said. "Hopefully, it will lead to action take care of nature."
Out of all of the bird families, the largest decline was among larks.
There are 70 million fewer Eastern meadowlarks, 60 million fewer Western meadowlarks, and a 67% decline for all larks.
"We're seeing this loss of abundance, because birds are integral parts of ecosystems. They perform ecological functions like seed dispersal," Rosenberg said.
"The loss of this chunk of birds is causing ecological consequences. Because we have this data on birds, the fear that is happening with birds is happening across the board with other animals."
What's being done for North American birds The National Audubon Society has responded strongly to the report and is mobilizing its 1.65 million members to urge lawmakers to act on bird conservation.
The organization is pushing for the passing of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act and implementation of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Both plans focus on providing an optimal environment and water for birds in the regions.
The group also wants lawmakers to defend and reinforce the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which the Trump administration has been trying to weaken. Conservationists say the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects close to 1,000 species of North American birds and is the most import bird conservation law in the U.S.
What's next for the bird population The Cayuga Bird Club will census birds for the next New York Breeding Bird Atlas, which will have five years of surveys starting from January 2020.
"The Science paper is a call to action," Morton said. "It has sparked more urgent discussion about how to address the decline of bird populations — through conservation management, changing the developed landscape to provide better habitat for birds, and taking individual steps to reduce the threats that birds face. Continued monitoring of bird populations will also be important for prioritizing conservation efforts."
Because the study did not state the reasons for the decrease in bird populations, Rosenberg said he and the researchers are assembling a group of experts early next year to investigate the causes of the declines.
"The most important thing is that this doesn't become a news flash," Rosenberg said "We want people to pay attention and to track birds. People who love birds have to speak up. ... We won't reverse the declines unless people who love birds demand action."

Texto completo: ARCADIA, Calif. — Craig Fravel sat down in front of the grandstands at Santa Anita Park as he looked across the famed racetrack and into the distance.
“Sitting here at the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, you can see why this is such a great venue for the Breeders’ Cup,’’ Fravel, CEO and president of the Breeders’ Cup, told USA TODAY Sports this week. “It’s a spectacularly beautiful place. ”
Yet it’s also fraught with tension and scrutiny as the annual two-day horse racing event is set to begin Friday.
The 36th running of the Breeders’ Cup, 14 races with purses of no less than $1 million each that culminate with the $6 million Breeders' Cup Classic,has attracted many of the sport’s top horses. It's also certain to attract protesters decrying a string of horse deaths at Santa Anita — 36 deaths since December.
The deaths have activated animal rights groups such as PETA and led to an investigation by the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office.
Yet in June, with a chance to move the Breeders’ Cup to famed Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky or another racetrack, the organization’s board of directors voted to keep the event at Santa Anita, which will be hosting the Breeders’ Cup for a record 10th time.
Fravel has dismissed the idea that his accepting a new job with the Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita Park, influenced the Breeders’ Cup board’s decision to keep the event here.
'IT'S JUST A JOB TO ME': Horses go from racetracks to slaughterhouses
INVESTIGATION: Horse racing deaths mount as states spend billions to keep tracks alive
“It wasn’t really that hard a decision because it was the right thing to do and we needed to acknowledge people were taking the right kind of steps that we believe are important for the whole industry to take,’’ said Fravel, who after the Breeders' Cup will become CEO of racing operations for the Stronach Group, which owns six other thoroughbred racing tracks.
Unable to slow the alarming rate of horse deaths, Santa Anita shut down racing for almost all of March. Two experts were brought in to inspect the track. The Stronach Group later announced the track was deemed fit to resume racing.
Reform followed.
The use of race-day medication was banned with the exception of Lasix, and the Stronach Group has committed to phasing out permitted use of the potent diuretic. Jockeys faced new restrictions on the use of whips.
Dionne Benson, chief veterinary officer for the Stronach Group, said Santa Anita has reduced horse fatalities by almost 80% at its training track and by more than 50% on the racing track since the track reopened in late March. She cited Santa Anita increasing oversight and control as factors.
"From my perspective, that isn't the finish line,'' she said, referring to the reduced rate of deaths. "Our finish line is zero (deaths). That is our goal. We may never reach it.
"But every time we have an incident, every time we have any kind of injury to a horse, we need to figure out if there's a way it could have been prevented. ''
Toward that end, Benson said, the Stronach Group is investing in new medical technology for horses and will continue to work on regulatory, technology and education issues as "three ways to address any injury that we have with horses. ''
Despite racing reforms at Santa Anita and throughout the state, Gov. Gavin Newsom in September put California horse racing on notice during an interview with the New York Times.
“I’ll tell you, talk about a sport whose time is up unless they reform,’’ Newsom told the Times. “That’s horse racing. Incredible abuses to these precious animals and the willingness to just to spit these animals out and literally take their lives is a disgrace. ”
In addition to the horse deaths, Newsom pointed to another troubling matter: In September, the New York Times reported that Justify, winner of the 2018 Triple Crown, failed a drug test after winning the Santa Anita Derby — a victory that preceded the horse’s sweeping the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Yet California horse racing regulators disposed of the inquiry behind closed doors, the New York Times reported.
Earlier this week, Jim Gagliano, president and chief operating officer of the Jockey Club, said the sport of horse racing is facing a reckoning.
“Safety and integrity, those are fundamental matters for any sporting competition,’’ said Gagliano, who is helping spearhead a push for federal legislation — the Horse Racing Integrity Act — that would establish a central body responsible for drug testing horses. “This is a gambling sport. Integrity has to be of the highest variety. ’’
But reality has cast a shadow over talk of reforms. During buildup to the 2019 Breeders’ Cup, the horse death toll at Santa Anita continued to mount.
On Oct. 25, G Q Covergirl, a six-year-old mare, was euthanized after injuring her front legs while on the training track. On Sunday, Bye Bye Beautiful, a 2-year-old filly, was euthanized after she injured her front right leg during a race.
“Like I've been arguing for a long time, they can't stop the killing,’’ Patrick Battuello, an animal rights activist focused on the death of racehorses, said. "It's built in to the system. "
Yet Fravel, wearing a purple Breeders’ Cup sweatshirt as he sat in front of the Santa Anita grandstands earlier this week, looked serene with the view of the San Gabriel Mountains in the distance.
“I take comfort in the fact that we’ve done everything that we can to control the controllable,’’ Fravel said. “What misfortune could occur that we can’t avoid, I worry about it but that’s just because I’m a worrier, not because we haven’t done everything we can do to address it. ’’

Texto completo: SIMSBURY - Currently, Simsbury's five-member Board of Selectmen includes only one woman. But next week, that could change.
For the Nov. 5 municipal elections, the local Republicans have put forward a slate that, including down-ballot candidates, has more women than men.
This includes Cheryl Cook, who is currently the sole female member of the Board of Selectmen. In next week's election, Cook will vie for the top elected seat in town: first selectman.
Cook said that no one, including herself, at first noticed that she was the only successful female candidate in the 2017 election, when she won her second two-year term on the Board of Selectmen.
"People really didn't realize it had happened until it did," Cook said. "It really wasn't even on the radar."
Cook hopes to see more women running for office, which would give the elected boards another perspective to consider.
Both the Democrats and the Republicans have nominated a slate of candidates for the town's boards, including the education board, finance board, the planning commission and others.
The Board of Selectmen, however, is the highest board in the town.
The Democratic candidates for the Board of Selectmen are:
*Incumbent Eric Wellman for first selectman
* Incumbent Chris Peterson
* Newcomer Philip Purciello, who previously ran as a Republican
* Newcomer Wendy Mackstutis
The Republican candidates for Board of Selectmen are:
* Cheryl Cook for first selectman
* Newcomer Jackie Battos
* Incumbent Sean Askham
* Incumbent Mike Paine
In addition, petitioning candidate Robert Kalechman is also running for first selectman.
Cook and Battos, the two Republican women running for the Board of Selectmen, said that the current board does its job well.
More women on the board would give the board more viewpoints to draw from, they both said.
"The Board of Selectmen is fantastic, they do a great job," Battos said. "It's (about) another voice and having another voice."
Despite the composition of the town's highest elected board, the town of Simsbury is run by only men.
On the career side of the coin, the town has three high-ranking female executives in town manager Maria Capriola, deputy town manager Melissa Appleby and finance director Amy Meriwether.
Cook and Battos said local woman are also already involved in town happenings, particularly in volunteer positions that keep the town operating smoothly.
"There are women who have been involved in town for a long time," Cook said. But "it takes some courage to put your name on the ballot and I understand that."
As The New York Times reported in 2018, female politicians are subjected to all kinds of verbal abuse, sometimes including credible threats of violence.
At a 2018 meeting organized by UN Women, one expert presented a study showing, of women in parliaments across 39 countries, nearly 82 percent "experienced psychological violence."
Although those issues are often tamer in municipal elections, the problem still exists.
Cook, who has already sat on the Board of Selectmen for about six years, said that the vitriol directed at her has intensified now that's running for first selectman. That's especially true online, she said.
"People feel a lot freer to say things online that they would probably never say to your face," Cook said. "You don't want to put an emotional face on it but sometimes it does hurt."
Mackstutis, the Democratic woman running for the Board of Selectmen, said she's been targeted by some "trolls" online since announcing her candidacy.
Mackstutis said the trolls have directed about the same amount of anger at her as they direct at First Selectman Wellman - but Wellman is already sitting in an elected position, a step above the position that Mackstutis is seeking.
"Social media does impact you at the local level, which was a surprise to me," Mackstutis said.
For the highest position in town, first selectman, there's a three-way race.
Wellman - the Democrat who's currently in his first term as first selectman, after winning an underdog race in 2017 - said that he would focus a second term on continuing the economic development, extending the East Coast Greenway and making the town more efficient.
He also noted that Simsbury is still in a state of transition, after moving to the town manager style of government about two years ago.
"This is a journey we're on. We've had more change in two years in our local government than in probably any other two-year period in anyone's memory," Wellman said.
Cook, the Republican candidate for first selectman, said she sees herself as a policy maker.
If elected first selectman, Cook said, she would focus on supporting initiatives that assist people who are in recovery from addiction. She would also look to expand local transportation options, which she said is especially important as the town's population ages.
"There's a lot of things swirling around, but I am really committed to doing this as a full-time job if I'm elected," Cook said.
Kalechman, the petitioning candidate for first selectmen, said his first priority would be to address high taxes affecting Simsbury residents. He also said he's opposed to the Curaleaf production facility on Hopmeadow Street. Curaleaf is one of a handful of licensed cannabis growers in the state.
"We have no leadership in town. The people do not have a voice," Kalechman said.

Pedestrians in the crosshairs

Texto completo: The dark season is upon us again, and the terrors it holds are hardly confined to Halloween. Low visibility combined with the inclement weather that is surely just around the calendar corner in our part of the world pose increased traffic safety risks.
This reflection is prompted by statistics reported last week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: More pedestrians and bicyclists were killed in 2018 than in any year since 1990, even as total traffic deaths decreased. The NHTSA said that 6,283 pedestrians were killed last year, an increase of 3.4% from 2017, while 857 bicyclists died, an increase of 6.3%. Combined, those two categories accounted for about 20% of all traffic deaths.
The agency also noted that the overall traffic safety picture has been improving for the past 40 years, as manufacturers have added features such as air bags and electronic stability control, and public awareness campaigns have led to increased seat belt use and decreased impaired driving.
So why are “outside of vehicle” fatalities spiking?
Experts interviewed by The New York Times pointed to the driving public’s taste for larger SUVs and trucks, which are more prone to running over pedestrians rather than throwing them up over the hood. This, combined with the heavier impact imparted during a collision and larger blind spots, may be contributing to more such deaths, they surmised.
This is not to mention the dangers inherent in distracted driving. About 3.2% of drivers on the road on a given day are using cellphones, according to the Times. (We also wonder about distracted walking, having seen on more than a couple of occasions in Hanover pedestrians who were blissfully unaware that they were straying out into traffic while using their phones.)
And, now, about that darkness, which poses special challenges to aging eyes, of which there are many in Vermont and New Hampshire. (The percentage of drivers 65 and older involved in fatal crashes has increased nearly 35% over 10 years.)
Nighttime fatalities involving pedestrians rose 4.6% from 2017 to 2018, while those involving bicyclists went up 9.2%. This may be an unfortunate side effect of an otherwise positive development: More people are walking and biking for health and environmental reasons, a trend certainly noticeable in the Upper Valley.
Something else that is quite evident to us is that reckless driving is spiking rapidly here. For instance, the morning commute on Interstate 89 often resembles nothing so much as the Wild West, combining high speed, immense pickup trucks and SUVs, unsignaled lane changes and a general aggression previously associated primarily with neighboring states to the south. If that kind of driving spills over to roads frequented by pedestrians and bicyclists, it constitutes a distinct menace to them.
So, drivers, on Halloween night, when children are more likely to be walking about than usual, be extra careful. And, then, resolve to drive in like fashion every subsequent night, and day, sharing the road safely with walkers and bicyclists. If you need a refresher on how to do that, the NHTSA website — https://www.nhtsa.gov/road-safety/pedestrian-safety — has useful safety tips for both drivers and pedestrians, who also need to know how best to protect themselves from injury or death.

Texto completo: Readers praise the colonel who gave testimony before Congress as a patriot and hero.
To the Editor:
Re "Colonel Tried to Fill Gaps in Ukraine Call Transcript" (front page, Oct. 30):
I read Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman's opening statement before the House Committees on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight. Can there be a more overwhelmingly compelling statement of what happened between Ukrainian and American officials?
Colonel Vindman came to this country at age 3 from Ukraine. He wanted nothing more than to serve the United States, and he has in myriad ways. He states that he is -- and certainly sounds -- utterly nonpartisan.
During a July 10 meeting with Oleksandr Danylyuk, a senior government official from Ukraine, Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, talked about the need to deliver "specific investigations" in order to secure a meeting with President Trump.
After that meeting, according to Colonel Vindman's testimony, "I stated to Amb. Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security, and that such investigations were not something the N.S.C. was going to get involved in or push."
Colonel Vindman's testimony is devastating. Can anyone find otherwise?

To the Editor:
If a young person wonders whether his government can be trusted, if a dispirited citizen is unsure her country is worth loving, if an immigrant asks what America stands for, they have only to look at the photograph of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman going to testify in the Capitol to know the answer.
Here is the epitome of public service, a person who knows what truth, honor and duty mean and why they matter. This is what patriotism looks like, what courage consists of, what a hero is. Colonel Vindman continues his work of defending and protecting our nation. His example gives the inspiration we need. His action renews our faith that one person can make a difference, that sunlight will break the darkness. Thank you, sir.

Re "On Far Right, Pundits Stoke Conspiracies on Witness" (news article, Oct. 30):
Look at all the medals and ribbons on the uniform of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, and then consider how vile and desperate Fox News and right-wing commentators are to stoop so low as to challenge this hero's loyalty to the United States. Have you folks no decency?

Thomas L. Friedman: Trump, Zuckerberg &amp; pals are breaking America

Texto completo: If America’s worst enemies had spent years designing a plan to erode our greatest strengths, they could not have done better than what some of our fellow citizens are doing to the country every day for short-term financial or political gain.
Prominent figures in government, politics and commerce are behaving in ways that are so destructive of the core institutions and norms that underpin our democracy, one can only assume that they take the country’s stability as a given — that they can abuse and stress it all they want and it won’t break.
They are wrong. We can break America, and right now we’re on our way there. Not in the Cold War, not during Vietnam, not during Watergate did I ever fear more for my country.
This moment “is like Wall Street before the financial crisis, when everyone just took for granted that the system was forever stable,” remarked Gautam Mukunda, research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School and author of “Indispensable: When Leaders Really Matter.”
“So they kept taking bigger and bigger risks and pushing it harder and harder — until they pushed too hard and it crashed and the government had to step in and rescue everyone. If they keep acting like this, Trump and his allies will keep getting short-term wins until the system crashes. Only there won’t be any government to step in and rescue them, because they’ll have broken it — and the country along with it.”
What am I talking about? I’m talking about a president willing to sink to banana republic governing norms, including withholding aid to Ukraine to compel its leadership to investigate his political rival.
I’m talking about Republican lawmakers who know that the president’s Ukraine machinations are indefensible and impeachable, particularly after Tuesday’s disclosures by Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine expert on the National Security Council, that he personally heard President Donald Trump appeal to Ukraine’s president to investigate Joe Biden.
Republicans now have a clear choice: let the constitutional impeachment process proceed or attack the process, i.e., our legislative-judicial order. Alas, a majority seem to be opting for the latter.
They justify it with daily new conspiracy theories amplified by Fox News. They even stormed a secure room in the Capitol to mislead the public into thinking these hearings are totally one-sided — when in fact both Democratic and Republican lawmakers and lawyers from the relevant committees are doing the questioning.
In attacking all the diplomats, intelligence officers and civil servants who have stepped forward, at great professional risk, to bear witness against Trump, they are attacking the people who uphold the regulations — and provide the independent research and facts — that make our government legitimate and the envy of people all over the world, where many people have to bribe government workers for service.
And, finally, there are the internet barons who for too long ignored the weaponization of social media, which is turning our free press into a house of mirrors, where citizens can no longer cognitively discern fact from fiction and make informed judgments essential for democracy.
I watch it all and wonder: “Are you really doing that? Do you all go home at night to some offshore island where the long-term damage you’re doing to America doesn’t matter?”
And what’s even more frightening is that there are now so many incentives in place in media and politics — from gerrymandering to unlimited campaign contributions to data systems that can ever more perfectly define us, divide us and subdivide us — to ensure that these people will keep on hammering our system until they smash it to pieces.
Look at Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who was questioned last Wednesday at a House hearing by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. AOC was trying to grasp why Zuckerberg thinks it’s OK for politicians to run political ads that contain obvious lies, as the Trump campaign has already done in a Facebook ad about Biden viewed by some 5 million Facebook users.
This is all about money for Zuckerberg, but he disguises his motives in some half-baked theory about freedom of the press — so half-baked that he couldn’t explain it even when he knew he would be asked about it by a congressional committee. Read it and weep:
AOC: “Could I run ads targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal?”
MZ: “Can you repeat that?”
AOC: “Would I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying they voted for the Green New Deal? If you’re not fact-checking political advertisements, I’m trying to understand the bounds here of what’s fair game.”
MZ: “I don’t know the answer to that off the top of my head.”
AOC: “Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?”
MZ: “Congresswoman, I think lying is bad. I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That’s different from it being — in our position, the right thing to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.”
AOC: “So you won’t take down lies or you will take down lies? It’s a pretty simple yes or no.”
MZ: “Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves.”
Yeah, right, as if average citizens are able to discern the veracity of every political ad after years of being conditioned by responsible journalism to assume the claims aren’t just made up.
Just once I’d like to see Zuckerberg look into a camera and say: “I will take Facebook stock down to $1 if that is what it takes to ensure that we’re never again an engine for the perversion of democracy in any country, starting with my own. Facebook is not going to accept any more political ads until we have the resources to fact-check them all.”
I doubt he’ll do that, though, because his priorities are profits and power, and he seems quite ready to hurt American democracy to get them.
Would that he were alone. Think about the Oct. 23 statement that White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham put out, no doubt on Trump’s orders, after the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified before House committees.
Taylor’s testimony also indicated that Trump withheld vital military and economic aid from Ukraine to pressure its president to conduct an investigation that could sully the man he may run against in the next election — Biden.
“President Trump has done nothing wrong,” said Grisham’s Orwellian statement. “This is a coordinated smear campaign from far-left lawmakers and radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.”
And who is Stephanie Grisham to render that judgment? She is someone, The New York Times reported, who ascended to her job after a career in which she “mixed toughness and loyalty to her bosses with professional scrapes, ethical blunders and years spent alternately wooing and pounding the press on behalf of scandal-prone Arizona Republicans.”
And who is Bill Taylor? Someone who has devoted his entire adult life to public service — someone who has served honorably in both Democratic and Republican administrations, as a West Point grad, an infantry officer in Vietnam, a diplomat at NATO, a civil servant in numerous Cabinet agencies and a U.S. ambassador. Oh, and this “radical unelected bureaucrat” was chosen for his current position by Mike Pompeo, Trump’s secretary of state, who has not uttered a word in his defense.
And who is Sen. Lindsey Graham? He’s the senator who’s always willing to ask American soldiers to make the ultimate sacrifice in places like Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq — to protect our precious democracy — and he’s the senator who’s always unwilling to make even the smallest political sacrifice to protect democracy when it’s threatened at home by this president.
Graham was all for impeaching Bill Clinton for lying over sex with an intern, and he won’t lift a finger to judge Trump for using taxpayer money to coerce a foreign leader to intervene in our election on Trump’s behalf. Graham — and all the rest of them — will live in infamy.

Texto completo: On orders from President Donald Trump, the White House is ending its subscriptions to The New York Times and The Washington Post and is instructing federal agencies to discontinue their subscriptions.
No newspaper likes to lose subscribers. But I think The Times and The Post — both of which have won prizes for their penetrating coverage of the Trump administration — will survive.
“Not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving for taxpayers — hundreds of thousands of dollars,” said White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham.
Saving money did not seem to be Trump’s motive.
A few days earlier, he told Sean Hannity on Fox News: “The New York Times, which is a fake newspaper, we don’t even want it in the White House anymore. We’re going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post.”
Trump has long complained that the news media don’t give him the credit he deserves, calling them the “enemy of the people.”
He must be especially annoyed that The Times, The Post and other outlets fact-check his claims, often finding them to be false or misleading.
Even so, he was known to pore over The Times and The Post, focusing on news stories and opinion columns about — Guess who? — him.
Two news providers he likes are Fox News and the New York Post, both controlled by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Trump’s peevish action raises some questions:
Will White House aides and federal employees elsewhere be forbidden from bringing their own copies of The Times or The Post to the office?
Will they be forbidden to subscribe to the digital editions of the newspapers at work? The digital editions are cheaper than the printed newspapers.
Will other news providers that don’t cheer-lead for Trump also be banned?
Trump has often denounced CNN and MSNBC as “fake.” Will television receivers in the White House be tuned only to Fox?
When I was a newspaper editor, I took telephone calls from readers who threatened to cancel their subscriptions because they were mad at us for one reason or another.
After giving his name, one caller was especially abusive. He called the newspaper a blankety-blank “piece of garbage” and me a blankety-blank “Commie rat.”
I told him his language was so offensive I was going to cancel his subscription. He gasped, then yelled, “If you do, I’ll sue your blankety-blank off!” and hung up.
Of course, I knew I couldn’t cancel his subscription. I also knew he couldn’t live without our newspaper.
I wonder if Trump will feel the same about The New York Times and The Washington Post.

Texto completo: Even in exile, a former Soviet prisoner kept up his attacks on the Kremlin under both the Communists and Putin. But disputed child pornography charges marred his reputation.
Vladimir K. Bukovsky, a revered Soviet dissident who, after his release from the gulag, spent the second half of his life in Britain, denouncing President Vladimir V. Putin with the same fervor he had directed at the Kremlin's Communist leaders, died on Sunday in Cambridge, England. He was 76.
His death, at Addenbrookes Hospital, was caused by heart failure, said Elizabeth Childs, the president of the Bukovsky Center, an American-based volunteer organization. He underwent heart surgery in Germany in 2015.
Mr. Bukovsky had lived mostly in Cambridge since 1976, when the Soviet authorities freed him in exchange for the jailed leader of the Chilean Communist Party. He had spent 12 years in Soviet prisons and hospitals.
Lionized by Soviet-era dissidents, Mr. Bukovsky also inspired a new generation of Kremlin critics opposed to Mr. Putin, including the activist rock band Pussy Riot. For a time he was an informal adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain.
Even as tributes poured in Monday from Russia and abroad, Mr. Putin's spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, when asked about the death, said, "We don't have any comment about that."
For all his attacks on the Soviet and Russian authorities, Mr. Bukovsky also took a dim view of the European Union, which offended his commitment to increasingly libertarian views. He denounced the E.U. as a "monster" that had to be stopped and co-wrote a book, "EUSSR," which explored what he saw as the "Soviet roots of European integration."
Mr. Bukovsky was best known for exposing the misuse of Soviet medicine to "treat" political dissent as a psychiatric disorder -- something he knew about firsthand, having been sent to a psychiatric hospital. The practice began under Yuri V. Andropov, the K.G.B. chief who became head of the Communist Party for a little more than a year before his death at 69 in 1984.
Mr. Bukovsky's courtroom denunciation of the K.G.B.'s hijacking of Soviet medicine to serve political persecution enraged the authorities and established his reputation as a hero to fellow dissidents.
"Bukovsky's heroic speech to the court in defense of freedom and his five years of martyrdom in a despicable psychiatric jail will be remembered long after the torturers he defied have rotted away," the exiled Russian novelist Vladimir Nabokov wrote in 1974.
Galina Ackerman, a Russian émigré writer and translator in Paris who worked closely with Mr. Bukovsky in Resistance International, an anti-Communist organization set up in the 1980s, described him in a phone interview on Monday as "the great thinker of the whole Soviet dissident movement -- the most resolute and politically clearheaded."
Mr. Bukovsky, she said, "had a better vision than anyone of what was needed to weaken the Soviet regime."
Mr. Bukovsky was freed in 1976 in exchange for Chile's release of Luis Corvalán Lepe, the head of the Chilean Communist Party at the time, with the United States acting as intermediary. Mr. Bukovsky, who was 33, had been serving a seven‐year prison sentence on charges of anti‐Soviet agitation. The exchange took place in Switzerland, and Mr. Bukovsky then flew to London.
While many exiled dissidents, many of them intellectuals, focused on writing tracts, Mr. Bukovsky lobbied politicians in Britain and the United States to stand firm against Moscow. After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, he pressed for the release of Soviet soldiers taken prisoner so that they could publicize the Soviet army's brutal tactics.
His stubborn hostility to Soviet power led him to misjudge the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and he initially dismissed as a ruse Mr. Gorbachev's liberalizing policies that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
But it also made him deeply aware of the tenacity of anti-democratic forces in Russia, and long before Mr. Putin took power on New Year's Eve 1999, Mr. Bukovsky had warned that what seemed to be a new dawn of democracy in Russia would not last long. "His skepticism put him far ahead of everyone else," Ms. Ackerman said.
A believer in the importance of practical, even if doomed, political action, he tried to compete in Russia's 2008 presidential elections, holding rallies in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The electoral commission barred him from running against Mr. Putin's handpicked candidate, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who won easily.
In his autobiography, first published in Russian in 1977 and later reissued in English under the title "To Build a Castle: My Life as a Dissenter," Mr. Bukovsky compared his struggle to that of a Russian bear pursued by hunters. The bear, eager to grab a piece of carrion they had placed in a tree as part of a trap, keeps getting hit in the head by a block of wood while reaching for it. The bear eventually falls unconscious from the tree. That, Mr. Bukovsky wrote, "is an approximate description of my relations with the powers that be."
Gravely ill but still chain smoking, Mr. Bukovsky spent his last years in Cambridge trying to salvage his reputation after he was criminally charged in Britain over pornographic images of children found on his computer.
He pleaded not guilty, and insisted to The New York Times in 2016 that the images had been planted, probably as part of a dirty tricks operation by Russia. But a British computer expert who testified at his trial in December that year said there was no evidence of tampering, and that Mr. Bukovsky had apparently downloaded the images himself.
The trial, at the Cambridge Crown Court, was suspended soon after it started when Mr. Bukovsky was taken to a hospital with bronchial pneumonia. A full hearing of the evidence against him never took place. The trial was scheduled to resume in February 2018 but the judge, citing Mr. Bukovsky's "serious illnesses of the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys," ordered the case halted.
Whatever the truth of the prosecution's allegations, they did little to dent his standing as a giant of the dissident movement in the Soviet Union and later Russia, which he visited periodically until the Russian authorities, maintaining that they could not confirm his nationality, declined to renew his passport.
"Nobody I know really believed the accusations," Ms. Ackerman said. "He remained a hero."
Vladimir Konstantinovich Bukovsky was born on Dec. 30, 1942, in the southern Urals region now known as Bashkortistan, where his parents, both journalists and loyal Communists, had settled after being evacuated from Moscow during World War II. The family later moved back to the capital. There, in 1953, the death of Stalin stirred the young Mr. Bukovsky's first doubts about the Soviet system; he had been taught that Stalin was immortal.
As a student in the 1950s during the post-Stalinist period known as "the thaw" under Nikita S. Khrushchev, Mr. Bukovsky took part in public readings of previously banned poetry and started an irreverent literary magazine. After winning entry to Moscow University, Russia's most prestigious academic institution, to study biology, he caused outrage by describing the Soviet Union as a doomed "illegal society." He was promptly expelled. (He completed his biology studies decades later at Cambridge University.)
He was arrested for the first time in 1963 and detained for a time at Lefortovo, a notorious czarist-era jail in Moscow. Doctors at the infamous Serbsky Institut of Forensic Psychiatry soon pronounced that he was suffering from mental illness. Declared to be too ill to stand trial, he was sent to the Leningrad Special Mental Hospital for treatment. The move delighted him, he later wrote, because the hospital was "by all accounts a better place than a concentration camp."
A solitary man who never married and whose most trusted companion in Britain was his cat, Mr. Bukovsky acknowledged in his autobiography that his ordeal in the Soviet Union had warped his previously sociable nature and made him suspicious of other people. Too many whom he had trusted, he recalled, later testified against him.
After being imprisoned for a fourth time, he wrote, "I realized that there is no greater disappointment than the life one experiences after leaving prison." He explained what he meant: "When you meet someone for the first time, you inevitably view them as a future witness in your future trial."

There's a piece of Delaware in New Jersey

Texto completo: The Delaware River is the official border between the First State and New Jersey, right?
Yes and no.
Unbeknownst to many residents, the two states actually share two land borders, one of which is nearly 2 miles long.
Not only does Delaware own a small chunk of Artificial Island, where the Hope Creek Nuclear Power Plant is, but there's a weird swath of land just outside Pennsville, New Jersey, that belongs to the Diamond State.
The entire thing is only about 580 acres, but it and rights to the nearby Delaware River have been the subject of not one, but three U.S. Supreme Court cases, the most recent of which concluded in 2008.
Local residents call it "The Point" or "The Baja."
"It's weird, and it has been weird for a long time," Pennsville Mayor Robert McDade said of property's existence. "Most people wouldn't even know that it's out there."
So why is the tiny piece of land such a big deal? And why does it exist in the first place?
The answers to both questions are surprisingly complex.
How was the border established? The answer to the second question, which we'll tackle first, lies with Delaware's northern border, which is curved instead of a straight line.
Its existence dates from a deed to William Penn from the Duke of York on Aug. 24, 1682, which granted Penn all the land west of the Delaware River within a 12-mile compass circle beginning at the courthouse in New Castle.
Unlike other territorial boundaries, however, where rivers are essentially split in half between two states, the deed gave Penn rights to the entire waterway up to the low-tide mark on the east side.
Originally, that also gave Delaware ownership of a marshy wetland just outside Pennsville, which was designated a federally protected bird habitat in the 1930s.
It was called Killcohook National Wildlife Refuge.
But then, in the first part of the 20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began dredging the river and depositing silt at Killcohoook, eventually turning it into solid land.
Tim Boyle, a spokesman for the Corps, said the process took several decades.
Dredging helps keep the river deep enough for shipping traffic, and during and after World War II preserving nature took second priority to finding an easy place to dump silt and mud, according to The News Journal's archives.
The wetland was transformed into fields of tall plume grass and dusty hills, and Killcohook's status as a refuge was revoked in 1998. Conservationists cried foul and raised concerns about chemicals and pollution from the mounded dredge spoils.
Thousands of geese, mallards, ducks, teal and pheasants were replaced by empty beer bottles and junked cars. On a recent Thursday, the only sound one could hear at The Baja was that of the wind racing through invasive phragmites, a species of reed that crowds out native vegetation.
The New York Times, which wrote about the dredge-spoil dumping in 1985, said the failed wildlife area was perhaps one of New Jersey's "ugliest ecological secrets."
Ownership and management of Killcohook was "a real ball of wax," the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told the newspaper.
The land is part of Delaware, is owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has been managed as hunting grounds by wildlife agencies in both New Jersey and Delaware.
"It was a bastard within the national wildlife system," an official later told The News Journal in 1998. "It really has been kicked back and forth between its parents."
Today, Boyle said the land isn't used for anything specific. McDade, Pennsville's mayor, said dredge spoils are still routinely dumped there.
The Army Corps of Engineers has since become more environmentally conscious and uses dredge spoils to create or restore wildlife habitats, replenish beaches and more, according to its website.
What were the court cases about? New Jersey has long argued that the small strip of land created by dredging shouldn't be Delaware's in the first place.
There have been three Supreme Court cases between the two states over its ownership and rights to the Delaware River.
The first was resolved in 1905 with a compact between the two states that addressed fishing rights but didn't define the border. The second lawsuit, in 1934, concluded that Deleware owned "the river and the subaqueous soil" up to the low tide mark.
A third case in 2007 was sparked by a liquid natural gas plant. In 2005, a fight erupted between the two states over British Petroleum's then-proposal to build a $500 million LNG import facility just across the river from Claymont.
Under the plan, New Jersey would have built a delivery pier that jutted into Delaware's territorial waters. While New Jersey saw jobs and economic development, Delawareans feared potential explosions of the condensed fuel.
In 2006, Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington, co-sponsored a bill, likely in jest, that would have authorized then-Gov. Ruth Ann Miner to send the Delaware National Guard across the river to physically block construction of the port's bulkheads and piers.
New Jersey jokingly threatened to bring the Battleship New Jersey down.
By 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Delaware's laws could, in fact, prevent the plan from progressing.
No man's land While Delaware hasn't ceded the small strip of land outside Pennsville to New Jersey, it has relied on the other state to help maintain order there.
It's a bit of a no man's land, referred to by some local residents as "The Baja," Pennsville police Chief Allen J. Cummings said. He's not sure what inspired the nickname but said it's been referred to as that since he was a kid.
In the past, New Jersey police had no jurisdiction over the property, which means people would go there to commit crimes, according to a 1990 Baltimore Sun story.
Teens could do drugs and drink there without fear of arrest.
Then, in 1987, Pennsville police found the body of a 45-year-old hunter who had been shot in the head.
The department had to call Delaware coroner's office to pick up the body because no one in New Jersey was authorized to do it. The man was only 10 feet over the state line, authorities said.
The death, which was eventually ruled a suicide, highlighted jurisdictional issues over the land. Eventually, the two states agreed that the Pennsville Police Department could enforce laws on the property.
That doesn't mean Cummings and his officers patrol The Baja, the police chief said. They only go out there if they get a call about something.
"We've had a few fatalities up there, kids on four-wheelers or motorcycles or dirtbikes," Cummings said.
The mayor said for a time, after word got out that the land was a good place for off-roading, people were coming from nearby states like Pennsylvania with big trailers full of ATVs.
Accesses to the property are blocked off by iron gates, but they can be circumvented by small recreational vehicles, Cummings said. There are fewer off-road vehicles now, thanks to enforcement efforts, but teens likely still use the area to party.
Even so, it's better than it used to be when he was in high school. He said the department hadn't gotten any calls from the area in a couple of years, though if you walk along the shoreline there are signs of recent bonfires and drinking.
"We don't have to drive up there and check it every night," Cummings said. "It's not like that anymore."
The department also gets calls about human remains found in The Baja. Sometimes, when someone takes their own life by jumping off the Delaware Memorial Bridge, they will wash up on its shores.
Years ago when Cummings was a detective, a child even found a human skull on the beach, which he brought into the police department in a milk crate.
Near the site it was found, police found a pair of pants with a set of car keys in the pocket, which were matched to a vehicle found abandoned near the bridge.
When there are fatalities or human remains are found in the water or the land belonging to Delaware, Pennsville officers call the Delaware State Police Department, which recovers the bodies and heads up any subsequent investigations.
"It's an interesting place," Cummings said. "There's a lot of history there."

Texto completo: A Kentucky native leads the special forces group whose actions led to the death of terrorist leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a daring raid in Syria.
Lt. Gen. Scott A. Howell, of Cadiz, is the commander of the military's secretive Joint Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The command's Delta Force carried out the mission in Syria in which the Islamic State leader died.
Al-Baghdadi died after running from a house into a dead-end tunnel while being chased by U.S. commandos. He detonated a suicide vest that killed himself and three of his children, President Donald Trump announced.
"He died like a dog," Trump said of al-Baghdadi. "He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place."
"He was a sick and depraved man," he added, "and now he's gone."
Howell's exact role in the mission is unclear. But his involvement in the operation was mentioned on the Senate floor Monday afternoon by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and in a tweet by U.S. Rep. James Comer, who represents Cadiz.
Ken McGraw, a spokesman for U.S. Special Operations Command, declined to provide any information about Howell's involvement. "We cannot provide information about what roles specific individuals or units may or may not (have) played in that operation for classification, operations security and force protection reasons," he said.
Maj. Gen. John W. Brennan Jr., deputy commander of the Joint Special Operations Command, oversaw the mission, a source told The New York Times.
U.S. commandos launched the raid late Saturday, and no U.S. personnel were killed — but one dog suffered minor wounds in the operation.
Trump said the U.S. forces "accomplished their mission in grand style" in a "dangerous and daring nighttime raid." The operation lasted about two hours, he said. U.S. forces seized "highly sensitive information," including information about ISIS origins and plans.
McConnell said he and fellow Kentuckians are "especially proud" of Howell's role in "this daring mission."
"Lt. Gen. Howell is a career Air Force pilot who has spent his career deployed with and commanding special operations forces," the Kentucky Republican senator said. "Our nation's lucky to have this son of the Bluegrass serving where he is."
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin said the commonwealth is "very proud" of the "critical role (Howell) played in this weekend's historic operation in Syria that killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi."
"Because of the extraordinarily brave actions of his elite Joint Special Operations Command team, one of the world's most despicable terrorists is no longer a threat," Bevin said. "As Kentuckians and as Americans, we owe a deep debt of gratitude to Lt Gen. Howell and to all the valiant men and women in our military and intelligence communities who sacrifice so much to keep us safe."
Comer saluted Howell in a tweet on Sunday.
"Congratulations to #KY-1 native Lt Gen Scott Howell commander of Special Forces based at Fort Bragg upon the successful mission to kill ISIS Leader #AbuBakrAlBaghdadi - the top national security priority of the Trump Administration. #USA," Comer tweeted.
Cadiz Mayor Todd King said the city would do something to recognize Howell.
Howell has participated in operations in Iraq, Kuwait, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo, Mozambique and Djibouti. In his most recent tour, he led all NATO special operations forces in Afghanistan, according to his biography on the Air Force website.
He was commissioned through the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1987 and earned his wings at Fort Rucker in Alabama.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The U.S. government said Monday that it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
U.S. Ambassador Ronald Johnson, appearing in a video with Bukele, said that agreement "extends the (temporary protected status) for Salvadorans who are in the United States for one more year."
Later, Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, appeared to contradict the ambassador, saying via Twitter that the actual TPS program for Salvadorans wasn't being extended in legal terms: "That's not what happened."
The effect, however, appeared to be essentially the same: Salvadorans who have been living in the U.S. under the TPS program - safe from deportation and allowed to work legally - will continue to do so for at least a year after courts resolve a challenge to the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for El Salvador and several other countries.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that Salvadorans with TPS will have the validity of their work permits extended through Jan. 4, 2021.
"This is recognition of the achievements and good work of the government of Nayib Bukele," Johnson said.
The DHS statement said there was concern that "the sudden inflow of 250,000 individuals to El Salvador could spark another mass migration to the U.S. and reinvigorate the crisis at the southern border."
Man arrested in Texas shooting that left 2 dead, 12 hurt at party
GREENVILLE, Texas - A man suspected of opening fire at an off-campus college party in Texas, killing two people and injuring 12 others, was arrested Monday.
Brandon Ray Gonzales, 23, of Greenville, was taken into custody less than 48 hours after Saturday's shooting, Hunt County Sheriff Randy Meeks said. Gonzales, who was arrested at the auto dealership where he worked, was booked into the Hunt County jail on a charge of capital murder of multiple persons. Bond was set at $1 million.
The shooting happened around midnight Saturday outside Greenville, 15 miles southwest of a satellite campus of the Texas A&M University System. Authorities believe the shooter may have been targeting one person at the party of about 750 people, and that others may have been shot at random, Meeks has said.
Air Force's mystery space plane lands, ends 2-year mission
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. - The Air Force's mystery space plane is back on Earth after a record-breaking two-year mission.
The X-37B landed at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida early Sunday. The Air Force is mum about what the plane did in orbit after launching aboard a SpaceX rocket in 2017. The 780-day mission sets an endurance record for the reusable vehicle.
It looks like a space shuttle but is one-fourth the size at 29 feet.
Officials say this latest mission successfully completed its objectives.
This was the fifth spaceflight by a vehicle of this sort. No. 6 is planned next year from Cape Canaveral. According to Air Force Secretary Barbara Barrett, "Each successive mission advances our nation's space capabilities."
Pope declares Secret Archive of Vatican not so secret anymore
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has declared that the Vatican Secret Archive isn't so secret after all.
Francis on Monday officially changed the name of the Holy See archive to remove what he said were the "negative" connotations of having "secret" in its name.
From now on, the vast trove of documents, manuscripts and papyrus of popes past will be officially known as the "Vatican Apostolic Archive."
In a new law, Francis noted that the archive has long been open to scholars.
He said the name change better reflects the archive's reality and "its service to the church and the world of culture."
The archive contains the documentation on the life of the universal Catholic Church from the eighth century to the present.
Students join Iraq protests as clashes kill 3
BAGHDAD - Thousands of students joined Iraq's anti-government protests Monday, as clashes with security forces firing tear gas canisters killed at least three demonstrators and wounded more than 100.
The students skipped classes at several universities and secondary schools in Baghdad and across Iraq's majority-Shiite south on Monday to take part in the protests, despite the government ordering schools and universities to operate normally.
One of those killed was a 22-year-old female medical student, the first woman to be killed since the protests began this month.
In a separate development, three rockets struck a large military base north of Baghdad that houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, according to a senior Iraqi security official who said there were no casualties.
NC judges throw out congressional map for 2020
RALEIGH, N.C. - North Carolina judges on Monday blocked the state's congressional map from being used in the 2020 elections, ruling that voters had a strong likelihood of winning a lawsuit that argued Republicans unlawfully manipulated district lines for partisan gain.
The panel of three Superior Court judges issued a preliminary injunction preventing elections under the district lines, starting with the March 3 primary.
In the ruling Monday, the judges - Paul Ridgeway, Alma Hinton and Joseph Crosswhite - agreed that "there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of this action by showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the 2016 congressional districts are extreme partisan gerrymanders" in violation of the state constitution.
In Silicon Valley: Hundreds of Facebook employees have signed a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives saying they oppose the social network's policy of letting politicians lie in advertisements.
The New York Times reported Monday that more than 250 workers have signed the letter urging Facebook leaders to change the policy that they say is a "threat to what FB stands for." While that's a small fraction of Facebook's workforce of more than 35,000, it's a rare showing of employee dissent.
Facebook spokeswoman Bertie Thomson said the company appreciates its employees voicing concerns but it "remains committed to not censoring political speech."

Wegmans Feels Like Family, Even if It Isn't Mine

Texto completo: Now that the supermarket has moved to Brooklyn, I know why people have been awed by my last name.
"Are you a Wegman Wegman?"
I have been fielding variants of this question going on four decades, ever since I was a kid growing up outside Boston. No matter the context, I know what it means. Usually it's accompanied by an expectant glint in the eye, a visible frisson at the possibility the questioner is in the presence of supermarket royalty.
I am not, alas, a Wegman Wegman. Or, more precisely, the Wegmans of Rochester, N.Y. -- who founded the most beloved grocery chain in America, which opened its first New York City store, and its 101st store over all, in Brooklyn on Sunday -- have yet to claim me. As far as I know, I am just a garden-variety Wegman.
Still, I don't turn down the swag. Friends returning from trips to upstate New York used to bring my family cans of Wegmans green peas and boxes of Wegmans pasta, enough that we once dedicated a pantry shelf to unopened Wegmans items. In our downstairs bathroom hung a framed photograph someone sent us of a large sign touting the store's company values. ("At Wegmans we believe that good people working toward a common goal can accomplish anything they set out to do.")
And yet before Sunday, I'd barely set foot in an actual Wegmans store. The one time I did, about 20 years ago, I was passing through Buffalo, on my way to watch the Patriots play the Bills. I asked the customer-service desk for an official employee hat, but was politely declined, even after I showed my driver's license. I told my mother the story, and she decided to call Wegmans headquarters and order one for me. The call was going normally until she provided her name for shipping. The representative's tone changed instantly. "Yes, of course, Mrs. Wegman -- we'll send you a box of hats if you'd like! No charge, of course." My mother, it turned out, shared the name of the C.E.O.'s wife. I got my hat.
These days, the reminders mostly come in the form of misdirected tweets asking me, say, about today's rotisserie chicken seasonings in Pittsford. So when I heard that Wegmans would be planting its latest megastore about 15 minutes from my home, in Brooklyn's formerly decrepit but now gentrifying Navy Yard, I knew it was time, at last, for a real face-to-sprawling-produce-section.
The grand opening was at 7 a.m. Sunday -- the clearest indication of all that I am not related to these people. I dragged myself out of bed and hailed a cab in the predawn rain and wind. The neighborhood surrounding the Navy Yard is, to put it mildly, not Midtown Manhattan -- few other businesses and no subway lines to be found, although a positively suburban number of parking spaces are. Local residents, many of whom live in surrounding housing projects, have long had a dearth of quality grocery options.
By the time I arrived, the line was rock-concert long, hundreds of true believers wrapped around the block, a tangle of umbrellas unspooling down a remote stretch of Flushing Avenue. That was odd. The odder part was that everyone seemed to be happy. At 7 a.m. on a Sunday.
As the doors opened and we were swept inside, the aisles immediately filled with shoppers. It felt like the day before Thanksgiving. There were parents with small children, elderly people on motorized scooters, couples FaceTiming with faraway friends, showing off the perfectly aligned rows of bok choy behind them. Many had driven six hours from Rochester or Syracuse just for this moment. There were Wegmans hats, Wegmans tattoos, homemade T-shirts emblazoned with "Wegmans' Warrior" or "Wegmaniac."
In a soaring, 74,000-square-foot hall, it was impossible to stand anywhere without being in someone's way. That is a familiar New York feeling. What is not a familiar New York feeling is being smiled at by the people you bump into. Instead of being huffed at or passive-aggressively rammed with a shopping cart, I kept hearing, "after you," or "pardon me," or even "Good morning!" It was disconcerting -- like being in a Home Depot, but jam-packed with fresh food and friendly people.
I had heard about the emotional connection people have to Wegmans, but I had never seen it up close. I can report that it is a real thing. "Oh my God, grew up in Syracuse, a Wegmans addict," were the first words out of Lynn Schmidt's mouth, as though she was too excited to speak in complete sentences. Today Ms. Schmidt lives in New York City. "But every time we go back to Syracuse, it's all about Wegmans," she said. "No one compares. We've been waiting for decades in New York to have a Wegmans."
In the face of enthusiasm like this, the skeptical reporter in me is on high alert. But I will admit that the sheer size and positive energy inside the store was impressive, as were its alarmingly wide aisles. And it's one of the company's smaller operations.
So what explains this level of passion for a grocery store? Some of it is the natural loyalty that attaches to a family-owned business, which Wegmans has been for more than a century. Some of it is the fact that Wegmans predated the current trend of massive, well-stocked, high-quality supermarkets. But what struck me most in the end was not the range or quality of the food options -- after all, I can find the same at Whole Foods or other similar modern emporiums, albeit for more money. It was the sense of community, of shopping for food as reaffirmation of a shared civic life in which everyone looks out for one another. This sense seems to exist between the owners and the staff (Wegmans consistently ranks as one of the best workplaces in the country), and between the staff and customers. One woman told me that shopping at Wegmans reminded her of the way a line of cars pulls to the side of the road to let the ambulance go by.
In this communal aspect as well as in its size, Wegmans felt a bit like the Grand Central Terminal of grocery stores, a huge yet welcoming space that people have an almost daily need to visit, and where everyone is on equal footing, at least for that moment.
Except it's not central at all, which may be the best thing about it. And more than one-third of the store's 540 employees were recruited from the surrounding neighborhood, where good jobs can be very hard to find.
Denise Green grew up in Brooklyn and lives across the street from the Navy Yard. When I asked her why she was there, she said, "Because they just opened!" Like me, she'd never shopped in a Wegmans before. But her cart was already filled with food. "There's no good supermarkets in the area. There's one -- the food is rotten, it stinks, and they keep repackaging it and putting it out. So when you see something like this, you run for it."

Texto completo: SOUTH DARTMOUTH, Mass. -- The only piece of fiction in Jenny Slate's new book, "Little Weirds," describes a love that grew old in an un-air-conditioned house by the Atlantic Ocean.
"I was trying to say goodbye to my ex-husband, who is an important person in my life and a friend," the actress and comedian said of the story, "I Died: Bronze Tree." After her divorce from the director Dean Fleischer-Camp in 2016, she heard that sometimes, as a healing exercise, trauma survivors reimagine painful experiences. "I decided to write for myself what my life would be if I had a relationship that lasted till the end," she said.
Maybe this isn't what you were expecting from Slate, who is known for voicing animated characters in television shows like "Big Mouth" and "Bob's Burgers," as well as the internet's favorite anthropomorphic shell, Marcel. Nor is it what you might have assumed would emerge from the mind of the stand-up comedian whose monologues are punctuated by "poop and fart jokes," as she put it, among other bodily concerns. But "Little Weirds" wasn't really meant to be funny.
"People had approached me like, 'Would you like to write some humorous blah-blah-blahs?"' Slate said. "And my answer was no, I don't think I can."
She proposed an allegorical eco-feminist tome that she imagined would be in the vein of bell hooks. That didn't work out, either.
The book Slate did write, which Little, Brown will release on Nov. 5, is more autobiographical than sociological or critical, but it doesn't quite fall into the category of personal essays. The word "divorce" only appears a few times in its pages. Disclosures are often cushioned by whimsical rhetorical devices. Proper nouns, even the name of her dog, have been largely left out. She writes about nurture and nourishment: returning to the (almost certainly haunted) house where she grew up; drinking a beer alone in the airport; saying hello to the dog first, and the human second, if at all; admiring the ferocity of other women; watching the solar eclipse in a crowd of strangers; picking the perfect flower to fill her window boxes. You might call them personal abstractions.
"Little Weirds" has retained some of its original feminist underpinnings, in its reverence for nature and the female body, and its condemnation of male arrogance. Slate, who is 37 and was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton, said she couldn't have written like this in her 20s. "Even though I grew up in a privileged situation -- I went to private school, and my parents are both artists, and I had access to a lot of literature and art, and I had a really caring family and good health and safety -- I don't really feel like anybody directly spoke to me about feminism," she said. "I didn't understand that it was important to say directly that you are a feminist, and I didn't know what it meant."
It wasn't until she was cast in the 2014 film "Obvious Child," which revolves around a comedian's unplanned pregnancy, that she came to understand the relationship between her body, her voice and the rest of the world. She credits her feminist awakening to that film's director, Gillian Robespierre. They have become serial collaborators, ever since Robespierre identified something sensitive about Slate's stand-up.
"I think a lot of really dramatic actors cannot do comedy," Robespierre said, "but I do think there are more comedic actors and comedians who can perform difficult scenes and go to those deeper, darker places onscreen in a natural way."
Slate, a self-described "moderately successful actress," has leaned more comedic than dramatic in her career. But every now and then she gets a casting call that defies any notions she has about her range, like the time she was asked to read for the role of Pennywise in the film adaptation of Stephen King's "It."
"I had to put my computer across the room and look at it with binoculars and be like, 'Sorry, I'm so sorry,"' she said, recalling her incredulity at the email. Then she began to envision a world in which she got the part. "Do I have boobs as female It?" she wondered.
This week Slate released her first comedy special, "Stage Fright," on Netflix. The feature cuts from a stand-up set at New York's Gramercy Theater to documentary-style interviews with Slate's parents, Nancy and Ron, and her sisters, Abby and Stacey. (Her grandmothers make memorable appearances, too.)
In the Netflix special Slate also shares artifacts from her childhood: the Laura Ashley wallpaper, the debate trophies, the hex-like poems scribbled on the walls of her closet, cursing the classmates who wronged her. There's a wistful and resigned quality to it all -- she expresses doubt that she will amount to anything other than a "weird aunt" in a world full of disappointing men.
"Little Weirds," like many books published since 2016, makes dutiful references to Donald Trump and the reverberations of his election, though none so explicit as the ones Slate makes in conversation, about the proliferation of hate speech, violence and restrictive gender-based laws.
"When Gabe Liedman, my comedy partner, and I first started doing comedy, we felt really free to use language that were slurs against women or Jews or gay people, because we felt that that empowered us," Slate said. "And now it's like, I don't want to hear that at all. We are in an emergency, and you can't use that language because it's all flammable."
Since April, Slate has been living, mostly without air-conditioning, in the childhood home of her fiancé, Ben Shattuck. The couple also spends time on Cuttyhunk Island, located off Cape Cod, where Shattuck is the director of a writers' residency and where Slate in June gave a widely covered speech to the island's one graduating eighth-grader.
She spends her time reading, writing, swimming in the river behind their house on the South Coast of Massachusetts and napping, as Shattuck, who is also a painter and a curator, has taught her to enjoy. Sometimes they drive his mother's Prius an hour into Providence, R.I., the nearest city, for dinner and a movie. When they are together, Slate seems most herself; she talks about missing her parents, who live a close-but-far ferry ride away, on Martha's Vineyard, and reminisces about the time Rihanna complimented her on her dress.
She and Shattuck met two summers ago through a series of meaningful coincidences that brought them north of the Arctic Circle. Slate had flown to Norway to celebrate the 30th birthday of the author Rebecca Dinerstein Knight, whom she met in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill Park, in 2014.
"I had just seen 'Obvious Child,' and I was walking home through the park and I recognized Jenny. She was on the phone, and I gave her this incredibly ridiculous, silent round of applause as I walked by her," Dinerstein Knight said. "She blew me a kiss. And that was the whole exchange."
They connected that evening on Twitter and began an email correspondence. Dinerstein Knight sent Slate a copy of her first novel, "The Sunlit Night," to read.
Which brings us back to Norway. After the celebrations, they planned to visit Lofoten, the archipelago where "The Sunlit Night" is set, to scout locations for its film adaptation starring Slate. Dinerstein Knight and her husband, John Knight, invited his best friend to join them.
Shattuck appears anonymously midway through "Little Weirds." He and Slate talk about poetry. He roasts chicken, bakes an apple pie. She sees his butt. "Nobody touched me," she writes, "but it felt like I had been touched."

Texto completo: An old-school journalist and his stathead grandson
are generations apart
Zach Kram was roughly 13 years old when he thought of the perfect birthday gift for his grandfather. A young baseball fanatic, he created a statistic that was a knockoff of the then-popular VORP, or value over replacement player, which measures players against a hypothetical league average counterpart. Kram called his metric VORG, or value over replacement grandpa.
"I rated him, and he rated pretty well," Kram said.
The gag was particularly hilarious if you know anything about Kram's grandpa, Hall of Fame baseball writer Murray Chass.
Chass, 81, spent four decades writing about baseball for the New York Times, and he stands virtually alone in baseball media circles in his enmity toward the analytical revolution that has overtaken the sport over the past 25 years. In the aftermath of the 2003 publication of Michael Lewis's "Moneyball," Chass vociferously questioned how it was received in both baseball front offices and the media. And he continued his broadsides against analytics after he took a buyout from the Times in 2008 and decamped for the Internet.
"I would be better off playing a game of War with one of my grandchildren than reading about WAR," he once wrote on his website of the stat Wins Above Replacement, which has become a popular catchall metric in modern baseball.
Kram, 25, writes for the Ringer, often covering baseball in a style similar to the one derided by his grandfather. This summer, he wrote a story about the Astros, measuring their historical greatness with the help of a stat called Weighted Runs Created Plus.
"I tell him he shouldn't be using so many numbers," Chass said. "But he doesn't listen to me."
During his long career at the Times - he started in 1970 covering the Yankees before moving to the national baseball beat - Chass was a pioneering baseball writer, covering the labor side of the sport as no one before him had, including the players' fight for free agency. In the 1970s and '80s, he practically created the granular beat of reporting on contracts and how much players made, which ultimately helped push salaries higher.
In the later years of his career, Chass's fame took on a different dimension as he became an avatar for a group of older baseball reporters suspicious of or openly hostile to the way the sport was changing. Chass's feuds with the new breed of writers were many and glorious.
Chass took shots at stats luminaries such as Nate Silver (who once wrote an open letter to Chass at Baseball Prospectus) and at younger baseball writers such as Rob Neyer and Craig Calcaterra. "Bloggers . . . are jealous of the baseball writers who get to vote [for the Hall of Fame]," he once wrote. "They think they can do better, but they can't vote and it pains them."
Fire Joe Morgan, a website co-founded by TV writers Michael Schur and Alan Yang in the mid-2000s, made Chass a regular punching bag.
Kram grew up in suburban Washington as a devoted baseball fan. He pored over box scores in The Washington Post, and he often talked baseball with his grandfather, though he didn't read his columns religiously. He did, however, recall a period when he was not allowed to search for Chass's name on the Internet.
"My mother didn't want me to see people wishing death upon my grandfather," Kram said.
Kram didn't plan to be a sportswriter, but when he went to college at Washington University in St. Louis and got a laptop for the first time, he began reading websites such as FanGraphs and Baseball Prospectus.
"I guess I probably started out skeptical because of my family, but it wasn't like I felt guilty reading them," he said. "I wanted to learn."
In 2012, when Silver predicted all 50 states correctly in the presidential election, Kram became a bigger believer in the work Silver helped pioneer in sports. And as he read, Kram began to debate his grandfather on topics such as the usefulness of the win statistic for a pitcher and why earned run average was an incomplete measure.
"I remember going to his house for a Jewish holiday and he complained that the Warmongers - that's what he called people who liked WAR - had gotten to me," Kram said.
Kram became the editor of his college newspaper and afterward landed an internship at the Ringer when it launched in 2016, which led to a full-time job and mixed approval from his grandfather.
"Zach is very smart; he knows baseball," Chass said. He added: "The problem with baseball writers today is they don't do enough reporting. News is the most important thing, but so many writers are just making lists."
After Game 2 of the American League Championship Series, Kram wrote a list of the heroes from the game, ranked.
Whether grandfather and grandson have changed each other's minds at all depends on whom you ask. Kram still believes WAR is useful, as long as it isn't taken as gospel. He said he convinced Chass that Jacob deGrom was worthy of the National League Cy Young Award in 2018 despite only winning 10 games. "Maybe he did, but I can't say I remember that," Chass said.
Regardless of their perspectives, there are always reasons for them to talk baseball. "We bond over baseball history. He taught me to appreciate the labor history and its importance to coverage," Kram said. "I guess it's not history for him. He was there."

Media really worried that Trump might benefit from Baghdadi death

Texto completo: President Trump revealed Sunday that U.S. Special Operations forces finally eliminated Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the longtime leader of ISIS.

"He was a sick and depraved man,” the president said, without having to exaggerate. “And now he’s gone. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way, as a coward, running and crying. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place."

There are a lot of similarities between Baghdadi’s death and the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Both Baghdadi and bin Laden were world-renowned terrorists who ordered or inspired the murder of many, many, many Americans. Both were on the run from the United States and international forces. Both met their ends eventually, cornered like cowards. One area where the two events differ, however, is in American news coverage.

To wit, U.S. news media went wild for former President Obama, heaping praise on him for his "gutsy call" of giving the bin Laden raid the go-ahead.
For Trump, the news coverage has been the exact opposite of what we saw in 2011. It has been both weirdly reverent of the slain ISIS leader and critical of the White House.

“Watching the raid was like a movie, the president said,” the New York Times reported in a headline. “Except, there was no live audio.” It reported elsewhere, paraphrasing anonymous intelligence officials, “Mr. al-Baghdadi’s death in the raid on Saturday, they said, occurred largely in spite of, and not because of, Mr. Trump’s actions.”

Funny enough, there have been no similar attempts by the newspaper to downplay the Obama team's role in taking out bin Laden, even though then-Vice President Joe Biden opposed the raid.

On Face the Nation Sunday morning, CBS national security contributor and former CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell complained that the language Trump used to announce Baghdadi’s death was disrespectful.

“You don’t want a locker-room kind of feel to this,” said Morell. “That was the one thing we worked really hard on after the bin Laden raid, is don’t make those kinds of statements, because it does inspire other people.”

Later the next day, CNN hosted contributor and former CIA Director James Clapper, who made the exact same argument that Trump’s public remarks made him “cringe.” Because using the proper amount of respect for bin Laden did such a bang-up job dissuading the rise of ISIS, right?
Then there are the weirdly reverent news headlines and reports.

“Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, austere religious scholar at helm of Islamic State, dies at 48,” read a shockingly tone-deaf, and short-lived, Washington Post headline.

If you can believe it, that was not even the first version of the headline. It read originally, “Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Islamic State’s ‘terrorist-in-chief,’ dies at 48.”

The paper’s communications general manager, Kristine Coratti Kelly, said of the “austere” headline that it “should never have read that way, and we changed it quickly.” She said elsewhere that the heavily criticized headline was “written in haste.” I am not sure how that makes any sense, considering that it was the second iteration of an already-published headline.

Bloomberg News went with: “Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi transformed himself from a little-known teacher of Koranic recitation into the self-proclaimed ruler of an entity that covered swaths of Syria and Iraq.”
So it is the Koranic recitation — not the sex slaves, decapitations, destruction of artifacts, burning of enemies alive — that we are to remember him by? This is akin to reporting on bin Laden’s death and leaving 9/11 until the lower paragraphs.

Then there are the commentators working a bit too hard to convince themselves that it's not such a great thing for the White House, or even that there are downsides to Baghdadi's death.

CNBC’s John Harwood argued that the White House would not see a bump in the polls because "in the American psyche, Baghdadi was to bin Laden as an ant is to an elephant.”

It's worth noting that this sort of thinking got us ISIS — those in the know downplayed the threat of this “J.V.” terror group. Recall that Obama’s tan suit press briefing was the one where he admitted he had no plan to defeat ISIS.
“How killing Baghdadi affects the impeachment inquiry,” read a CNN headline this weekend that signaled a maybe a bit too much panic on the author’s part. The opening paragraph reads, “If you think something like the sensational killing by US Special Forces of the world's most wanted terrorist is going to quiet calls for President Donald Trump's impeachment, you are going to be sorely mistaken.”

We get it, guys. Trump cannot be allowed to have even one good day in office.

Thomas L. Friedman: Al-Baghdadi is dead, but the troubles of the Middle East are far from over

Texto completo: The killing of the founder and leader of the Islamic State by U.S. commandos operating in Syria should certainly further weaken the most vile and deadly Islamist movement to emerge in the Middle East in the modern era.
The world is certainly a better place with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead and a measure of justice meted out on behalf of all the women ISIS raped, all the journalists ISIS beheaded and the tens of thousands of Syrians and Iraqis it abused. Good for President Donald Trump for ordering it, for the intelligence agents who set it up, for the allies who aided in it and for the Special Forces who executed it.
But this story is far from over, and it could have many unexpected implications. Let’s start at home.
Trump was effusive in his praise for the U.S. intelligence agencies who found and tracked al-Baghdadi to the lair in Syria where he blew himself up to avoid being captured. In his news conference, Trump went on and on about just how good the men and women in our intelligence agencies are.
Well, Mr. President, those are the same intelligence agencies who told you that Russia intervened in our last election in an effort to tip the vote to you and against Hillary Clinton (and is still intervening). When our intel agencies exposed that reality, you impugned their integrity and quality.
And the same intelligence agencies who tracked down al-Baghdadi are the same ones who produced two whistleblowers high up in your White House — who complained that you abused the power of your office to get Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, touching off this impeachment inquiry.
And those same intelligence agencies whom you hailed as heroes for tracking down al-Baghdadi are the same “deep state,” the same agencies and whistleblowers whom your White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, just smeared as “radical unelected bureaucrats waging war on the Constitution.’’
So thank you for clearing up this confusion. We now know that the same intelligence services who have been heroic in protecting us from those who want to attack our constitutional democracy from abroad are the same heroes who have stepped up to protect our constitutional democracy from within. Unlike you, they took seriously their oath to do both.
As for the future of the Middle East, let’s not forget that ISIS was the Sunni Muslim jihadi organization that emerged after President Barack Obama’s administration eliminated the previous holder of the worst-person-in-the-world title, Osama bin Laden. Al-Baghdadi’s death — a very good thing in and of itself — is not the end of our troubles in and from the Middle East.
Trump’s effort to play down the significance of Obama’s killing of bin Laden — while playing up his killing of al-Baghdadi as the key to creating the peace to end all peace — only shows how ignorant he is about the region.
ISIS emerged in 2014 as the product of three loose factions or movements, as I pointed out in a column back in 2015.
One faction comprised the foreign volunteers. Some were hardened jihadis, but many were losers, misfits, adventure seekers and young men who had never held power, a job or a girl’s hand, and they joined ISIS to get all three. ISIS offered a paycheck, power and sexual release to men and women coming from closed societies or cultures where none of that was available.
ISIS’s second faction — its brains and military backbone — was composed of former Sunni Baathist army officers and local Iraqi Sunnis and tribes, who gave ISIS passive support. Iraqi Sunnis constitute about one-third of Iraq’s population. They had ruled Iraq for generations, and many Sunnis in the Iraqi military were enraged, humiliated and frustrated by how the U.S. invasion of Iraq had overturned that order and put the Iraqi Shiite majority in charge.
ISIS also derived a lot of passive support from just average Iraqi Sunnis after Iran and pro-Iranian Shiites in power in Baghdad, led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki — whom the Bush administration tragically installed — used their power to further abuse Iraqi Sunnis and keep them from jobs and out of the military.
For many Iraqi Sunni villagers under ISIS control, ISIS was just less bad than the brutality and discrimination they experienced under Iraq’s pro-Iranian Shiite-led government back then. Google “Iraqi Shiite militias and power drills” and you’ll see that ISIS didn’t invent torture in Iraq.
Fortunately, we and the Iraqis finally figured that out, and Iraq has a much better government today. But the U.S. keeps repeating the same mistake in the Middle East: overestimating the power of religious ideology and underappreciating the effect of bad governance.
As Sarah Chayes, who long worked in Afghanistan and has written an important book — “Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security” — puts it: “Nothing feeds extremism more than the in-your-face corruption and injustice” that some of America’s closest Middle East allies administer daily to their people.
The third ISIS faction was composed of the true religious ideologues, led by al-Baghdadi. They have their own apocalyptic version of Islam. But it would not have resonated so far and wide were it not for the first two factors listed above.
And that leads us back to Trump and his foreign policy. Trump has never met a dictator he did not like. He is blind to the fact that the next al-Baghdadi is being incubated today in some prison in Egypt, where President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt, whom Trump once actually called “my favorite dictator,’’ is not only rounding up violent jihadis but liberal nonviolent journalists, activists and politicians. Their only crime is that they want to have a say in their country’s future and help to create an environment where they can realize their full potential — so they will not have to look for dignity, power, a job or a girl’s hand from extremist groups like ISIS.
When Trump praises al-Baghdadi as his favorite victim and el-Sissi as his favorite dictator, all he is doing is walking in place. We’re actually getting nowhere.
And that brings me back to Syria. Syrian Sunnis supported ISIS for the same reason Iraqi Sunnis did. Iran, the pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia, the Shiite-Alawite Syrian regime of Bashar Assad and Russia have all collaborated to create a pro-Iranian Shiite minority government in Damascus, Syria. Of course they gave Trump a free pass to kill Baghdadi! His death just makes it that much easier for them to rule Syria without sharing power with the Sunnis. As long as that’s the case, there will be no stability there.
Finally, Trump kept going on and on in his news conference about how he, in his infinite wisdom, was keeping U.S. troops in Syria to protect the oil fields there so maybe U.S. oil companies could exploit them. He even boasted that while he was against the Iraq War, we should have taken over all of Iraq’s oil fields to pay for it.
This is disgusting talk, and again, a prescription for trouble in the future. If America has any role in the Middle East today, it is not to protect the oil wells but to protect and enhance what I call the “islands of decency.”
These are places like Iraqi and Syrian Kurdistan, Jordan, the UAE, Oman, Lebanon and the frail democracies in Tunisia and Baghdad. None of these are developed democracies; Oman, Jordan and the UAE are monarchies. But perfect is not on the menu in the Middle East right now. And these countries do promote more moderate versions of Islam and religious tolerance, they do empower their women, and they do encourage modern education.
These are the necessary but not sufficient antidotes to ISIS. They are worth preserving and enhancing in hopes that they can develop one day into something better for all their peoples. Just look at the democracy protests in Lebanon. You can see where the young people want to go.
Only Trump would boast of defeating ISIS and thinking that all that needs to be done now is to protect the Middle East’s oil wells and America’s favorite dictators — and not its wells of decency.

Texto completo: Un arresto en el verano fue crucial para conseguir la baja de Abu Bakr al Bagdadi, el líder de ISIS, este fin de semana.
De acuerdo con el New York Times, el plan para emboscar a Al Bagdadi comenzó en el verano cuando la CIA consiguió información sobre la ubicación del líder del supuesto califato gracias al arresto de una de sus esposas y un mensajero.

El interrogatorio a la mujer, que era de toda la confianza de Al Bagdadi, llevó a la CIA a unir fuerzas con iraquíes y kurdos para conseguir la ubicación específica. El Times asegura que los kurdos siguieron brindado información a Estados Unidos , sin importar que el presidente Donald Trump hubiera retirado a las tropas del norte de Siria para permitir una incursión turca.
Una fuente kurda dijo a EFE que habían estado coordinándose durante estos últimos meses con Washington, a quien agradeció su papel, pero el secretario de Defensa de Estados Unidos, Mark Esper , subrayó que la información acerca de la ubicación precisa de Al Bagdadi fue aportada por Turquía 48 horas antes de la misión.
Durante ella, los comandos estadounidenses atravesaron espacio aéreo ruso, por lo que Moscú fue avisado, y también le dio las gracias junto a Damasco .

Idlib es el último feudo insurrecto en Siria en el que se han concentrado una miríada de grupos extremistas y que habían dado una vía a Al Bagdadi para refugiarse, entre los que destaca la facción Hurras al Din (Guardianes de la Religión), la imagen de la red extremista Al Qaeda en Siria.
Es el Organismo de Liberación del Levante , una alianza islamista en la que está incluida la exfilial siria de Al Qaeda, la que controla prácticamente todo Idlib, considerada “terrorista” por Damasco y Moscú, que desarrollan desde el 30 de abril una ofensiva contra ellos.

Texto completo: Diane Foley, the mother of murdered war correspondent James Foley, said Sunday she was grateful to learn the US government was still searching for members of the group's leadership after news broke Sunday of the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group.
Baghdadi was the target of a US military raid in Syria, President Trump announced Sunday morning.
Foley, in a telephone interview shortly before Trump spoke, said the administration had given her a heads-up that an announcement was coming.
“I'm glad we are still on this issue," she said. “These folks are shrewd and will continue to pose a threat."
Foley's son James, a freelance war correspondent, was beheaded by members of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, in 2014, nearly two years after he was kidnapped in Syria. James Foley's execution was intended as retaliation for US military actions in Iraq around that time, the group said in a video posted online.
Foley, who lives in Rochester, N.H., commended the bravery of military members who carried out the operation against Baghdadi. But she said she would have preferred that Baghdadi had been taken alive so he could be tried in a US court.
“My preference is for all of these ISIS fighters and leaders to be held in custody and face trial," Foley said.
Later, on Sunday night, Foley said in an e-mail that Trump had called her in the late afternoon.
“I am grateful for that kindness and for finding Baghdadi," she said.
John Foley, Diane's husband, told WMUR-TV that the war on ISIS must continue.
“I believe ISIS is like grass," John Foley said. “You mow it, but it continues to grow. And I don't think that the elimination of al-Baghdadi is the final answer."
Trump told reporters Sunday that Baghdadi was targeted by US forces in Syria and died after fleeing into a tunnel with three of his children and detonating an explosive suicide vest.
“He was a sick and depraved man, and now he's gone," Trump said. “He died like a dog, he died like a coward."
Trump had teased a major development on Twitter Saturday, and multiple media outlets early Sunday reported Baghdadi's death.
Later Sunday morning, Trump told reporters during the press conference that the United States had brought the “world's number-one terrorist leader to justice."
The president referred to James Foley as one of four Americans killed by the terror group whose deaths “were especially heinous."
Earlier this month, Trump ordered the withdrawal of American troops from Syria's border with Turkey, which made room for the Turkish military to launch strikes in the region against Kurdish fighters who had been battling alongside US forces. The withdrawal also gave more than 100 Islamic State prisoners a chance to escape custody from Syrian prisons.
Officials were able to transfer two of Foley's son's alleged captors from a prison in Syria to one in Iraq following Turkey's incursion.
Foley said she has been waiting for the extradition of those men, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Amon Kotey, to face charges in US civilian courts. She said she believes that a fair court trial is the appropriate way to hold former Islamic State fighters accountable for their actions.
During her call with Trump Sunday, Foley said, she asked the president to bring both men to the United States for trial.
She said she also hopes that more will be done to bring home those still held hostage in Syria, and she worries about their safety given the turmoil that followed the American withdrawal.
Trump has since reconsidered a total withdrawal, and could leave about 200 troops in eastern Syria, The New York Times has reported.
Foley, who called on Trump to reverse his decision to leave Syria in an Oct. 10 opinion column she co-wrote for The Washington Post, praised the government for potentially changing course.
“I am glad that the government is reconsidering a total pullout," Foley said. “That leadership is needed [in the] hunt for the residual ISIS fighters."

Texto completo: EDINBURGH -- Tucked around a corner facing Edinburgh Castle is a modest memorial to accused witches, so unobtrusive that most tourists walk right past on their way to the larger attraction. Made in 1894, the Witches' Well is the only such remembrance in town. A plaque shows the profiles of two women, one angry, one mild, and a snake circling them both. Beneath is a small basin that holds not water but a few flowers.
Its size and tone belie what the University of Edinburgh recently demonstrated in a startling project published last month -- that Scotland was the locus of an extensive witch-hunting craze from 1550 to 1750. Its new interactive map shows for the first time the scale of the panic, when the authorities targeted more than 3,000 people throughout the country, from the largest cities to the most remote and sparsely populated islands.
The accused were teachers, nurses, domestic workers, tailors, farmers, ministers, coal miners, mostly female but also male, indicted by men and women alike. They were imprisoned, tortured with brutal creativity, and in many cases, executed. The intensity of the panic rose and fell more than once over these 200 years and, according to scholars, coincided with personal grievances and the state's insistence that all citizens actively promote God's will. And then it stopped.
The map, which first appeared in The Scotsman, allows users to geo-locate the accused witches, to see who they were and where they lived. It's a treatment that goes beyond typical data analysis to offer a visceral sense of horror at the number of people affected. Emma Carroll, a geology and physical geography undergraduate student, spent three months this year researching that information as the project's data and visualization intern. She drew on the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, a project that ended in 2003 but still holds a vast amount of data, and other historical resources to pinpoint where each person lived.
"I was quite surprised by the number of accused witches in Edinburgh and West Lothian -- there was an extremely high amount of cases in that area," Ms. Carroll said.
Popular attitudes have transmuted so much over time that one can now, at least in the West, casually self-identify as a witch. But the terror the two-century-long hunt inflicted on people was widespread and very real.
Agnes Hucheon, for example, was found "half-guilty" of witchcraft in 1595. Her punishment was public humiliation: She was stripped to the waist, placed in a cart and forced to confess while being driven around town on market day. Then she was locked in branks, an iron restraint for the face with a sharp gag. Janet Cornfoot was blamed more than a century later for causing a teenager's illness. In 1705 a mob of angry men beat her unconscious and left her for dead; the authorities then revived her so they could crush her to death under a door covered with stones.
Consider living with the knowledge that you could be next.
"People were afraid, and because of this overwhelming female majority, it was probably the women mainly who were afraid," said Julian Goodare, a history professor at the University of Edinburgh, the author of "The European Witch-Hunt," and a co-creator of the witchcraft survey. "In the most intense periods, it could be just about any woman. And they knew it could be just about any woman."
It's unclear how many were executed. The interactive map includes data on the deaths of 123 people. Other sources estimate 300 to 2,000. By any count, a staggering loss of life. Yet Scotland is not known as the capital of witch hunting. That distinction goes to Salem, Mass., whose witch hunt numbers pale by comparison: 15 months, more than 200 accused, 19 executed.
Instead the world knows Scotland as the land of kilts, whisky, haggis and beefcake Highlanders. Like its witchcraft panic, its positive contributions to humanity are also extreme and unsung, lost by the historical erasure that comes with living next door to a more powerful country, England, which has had the privilege of narrating history because it was the victor. How many people have heard of the Scottish Enlightenment, for example, the intellectual flowering in 18th- and 19th-century Scotland that spilled into the rest of the world? Or the Glasgow School, which influenced the Art Nouveau movement? Or the Forth Bridge, which transformed structural engineering?
But historical erasure poses a greater threat, beyond reducing a consequential nation to a caricature. When history is erased, there's no way we can study it, so the doom of repetition is guaranteed and the human condition stagnates. With the passage of the centuries we've come to understand that 100 percent of people accused of witchcraft were innocent. We recognize the nonsensical nature of a crime committed by being something, not doing something. But we still persecute people simply for who they are -- or who we think they are.
What will those living centuries from now think of us and who we choose to punish for the crime of their existence? Trans people. Muslims. Black people. Indigenous people. L.G.B.T.Q. people. Women of any color. Those with disabilities. Immigrants. Children of immigrants. The list goes on at sickening length.
Witch hunting is about the fear society has of others, about quarrels and misfortunes, and about the interests of state authorities. Executions began with officials' priorities and ended when those priorities changed. An unanswered question we might consider now is what happens to the community afterward.
"People didn't write things down about that," Mr. Goodare said. "'Are we really sure that person was a witch? Do we really feel better after we watched someone burn at the stake?' I've often asked myself that question and I've found it difficult to answer."
Five minutes away from the Witches' Well is a narrow close -- the Scots name for a type of ancient alleyway. This one, Advocate's Close, is named for Sir James Stewart, who lived there during the panic and as lord advocate investigated, prosecuted and oversaw dozens of witch trials. These days the close offers a nice view of the monument to the novelist Walter Scott, a shortcut to the train station, a trendy restaurant, some offices and a few flats. Near one timeworn door frame, in the stone wall beneath the buzzers of modern-day homes, is an oyster shell, slipped sideways into the mortar as a ward against witches, who were said to abhor water. Above the door is a stone carving dated 1590. "Spes altera vitæ" -- hope of another life -- a phrase full of longing.
For some it might evoke thoughts of deliverance by a supernatural power. But let's not wait for heavenly intervention. We can offer another life to people who need it the most, the ones persecuted over fantastical notions, imprisoned for who they are, executed for their existence. We can do it right here, on earth. We can do it now. And we should.

Heisler: Lakers have hopes, but Clippers are seeing dreams come true

Texto completo: We’re off and running in the capital of professional basketball.
It’s not just local fans who think that way with the Lakers back … they hope … and the Clippers at unprecedented heights of expectation.
All NBA metrics point this way. So many media outlets have moved correspondents here, the Wall Street Journal’s Jason Gay called Los Angeles “the Hemingway’s Paris of NBA dorks.”
Meanwhile, StubHub listed the leaue’s most in-demand teams, which started with:
1. Lakers.
2. Clippers.
As it turned out when No. 1 played No. 2, it was no contest. The opener was a Clippers home game – and one of the most eagerly awaited in franchise history – but so many Lakers fans bought up the place, TNT’s Reggie Miller guessed they made up two-thirds of the crowd.
When the Clippers brought Kawhi Leonard out before tipoff to welcome the crowd, there were audible jeers.
Leonard already knew the deal here. When he was shown on the Jumbotron at a recent Rams game, he was booed a lot more loudly there.
Not that hurt feelings proved a problem. Kawhi outscored the supposed prince of the city, LeBron James, 30-18, as the Clippers eased to a 112-102 victory.
James sniffed afterward, “It’s not a rivalry,” which is correct. The teams are playing for an NBA title, not local bragging rights, which are soon forgotten, even if it wasn’t the most gracious thing Bron could have said under the circumstances.
Of course, it’s a good thing for the Lakers it’s not a rivalry because they’d be losing it, having gone 5-24 against their crosstown, uh, neighbors since the start of the 2012-13 season – so long ago that Kobe Bryant and Dwight Howard were here.
Last week’s handful of games is, of course, only that, offering no proofs.
Nevertheless, however mixed the portents, they sum up the local teams’ relative positions.
The Lakers have reason to hope again with Anthony Davis’ arrival confirming their status as a destination for stars.
They retain their place as local darlings after decades of excellence, above not only the ugly duckling Clippers but the market’s old-time faves, the Dodgers and Rams.
The Clippers have most of the advantages that have been earned lately, starting with a managerial mismatch.
From an afterthought run by Coach Doc Rivers doing double duty, the Clippers have built the NBA’s hottest front office with GM Lawrence Frank and consultant Jerry West, with a deep staff of highly regarded young officials like Michael Winger and Trent Redden who turned down offers from other teams.
Meanwhile, the Lakers have to show they’re past last spring’s meltdown when Magic Johnson fled and Jeanie Buss and her friends and family took over.
Lakers fans still wince at the thought of West yearning to return in 2017, being left out in the cold and going, instead, to the Clippers.
Suggesting that unrest continued to bubble last summer, Jerry’s son, Ryan, another highly regarded young Lakers staffer, joined the Clippers.
Oh, and Ty Lue, the Lakers’ top coaching candidate before turning them down, is now an assistant on Doc Rivers’ staff.
The Clippers are deeper than the Lakers … and perhaps everyone else … with everyone solid in their roles from Patrick Beverley, Landry Shamet and Ivica Zubac to Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell.
Leonard slides seamlessly into his role as the starters’ missing No. 1 option, able to create shots out of nothing.
The injured Paul George, another two-way star, will add his own dimension upon his return with voluminous three-point shooting – he was No. 3 in makes last season, behind James Harden and Steph Curry – that will keep the floor spread wide open.
At the end of halves and fourth quarters, Kawhi and PG will meld with the crack second unit led by Sweet Lou and Trez.
Old dynamics are changing in the West. Five-time defending conference champion Golden State had dominated the Clippers, but that’s over as the Clips showed, routing the Warriors 141-122 in the opening of sparkling, stunned Chase Arena.
“This is not a one-off,” Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. “This is the reality.”
The Lakers, meanwhile, will need time with a new coaching staff and nine new players, experimenting with James at point guard while awaiting the return of key pieces Kyle Kuzma and Rajon Rondo.
This means showing the necessary poise, although they couldn’t have set the bar much lower.
It was a year ago at this time that they started 1-4 and Johnson called coach Luke Walton in for a loud reproach that the press reported, decibel by decibel, turning Luke into a lame duck.
We still don’t know the whole story, but LeBron’s agent, Rich Paul, was already criticizing Walton privately but widely, including to Commissioner Adam Silver, who acknowledged it (“I think he said something along the lines that ‘Luke Walton is not the right guy to coach LeBron.’”)
This almost certainly came from James and was conveyed to Johnson, which is presumably what tripped out Magic into airing out Luke, and there went their season.
In other words, Frank Vogel had better not take his time to get this working, or do stuff Bron doesn’t like.
Everywhere but here, the rise of the underdog Clippers is as big a story as the saga of the once-majestic Lakers – or bigger.
Eight New York Times writers, asked to make predictions, all picked the Clippers to come out of the West.
Four of the eight picked the Clippers to win the title, with three picking the 76ers.
Five picked Frank to be executive of the year.
Five picked Williams as sixth man of the year and one picked Harrell.
With all the local star power, the New York Times, Washington Post, USA Today, The Athletic, Fox and NBA.com have moved correspondents here. ESPN has an entire bureau on the beat.
“These days, almost every shoe meeting happens in L.A.,” The Ringer’s Bryan Curtis wrote. “Nearly every free-agent courtship is conducted in L.A., whether the team is based here or not. In June, the Timberwolves’ unsuccessful wooing of D’Angelo Russell included a helicopter flight over the city.”
For sure, this is where it’s happening.
Now, to see what “it” is.

Texto completo: For most of my life I’ve been glad that America is a society that relies heavily on tipping. First, tipping allows us to reward excellent service. Second, in a world of rising economic inequality, a 30% to 50% tip is a small but direct way to redistribute money to those who are working hard to earn a living.
Moreover, tipping nurtures humane relationships. It encourages servers to try to establish social connection through direct eye contact and a display of warmth. Finally, most of the servers I’ve known like the tipping system. They’ve believed that by doing their job well they could earn far more than they could through a flat wage. That’s certainly what I thought as a bartender.
So overall, I’ve taken it as good news that tipping culture seems to be spreading to every cashier’s counter in the land.
But if you look at the research you find that a lot of it doesn’t buttress my priors. In the first place, the amount of a tip is rarely related to the quality of the service. Michael Lynn of Cornell, who is the leading scholar on the subject, finds that the quality of the service has a relatively small effect on tip size.
What matters most is the size of the check. If you want bigger tips, induce your customers to order more. The second thing that matters is the customer. A survey of 40 million Uber trips found that men tip more often than women and people in the middle of the country tip better than people on the coasts. The identity of the customer matters more than the quality of the service.
In short, the meritocratic argument for tipping falls apart. Then there are all the downsides:
Tipping inflames a sexist dynamic. Some men use their tips as leverage to harass female servers. Young blond women are tipped more than older brunettes. Male Uber riders tip female drivers 12% more, but only if they are young.
Tipping inflames a racist dynamic. African American and Latino servers get much smaller tips. In a 2005 study of more than 1,000 tips to taxi drivers in New Haven, Connecticut, black drivers were tipped about a third less than white drivers.
Tipping widens class divisions. Servers who work in upscale restaurants can make good money. Servers who work in diners struggle. The people who work in the front of the restaurant might do well; those who work in the back do not. Many people think the very custom of tipping is a demeaning remnant from the age of aristocracy.
The conclusion from this is that in an ideal world, it would be a good idea to move to the French model: “service compris.”
But we live in actual America. In actual America, efforts to eliminate tipping have generally failed. Voters in Maine and Washington, D.C., passed ballot measures to phase out tipping. Both decisions were overturned after protest and confusion. Restaurants that move away from tipping often backtrack.
That’s in part because consumers have sticker shock when they see the 20% tip cost included in the menu prices. It’s also in part because customers like the tipping experience. If restaurants take it away, diners perceive that the service is worse, and the Yelp scores will go down. Such restaurants also have trouble retaining staff members.
So when you’re thinking about compensating servers, it’s best to start from the assumption that tipping will be around for a while. The smart thing to ask is, how can we make the best of a bad situation?
Which brings us to the real reason I’m writing this column. It is common these days to think that the way to do political and social change is: Think of the ideal system, then move to that. But the better way to make social change is: Think of the ideal system, then get as close as you can, given the restraints of human nature, and our own situation.
Thomas Sowell’s outstanding book “A Conflict of Visions” explores the virtues of working realistically within constraints, and the evils that ensue when people ignore or try to run roughshod over them. He would say the constrained vision is wiser whether the subject is tipping, expanding health insurance or choosing between capitalism and socialism.
In the unconstrained vision, you ask: What’s the solution? In a constrained vision you ask: What’s the best set of trade-offs and reforms we can actually achieve?
The constrained vision is wiser. So I’ll cheer on those who want to move America to a no-tip system. In the meantime, there are ways we can all make the best of a bad system:
* Tip 20% when the meal is over $25 and 30% when it is under.
* Always, always, always leave a tip in a hotel room.
* To combat implicit bias when tipping drivers and others, commit to a percentage for all rides and stick to it.
* Understand that the advantages you enjoy are products of both your individual effort and privileges you didn’t earn. Tip accordingly.

Maddow Confronts NBC News Over Weinstein Reporting

Texto completo: The MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow publicly confronted the leadership of her own network on Friday night, declaring live on air that she and other NBC News employees had deep concerns about whether the organization had stymied Ronan Farrow's reporting on the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.
In a prime-time monologue, Ms. Maddow questioned why NBC News executives had not invited an independent investigation of the Weinstein episode or the workplace behavior of Matt Lauer, the former "Today" show anchor who was fired in 2017 after a colleague accused him of sexual misconduct.
"I've been through a lot of ups and downs in this company since I've been here," Ms. Maddow said. "It would be impossible for me to overstate the amount of consternation inside the building around this issue."
Ms. Maddow also revealed that NBCUniversal, the network's parent company, had agreed to release NBC News employees from contractual clauses that could prevent them from speaking openly about sexual harassment they may have experienced at the network.
Ms. Maddow interviewed Mr. Farrow on her show -- itself a surprise booking considering her bosses have been at war with him since the publication of his new book, "Catch and Kill," in which he asserts that NBC executives blocked his reporting on Mr. Weinstein's brutal treatment of women.
Rich McHugh, Mr. Farrow's producer at NBC, said in an interview with The New York Times last year that their reporting efforts were blocked. He made that claim again in a detailed first-person article published by Vanity Fair two weeks ago.
NBC News has strenuously denied any suggestion that it got in the way of Mr. Farrow's investigation of the accusations against Mr. Weinstein, saying that his work was not fit for broadcast at the time he left the network in August 2017. Mr. Farrow later published his findings in articles for The New Yorker, the first of which was published in October 2017.
The magazine ended up sharing a Pulitzer Prize in the public service category with The New York Times thanks to Mr. Farrow's articles. NBC has maintained that his published work was substantially different from what he had when he was still at the network.
Mr. Farrow has been on a major publicity tour for his book, making appearances on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" on CBS, "The View" on ABC, and Fox News, among other venues. Until his Friday appearance on "The Rachel Maddow Show," he had not appeared on an NBC-owned property to promote "Catch and Kill."
Ms. Maddow -- whose program is MSNBC's No. 1 ratings draw -- represents the biggest name in the NBC family to express misgivings over the network's handling of Mr. Farrow's reporting. Her on-air statements on Friday were likely to increase pressure on the NBC News leadership team, including the chairman, Andrew Lack, and the news division president, Noah Oppenheim, who have faced scrutiny from the press and inside network headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
"The allegations about the behavior of Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer are gut-wrenching," Ms. Maddow said on Friday night. "But accusations that people in positions of authority in this building may have been complicit in some way in shielding those guys from accountability -- those accusations are very, very hard to stomach."
Additionally, Ms. Maddow expressed misgivings over what executives knew about Mr. Lauer's behavior before his firing in November 2017.
In May 2018, several months after NBC fired Mr. Lauer, NBC Universal released the findings of an investigation that absolved top news executives. "We found no evidence indicating that any NBC News or 'Today' show leadership, News H.R. or others in positions of authority in the News Division received any complaints about Lauer's workplace behavior prior to Nov. 27, 2017," the report said.
But the report also created a backlash, because it was overseen by NBC Universal's chief counsel, Kimberley D. Harris. Other media organizations that have faced accusations of workplace misconduct in recent years, including Fox News, CBS and NPR, hired outside law firms to conduct investigations.
Mr. Farrow, in "Catch and Kill," reported that NBC had issued secret settlements to other women who had complained about Mr. Lauer, a charge executives have vehemently denied.
"As far as we can tell, there has never been an independent investigation of that," Ms. Maddow said. "So until there is an independent investigation -- if there's ever going to be one -- that remains NBC's word versus Ronan Farrow's reporting and assertions."
In a statement that Ms. Maddow read on air, NBCUniversal, the network's parent company, said it would release former NBC News employees from any "perceived obligation" to stay silent about sexual harassment at the network. The statement referred to any nondisclosure or nondisparagement clause in employees' exit agreements, which, Mr. Farrow has argued, had unfairly prevented women from describing their experiences.
Mr. Farrow told Ms. Maddow that "NBCUniversal executives deserve praise" for the move, which he called "significant."
Ms. Maddow is the second MSNBC prime-time host to express support for Mr. Farrow. Last week, Chris Hayes praised Mr. Farrow's reporting on his MSNBC show, calling his work "the kind of journalism that you want to do as a journalist, that everyone who works in this business should want to facilitate."
"One thing is indisputable," Mr. Hayes said on air. "Ronan Farrow walked out of NBC News while working on the Weinstein story and, within two months, published an incredible article at The New Yorker that not only won a Pulitzer, but helped trigger a massive social and cultural reckoning that continues to this day."
Mr. Farrow also appeared on Ms. Maddow's show in October 2017, shortly after The New Yorker published his first article on Mr. Weinstein. That appearance helped spark a firestorm over why the story wound up in The New Yorker instead of on NBC's airwaves -- a question that persists two years later.
In the 2017 interview, after Ms. Maddow pressed Mr. Farrow on why he had not reported his story for NBC, Mr. Farrow said: "I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier, and immediately, obviously, The New Yorker recognized that. It is not accurate to say that it was not reportable. In fact, there were multiple determinations that it was reportable at NBC."
In "Catch and Kill," Mr. Farrow details the outraged reaction from Mr. Oppenheim and the MSNBC president, Phil Griffin, after the show ended.
"The moment she was off air, Maddow got her call," Mr. Farrow wrote. "She paced up and down the set, phone pressed to her ear, Griffin's raised voice audible even at a distance."
Mr. Farrow said Mr. Oppenheim shouted at him and asked him to sign a statement that "conceded the story had passed a legal and standards review but said it also failed to meet 'our standards."' Mr. Farrow wrote that he would not sign such a statement but promised that he would "avoid answering further questions like Maddow's."
On Friday night, Mr. Farrow, seated opposite Ms. Maddow at her studio desk, praised the anchor for her willingness to once again broach the issue in a public forum.
"People speaking truth to power about their own bosses, about their own institutions, is a really important part of how we can have an honest conversation about this," he said, as Ms. Maddow looked on.

Texto completo: Name: Mandla Morris Age: 14
Hometown: Calabasas, California
Now Lives: In the same two-story modern house in Calabasas where he grew up, with his mother, Kai Millard Morris, and older brother, Kailand.
Claim to Fame: Mandla is the son of Stevie Wonder and is starting to make a name for himself as a singer, TV personality and actor. In 2018, he had a cameo in "A Star Is Born," playing the son of the pastor.
Big Break: Mandla made his television debut last year as a contestant on "Dancing With the Stars: Juniors," where he finished in fifth place. Memorably, he danced the foxtrot with Brightyn Brems while his father sang "Isn't She Lovely." The competition came at an opportune time in his young career. "When my dad got the call from 'Dancing With the Stars: Juniors,' I was like, 'Of course I want to do this,' because I thought it would be super fun," he said.
Latest Project: Mandla will be featured in a new ad campaign for Ugg shoes alongside model Slick Woods. He is also in talks to develop a show with Brat TV, the YouTube production company behind the web series "Chicken Girls" and "Total Eclipse," which are popular with Gen-Z viewers.
Next Thing: Mandla is working on songs that he hopes to release as an EP next summer. "I want it to be about me finding myself as a new artist, and I definitely want this album to be something that my audience can relate to," he said. Meanwhile, he is a ninth grader at a private school in Southern California.
Designer Dreams: Mandla is not only following in the footsteps of his father but also his mother, who had a fashion line called Kai Milla. Inspired by Pyer Moss and Virgil Abloh, Mandla designs what he calls "high-end streetwear," including flared trousers with side zippers. "That's one of my favorites, and that's one Kim said he really liked," he said, referring to Kim Jones, the creative director for Dior Homme, whom he met in Paris with his mother.

Army trying to save cultural gems

Texto completo: It's no secret that the war-ravaged nations where U.S. soldiers have been enmeshed in conflict for nearly two decades are home to many of civilization's oldest and most prized antiquities and cultural treasures.
But in the heat of battle in Afghanistan or Iraq, how are troops to know whether they are taking their positions behind mounds of insignificant rubble or inside the precious remains of a 3,000-year-old temple complex?
The Pentagon's answer, announced Monday at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, is to take a page from one of World War II's most storied military units, the teams of art experts known as the Monuments Men who recovered millions of European treasures looted by the Nazis.
The Army is forming a new group with a similar mandate to be composed of commissioned officers of the Army Reserve who are museum directors or curators, archivists, conservators and archaeologists in addition to new recruits with those qualifications. They will be based at the Army Civil Affairs and Psychological Operations Command at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
"In conflict, the destruction of monuments and the looting of art are not only about the loss of material things, but also about the erasure of history, knowledge, and a people's identity," Richard Kurin, an anthropologist and Distinguished Scholar at the Smithsonian, said at the ceremony. "The cooperation between the Smithsonian and the U.S. Army aims to prevent this legal and moral crime of war."
Scott Dejesse, a Texas painter and lecturer at the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and an Army Reserve colonel who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the new group's mission is not to hunt down missing works of art in castles and salt mines, as the World War II force did. Instead it is to provide a scholarly liaison for military commanders and the local authorities to help secure the cultural heritage of the regions involved and rebuild civil society in war and disaster zones. Dejesse and Corine Wegener, director of the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative, developed the group together. Wegener, formerly a curator at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, is a retired Army reservist.
Ultimately, Dejesse said: "We want the host nation to protect their heritage. They're the heroes. They save their own day."
The new group will also aim to inform the U.S. military and allied forces of sites to avoid in airstrikes and ground fighting, and places where it should try to forestall looting. Those prevention and detection efforts conform to the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property, which the United States joined in 2009.
Officials said that the force would start training at the Smithsonian Institution over five days in March, and that they hoped to have about 25 experts ready to be deployed immediately afterward.
The training will encompass military doctrine as it relates to cultural protection, no-strike lists, and procedures to work with host nations to evacuate and safeguard museum collections.
The initiative comes at an urgent time for a region where human settlement dates back as far as 10,000 years and includes the remnants of Mesopotamian, Sumerian, Persian, Assyrian and Babylonian cultures. Afghanistan has been pillaged and desecrated by the Taliban for two decades; the Islamic State has wrought destruction and looted artifacts in Iraq, Syria and Libya; and rebel factions have sacked museums and mosques in Yemen.
While U.S. forces are hardly expected to defend cultural treasures everywhere there is conflict, the military field manuals indicate that preserving artifacts "is not only a legal obligation but also plays a vital role as a force multiplier, winning the hearts and minds of the local population." It also sends "a strong message that the U.S. military is respectful and professional," the manuals say.
The United States suffered a black eye during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when it was faulted for failing to protect the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad from plunder amid the chaos of the city's fall. Archaeologists and State Department officials had warned that the museum's tens of thousands of ancient objects were vulnerable, but the military had no equivalent of the monuments team at that point.
After that ransacking, Matthew Bogdanos, a colonel in the Marine Reserve and classics scholar, formed an ad hoc group that took charge of protecting the museum and hunting down its stolen items. He wrote a book on his experience, "Thieves of Baghdad" (2005). He serves as chief of the Antiquities Trafficking Unit of the Manhattan district attorney's office, the only such department in the nation.
Of the new group, he said, "It was a great idea when I first proposed it in back in 2003, and it is even more crucial in today's world where antiquities trafficking often funds terrorism."
Reserve leaders working on the project were eager to evoke their forerunners in wartime Europe. "It's like going back to our history," said Brig. Gen. Jeffrey C. Coggin, deputy commander of the civil affairs command, largely staffed by reservists, who is to run the group with its commander, Maj. Gen. Darrell J. Guthrie.
The announcement Monday, in the Smithsonian's Archives of American Art housing some records of the Monuments Men, is meant to recall the 345 people - mostly men but also several dozen women - who donned uniforms and applied their art expertise overseas from 1943-51. In the end, they tracked down and recovered 4 million of some 5 million paintings and other artworks, books, Judaica and valuables stolen by the Germans in wartime. Two lost their lives.
A George Clooney movie in 2014, "The Monuments Men," was based on work by Robert M. Edsel, a longtime champion of the Army art hunters.
As reservists, the team will not be deployed full time but will be attached to military units as conditions dictate, including in war zones where they could come under fire. The age limit for joining the Army Reserve is 35, but that limit is often waived for specialists, and organizers of this team say they are confident they will be permitted to recruit experienced professionals.
Britain has also formed a contingent of art reservists, the Cultural Property Protection Unit. Dejesse just returned from training with the British unit under Tim Purbrick, a lieutenant colonel and Gulf War veteran.
"The idea will be to identify sites so that we don't drop bombs on them or park tanks on top of them," Purbrick told journalists.
The new group's role will extend beyond war zones, said Kurin of the Smithsonian. In Haiti after the catastrophic 2010 earthquake, some 35,000 cultural treasures were rescued from the ruins, he said.
"Saving culture is not just the icing on the cake," he said. "It's the key to people's identity, who they are."

George Soros says Warren is 'the most qualified' 2020 candidate

Texto completo: Billionaire philanthropist George Soros argued Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the favorite to emerge from the Democratic primary but stopped short of endorsing her.
Soros, 89, who has a history of backing liberal causes and super PACs, praised Warren in an interview with The New York Times that was published Friday.
“She has emerged as the clear-cut person to beat,” Soros stated. “I don’t take a public stance, but I do believe that she is the most qualified to be president.”
The billionaire donor then qualified his remarks, making it clear that his comments were not an explicit endorsement of Warren.
“I’m not endorsing anybody because I want to work with whoever,” he added. “I don’t express my views generally because I have to live with whoever the electorate chooses.”
Soros, who supported President Trump's China policy last month, reiterated that stance later in the interview while discussing the tiff between China and the NBA, which began when a league general manager tweeted out his support for the protests in Hong Kong.
“I consider Xi Jinping’s China the worst threat to an open society,” he said of China’s president.
“We should recognize it: It’s a different system. It’s totally opposed to ours, diametrically opposed to ours,” Soros added. “I’m not anti-Chinese at all. I’m just anti-Xi Jinping.”

Texto completo: Gwen Ifill, a Simmons University alumna, groundbreaking journalist, and PBS “NewsHour" host who died in 2016, will be honored with a Forever Stamp, according to the Postal Service.
A photograph of Ifill will be featured on the 43rd stamp in the Black Heritage series. The stamp was designed by Postal Service art director Derry Noyes and features a 2008 photograph taken by Robert Severi.
“Among the first African- Americans to hold prominent positions in both broadcast and print journalism, Ifill was a trailblazer in the profession," the USPS said in a statement.
Ifill covered the White House, Congress, and national campaigns during three decades for The Washington Post, The New York Times, and NBC.
In 2013, she was named coanchor of PBS “NewsHour" with Judy Woodruff. They were the first all-female anchor team on network news.
Ifill got her communication degree from Simmons in 1977 and was the school's commencement speaker in 2009.

N.J. targets Trump club liquor license

Texto completo: The state of New Jersey is seeking to revoke the liquor license for one of President Trump's golf clubs — a rare and potentially damaging punishment, triggered by a 2015 case in which the Trump club allegedly overserved alcohol to a man who then caused a fatal wreck.
That proposed punishment was laid out in an Oct. 21 letter to the Trump golf course in Colts Neck, N.J. The Washington Post obtained the letter through a public-records request.
The office of New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, which sent the letter, declined to comment about the letter. Grewal was appointed in 2018 by Democratic Governor Phil Murphy.
The letter gives few details about the alleged misconduct by Trump's course. The man that the club is accused of overserving — Andrew Halder — caused a wreck that killed his own father and last year pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide.
Trump's company was given 30 days to challenge the planned revocation. If the state's Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control does decide to revoke the license, Trump can challenge that decision in court or try to get it reinstated in two years.
The Trump Organization did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
If the club's liquor license is revoked, that would be a blow for the Colts Neck course, located near the Jersey Shore. The club could lose significant revenue from the two restaurants and a bar it operates for members, and find it hard to attract banquets or golf tournaments from outsiders.
But for Trump, the potential damage is greater than that.
Under New Jersey law, anyone who has one liquor license revoked must also give up all their other liquor licenses for two years. Trump has two other New Jersey golf clubs, including the one in Bedminster that he uses as a summer White House.
Washington Post
GSA subpoenaed for Trump hotel records
WASHINGTON — The House Transportation committee issued a subpoena to the General Services Administration on Thursday, seeking financial records and other information regarding President Trump's District of Columbia hotel.
The hotel operates in the federally-owned Old Post Office Pavilion under a lease that Trump signed in 2013, when he was still with his company, and which has become the center of lawsuits and conflict-of-interest concerns since he took office.
According to a copy of the subpoena, sent by committee chairman Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat, to GSA administrator Emily Murphy, the committee is seeking any communications among the GSA and Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, or Eric Trump and the agency, as well as monthly financial records the Trump Organization provides to the agency.
Ivanka Trump managed the project for her father before he entered politics. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump are running the company while Trump is president.
The committee's request is the latest effort aimed at unearthing more information about the president's business, which he still owns while in office. The efforts include several court cases brought by Democratic plaintiffs and inquiries brought by investigators in New York state and Manhattan.
But Trump's administration and his business have aggressively resisted subpoenas in recent months, blocking Democrats on Capitol Hill and rebuffing investigators seeking information about his business dealings.
Trump has sued to prevent his accounting firm and bank from providing documents to House investigators and on Wednesday a personal attorney for Trump, William Consovoy, said in federal appeals court that a sitting president was immune from prosecution — even if he were to shoot someone.
Washington Post
Student vote is surging, but so are efforts to suppress it
AUSTIN, Texas — At Austin Community College, civics is an unwritten part of the curriculum — so much so that for years the school has tapped its own funds to set up temporary early-voting sites on nine of its 11 campuses.
No more, however. This spring, the Texas Legislature outlawed polling places that did not stay open for the entire 12-day early-voting period. When the state's elections take place in three weeks, those nine sites — which logged many of the nearly 14,000 ballots that full-time students cast last year — will be shuttered. So will six campus polling places at colleges in Fort Worth, two in Brownsville, on the Mexico border, and other polling places at schools statewide.
The story at Austin Community College is but one example of a political drama playing out nationwide: After decades of treating elections as an afterthought, college students have begun voting in force.
Their turnout in the 2018 midterms — 40.3 percent of 10 million students tracked by Tufts University's Institute for Democracy & Higher Education — was more than double the rate in the 2014 midterms, easily exceeding an already robust increase in national turnout. Energized by issues like climate change and the Trump presidency, students, who overwhelmingly lean Democratic have suddenly emerged as a potentially crucial voting bloc in the 2020 general election.
And almost as suddenly, Republican politicians around the country are throwing up roadblocks between students and voting booths.
Not coincidentally, the barriers are rising fastest in political battlegrounds and places like Texas where one-party control is eroding.
Some states have wrestled with voting eligibility for out-of-state students in the past. And the politicians enacting the roadblocks often say they are raising barriers to election fraud, not ballots.
“The threat to election integrity in Texas is real," the state's attorney general, Ken Paxton, said last year. But evidence of widespread fraud is nonexistent, and the restrictions fit a pattern of Republican politicians' efforts to discourage voters likely to oppose them.
The headline example is in New Hampshire.
There, a Republican-backed law took effect this fall requiring newly registered voters who drive to establish “domicile" in the state by securing New Hampshire driver's licenses and auto registrations, which can cost hundreds of dollars annually.
North Carolina Republicans enacted a voter ID law last year that recognized student identification cards as valid — but its requirements proved so cumbersome that major state universities were unable to comply. A later revision relaxed the rules, but much confusion remains, and fewer than half the state's 180-plus accredited schools have sought to certify their IDs for voting.
Wisconsin Republicans also have imposed tough restrictions on using student IDs for voting purposes. The state requires poll workers to check signatures only on student IDs, but some schools issuing modern IDs have removed signatures, which they consider a security risk.

Texto completo: A new biopic with Eddie Murphy hits Netflix. And "Maleficent" airs on TNT as its sequel plays in theaters.
What's Streaming
DOLEMITE IS MY NAME (2019) Stream on Netflix. Eddie Murphy wears vivid suits and tilted hats and carries a weighty cane in this new biopic. The film casts Murphy as the comedian Rudy Ray Moore, who at the crest of the blaxploitation era self-financed "Dolemite," a 1975 crime action movie in which he starred as a pimp out for revenge. The original movie became a cult hit. (A typical scene involves an F.B.I. agent being kicked into the trunk of a Cadillac.) The biopic charts the lead-up to and the making of that movie, with the help of an all-star cast: Tituss Burgess, Keegan-Michael Key, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Craig Robinson and Wesley Snipes play some of Moore's associates, and Snoop Dogg and Chris Rock each make cameos. The movie has a "loose, friendly, house-party vibe," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, and is intended as a comeback vehicle for Murphy. "I didn't want to just pop back up," he said in a recent interview with The Times. "I wanted a funny movie to remind them that they liked me. This movie turned out so strong that I figured this is a great way to come back."
ZOMBOAT! Stream on Hulu. Two post-apocalyptic comedy series hit streaming services this week. In this British sitcom available on Hulu, a cheeky group of travelers flee a zombie-infested Birmingham, England, by canal. And on Netflix, the comedy DAYBREAK revolves around cliquey teens in a post-apocalyptic Glendale, Calif., where a nuclear blast has transformed many grown-ups into zombie-like monsters.
IN CONCERT WITH CMS Stream on Allarts.org. This new series presents recorded performances from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, with a first episode that pairs performances of quartets by Mozart and Brahms. Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1 is performed by the pianist Wu Han, the cellist David Finckel, the violinist Daniel Hope and the violist Paul Neubauer.
What's on TV
MALEFICENT (2014) 10 p.m. on TNT. "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil" is now in theaters, but our critic wrote that this initial installment is better. A revisionist Disney blockbuster, "Maleficent" is a rethink of "Sleeping Beauty" that turns its attention away from Aurora, that fairy tale's protagonist, and toward Maleficent, its antagonist, who here gets a nuanced and sympathetic portrayal from Angelina Jolie. The movie was written by Linda Woolverton and directed by Robert Stromberg, who "does best when he scales down," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times, "as in the lovely shots of Maleficent walking next to a floating, unconscious Aurora, an image that telegraphs more about their relationship than any line of dialogue. The action scenes, by contrast, are visually uninteresting, borderline generic and unnecessary." But, Dargis added, "there's so much to look at in the movie -- from the wittily designed creatures to the shocks of bilious green and purple -- that the battles quickly fade."

If the club's liquor license is revoked, that would be a blow for the Colts Neck course, located near the Jersey Shore. The club could lose significant revenue from the two restaurants and a bar it operates for members, and find it hard to attract banquets or golf tournaments from outsiders.
But for Trump, the potential damage is greater than that.
Under New Jersey law, anyone who has one liquor license revoked must also give up all their other liquor licenses for two years. Trump has two other New Jersey golf clubs, including the one in Bedminster that he uses as a summer White House.

Trump says Colorado is getting border wall
Cheers filled a convention center in Pittsburgh as President Trump touted his long-promised border wall during a Wednesday event. But then, some in the crowd started to laugh. Others shook their heads and exchanged looks.
That's because Trump, in the middle of rattling off states the proposed barrier would run through, said, "We're building a wall in Colorado." He added: "We're building a beautiful wall. A big one that really works, that you can't get over, that you can't get under."
The brief, and incorrect, utterance instantly sparked widespread confusion and derision with many politicians and public figures pointing out that Colorado — located hundreds of miles north of Mexico — is not a border state.
"Well this is awkward . . ." Colorado Governor Jared Polis, a Democrat, tweeted. "Good thing Colorado now offers free full-day kindergarten so our kids can learn basic geography."
By late Wednesday, the gaffe was a top trending moment on Twitter and the reaction had grown so strong that even Trump appeared to notice. At 12:20 a.m. on Thursday, the president fired off a tweet in an attempt to clarify his comments, writing that he had "kiddingly" brought up Colorado to suggest that nonborder states could also benefit from the wall.
Some implied that Trump's gaffe could be the product of a knowledge gap.
"The geography department at Trump University was severely underfunded," a Twitter user wrote.
Washington Post
Times, Post subscriptions will be cancelled
WASHINGTON — President Trump has had it with The New York Times and The Washington Post. The White House is preparing to instruct federal agencies not to renew their subscriptions to the newspapers.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham is describing the move as a cost-saving measure.
Grisham says "not renewing subscriptions across all federal agencies will be a significant cost saving for taxpayers — hundreds of thousands of dollars."
Trump is often critical of the two newspapers and said in a Fox News interview on Monday that "we don't want" the Times in the White House anymore, and "we're going to probably terminate that and The Washington Post."
The White House plan was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.
It's unclear when the instructions will go to agencies.

Texto completo: Ta-Nehisi Coates and Ryan Coogler welcomed many to a night of Black excellence as they discussed Coates' debut novel, "The Water Dancer." Held at West Angeles Cathedral, The Library Foundation of Los Angeles' ALOUD series welcomed the two to celebrate "The Water Dancer," and more.
"The Water Dance" written by Ta-Nehisi Coates is his first fictional novel, and New York Times #1 Best Seller. His debut novel follows a young Hiram Walker, who write The Water Dancer.
Coogler asks, "At what point did you think you had something?" Coates explains his formula, stating the first draft was terrible. Also adding that of the 10 years, he didn't feel a true piece was created until just a year ago when he found the key element of the story.
"You can't talent your way to writing, it's built, it's a made thing. The real thing you have to do, you got to go back to that bad writing, you've got to revise. You have to get to bad to not-so-bad," he says and the crowd laughs.
With Coogler and Coates having a prior resells your kid, that s just as good as killing your kids. You're never going to see them again."
"I had seen the physical [violence] and how bad it was, I wanted to go here, I wanted an opportunity to write a different kind of narrative."
The two go through elements of the novel, reading an excerpt with a gut-wrenching monologue from a freed-slave who felt she was still in bondage because her family had not come to freedom with her. Coogler goes on saying he couldn't read the novel without thinking of mass incarceration, Coates agrees.

A Year of Mourning, A Year of Healing

Texto completo: Headnote PITTSBURGH
ON OCT. 27, 2018, unimaginable horror descended on the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as an anti-Semite extinguished the lives of 11 innocent Jews and forever changed the lives of countless others.
It was just before 10 a.m. that Shabbat morning when the killer, armed with an assault rifle, stormed the synagogue at the corner of Wilkins and Shady avenues where worshippers had just begun morning prayers at three separate congregations: Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life*Or L'Simcha. He had posted anti-Semitic rants on social media just prior to driving from his home to the neighborhood of Squirrel Hill and reportedly yelled, "All Jews must die," before murdering Joyce Fienberg, Richard Gottfried, Rose Mailinger, Jerry Rabinowitz, Cecil Rosenthal, David Rosenthal, Bernice Simon, Sylvan Simon, Daniel Stein, Mel Wax and Irving Younger.

As he fired his weapon, also seriously injuring congregants Andrea Wedner and Daniel Leger, the Pittsburgh Police received calls reporting an active shooter, and within one minute had dispatched officers to the scene.
Sirens rang through the streets of Squirrel Hill as worshippers at other local congregations began to receive the news that the Tree of Life building was under attack. The phones of Jewish Pittsburghers throughout the city buzzed urgently with texts and calls from friends and family all over the world, seeking to make sure their loved ones were safe.
By 11:08 a.m., the killer had surrendered to police, leaving four first responders - officers Timothy Matson, Daniel Mead, Anthony Burke and Michael Smidga - wounded.
It was the worst anti-Semitic attack ever to be committed on U.S. soil, according to the AntiDefamation League.
It was also "a very horrific crime scene," Pittsburgh's Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said at the time. "It's one of the worst I've ever seen."
Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill, the Tree of Life building. Like Sandy Hook and Parkland and Aurora, the names swiftly - and perhaps permanently - became inextricably linked to gun violence. For more than a week, the mass shooting there was the lead story for most major news outlets. Scores of reporters and photographers and videographers descended on Squirrel Hill, and locals quickly became accustomed to seeing their friends and neighbors interviewed by celebrity journalists on national television, or being quoted in The Washington Post or The New York Times.
Almost immediately following the shooting, the Pittsburgh Jewish community stood as one people. Children from Orthodox day schools prayed in front of the Tree of Life building, a sacred site that had housed Conservative and Reconstructionist congregations. Members from both the Orthodox and the non-Orthodox chevra kadishas worked side by side in tending to the remains of those killed, in accordance with Jewish law.
Local institutions sprang into action right away. Soon after the murderer began his rampage, the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh filled with thousands of people who waited in a makeshift "grief center" to hear the fate of their loved ones. The JCC, in cooperation with the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, provided space and comfort, fielded phone calls and offered aid to the FBI, Salvation Army and Red Cross. The Jewish Family and Community Services rapidly mobilized to provide counseling to the injured, bereaved families, community members and schools.
Neighbors did whatever they could, from donating blood to delivering food.
That Saturday night, students at Allderdice High School organized a candlelight vigil, attracting hundreds despite the rain. The following evening, thousands came to a vigil at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, where . both the "Star Spangled Banner" and "Hatikvah" were sung to an audience that included representatives of every Pittsburgh faith group as well as local political figures and Israeli dignitaries.
Jeff Finkelstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, stressed the importance of community. "We need the comfort of each other," he said. "We need love not hate, and we need that giant hug that this Pittsburgh Jewish community always gives."
Metaphorical and literal "giant hugs" also were offered by those beyond the local Jewish community for the Federation Victims of Terror Fund. Donations came from all over the world. The Muslim community raised funds for the victims as well, as did a 29-year-old Iranian immigrant, Shay Khatiri, who independently set up a crowdfunding site that amassed more than $1 million.
Visits by celebrities and political figures continued throughout the year, including, just days following the shooting, President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.
Among those who showed up in Pittsburgh to support survivors and victims of the massacres were those who knew firsthand the acute pain, anger and despair that follows a mass shooting - including Rev. Eric S.C. Manning, senior pastor at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Mother Emanuel was also targeted by a white supremacist, who in 2015 stormed the church during bible study and killed nine parishioners.
Manning's presence gave Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers strength at a time when it was desperately needed, said the spiritual leader of Tree of Life at the funeral for Rose Mailinger, 97, which Manning attended.
"An angel visited me this morning," Myers said at the funeral. "My tank, I don't think it's even running on fumes - the fumes have already dissipated. An angel came to me this morning to give me courage and strength."
Just one month prior to the Mother Emanuel visit, students, teachers and parents from Parkland, Florida, the site of the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, came to Pittsburgh to offer help with healing. Ivy Schamis, a teacher at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, returned to Pittsburgh to be part of a panel discussion on forgiveness at the JCC on Yom Kippur. At the JCC's annual meeting in September, its inaugural Loving Kindness Award was presented to Daniel Tabares of Parkland, a junior at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas in recognition of his inspiring work.

In August, families of victims and survivors of the Oct. 27 massacre joined with those from nine other cities that were terrorized by gun violence at a three-day Healing Through Love Meditation Retreat in Barre, Massachusetts, to learn coping techniques to manage the continuing suffering they experience, as well as to connect with others who are going through similar trauma.
"To meet with other families who had been through this made a huge difference," said Marnie Fienberg, daughter-in-law of Joyce Fienberg, at the time.
While relationships forged with survivors of past mass shootings helped with the healing, reports of new attacks throughout the year continued to re-open wounds.
On the last day of Passover, six months to the day of the massacre at the Tree of Life building, an anti-Semite stormed into the Chabad of Poway near San Diego, killing congregant Lori Gilbert-Kaye and injuring three others, including the shul's rabbi.
During an April 29 vigil for Poway at the JCC here, the Federation's Finkelstein thanked the crowd for coming out after "a raging anti-Semite shot up a holy place of worship on Shabbat and murdered our extended Jewish family."
"These are the exact words, the exact words, I spoke at Soldiers and Sailors Hall on October 28," he said, with irritation in his voice. "Unfortunately, they still resonate today. I'm sick and tired and frustrated and angry that I have to use them again."
Not surprisingly, Jewish Pittsburgh is different now than it was prior to Oct. 27, 2018. After the worst of humanity reared its head, the community then saw the best, which has delivered not only inspiration and comfort, but hope.
Tree of Life is on the road to rebuilding, having just announced plans for a renovation that will memorialize those killed during the massacre, and serving as a beacon of light in a world that continues to be thrust into darkness.
Jewish Pittsburgh has learned in the worst possible way that anti-Semitism is most definitely still alive in the 21st century, and that the violence it inspires can hit anywhere, even in the heart of Mr. Rogers' neighborhood.
But Pittsburgh's Jews also now know, without a doubt, that they are Stronger than Hate. *

To fact-check Trump, MSNBC turns to Ben Rhodes, who bragged about manipulating journalists

Texto completo: President Trump is known to lie, even when it does not matter. To fact-check him is easy.

But perhaps feeling that the world's irony content was too low, MSNBC, for some reason, this week called on Ben Rhodes, the former Obama White House staffer quite literally famous for lying to journalists, as the man to apply the fact-check.

Rhodes is also known for his astonishingly poor foreign policy judgment. In other words, MSNBC hosted the Democratic mirror-image of Trump to "fact-check" Trump.

The president claimed Wednesday that captured members of the Islamic State were "under very, very strict lock and key," and that only a "small number" had escaped following the abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces from northern Syria.

"They've been largely recaptured," said Trump.

Following the president's address, NBC News’ chief foreign affairs correspondent, Andrea Mitchell, inexplicably turned to Rhodes for a “fact-check.”

It is “obvious" that many ISIS prisoners have escaped, the former Deputy National Security Advisor told Mitchell, arguing further that one must look at the “broader context” of how terrorist groups come to power.

"Turkey has not had an interest in fighting ISIS," Rhodes said. "In fact, the situation that we faced in 2014 when this all began is that Turkey was actually permitting the free flow of people across that border into Syria to fight with ISIS. So it was the Kurds, who put their lives on the line, 11,000 Kurds lost in that fight against ISIS, with U.S. air support and the support of U.S. special forces."

Conspicuously absent from this conversation with Mitchell was any mention of the Obama-era “red line,” in which America’s 44th president pledged to take military action if Bashar Assad used chemical weapons on civilians, then failed to make good on that pledge when the Syrian strongman did exactly that. This contributed in a major way to dragging out Syria's brutal civil war and furthering the chaos in that region — chaos that Rhodes comments on freely without any mention of his and his former employer’s role in it.
BR
Also, we cannot have a discussion of Rhodes without mentioning the fact that he once bragged — he bragged! — to the New York Times magazine in 2016 that he manipulated reporters and pundits regularly to advance the Obama administration’s foreign policy agenda.
David Samuels’ profile of Rhodes’ reads:
In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. “We created an echo chamber,” he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.” When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America’s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. “In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,” he said. “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.” He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. “We drove them crazy,” he said of the deal’s opponents. Yet Rhodes bridled at the suggestion that there has been anything deceptive about the way that the agreement itself was sold. “Look, with Iran, in a weird way, these are state-to-state issues. They’re agreements between governments. Yes, I would prefer that it turns out that Rouhani and Zarif” — Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran’s foreign minister — “are real reformers who are going to be steering this country into the direction that I believe it can go in, because their public is educated and, in some respects, pro-American. But we are not betting on that.”
This is the man MSNBC turned to this week to “fact-check” the president on Syria.

So, do they turn to him again because they enjoy being lied to?

This is reminiscent of CNN extending contributor contracts to known liars from the intelligence community, including disgraced former FBI official Andrew McCabe and disgraced former NSA Director James Clapper. Why does cable news continue to elevate sources who cannot be trusted? There are surely knowledgeable experts who are not also liars whom you can put on camera to speak to the political issues of the day.

Aren't there?

Texto completo: "Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."
Mark Armstrong
A fresh chance to pick up a piece of Neil Armstrong memorabilia rolls up Friday when a Dallas auction house opens bidding on the fourth parcel of rare goods the space hero's sons have put up for sale.
The auctions, which have raised roughly $12 million so far, concerned some people close to the late astronaut – by nature a private person who stopped signing autographs when he learned people sold them.
In July, the astronaut's personal lawyer, Ross Wales, told the New York Times the auctions ran counter to that spirit: Armstrong "just didn't like to be made a fuss over."
But one of Armstrong's two sons, Mark, outlined in an email to The Enquirer the dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others, my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue since my father's passing," he wrote.
The Wapakoneta, Ohio, native was the first man on the moon. The auctions of his belongings have coincided with the yearlong celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing July 20, 1969.
Since October 2018, Heritage Auctions of Dallas has conducted three auctions of possessions that Rick and Mark Armstrong inherited from their parents, including hundreds of items from their father's astronaut career.
Rick Armstrong of Mason, the astronaut's elder son, declined to discuss the auctions.
In two emails, younger son Mark Armstrong of West Chester Township told The Enquirer he and wife Wendy plan to use a portion of their auction proceeds to build a charitable organization called Vantage Earth Foundation focused on the fate of the planet.
Aerospace historian James R. Hansen published his definitive biography, "First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong," in 2005, and the book became a 2018 movie.
"My concern as a historian is that I would want to know if there are any historically significant documents," Hansen said, such as a letter to Armstrong from Charles Lindbergh, the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927.
Armstrong gave 450 boxes of his papers to his alma mater, Purdue University. In October 2018, the collection's archivist wrote a letter to the Times that the Armstrong auctions were "problematic." The archivist didn't respond to emails for comment.
Mark Armstrong's email outlined dozens of donations and contributions he and his brother have made of their father's possessions. He said they also have ensured that auctioned items have been cataloged for public review.
The Lindbergh letter, for example, has been on loan since June 2017 to the San Diego Air and Space Museum, he said, and will not be in the auction.
In May, the brothers donated the Explorers Club flag "that our father flew on Apollo 11" to the Explorers Club in New York.
About a month ago, Mark Armstrong said, he and his brother made a donation of items to the University of Cincinnati, where their father taught for decades.
Among the goods is a 1971 letter from a key House leader thanking the astronaut for his service to the nation: "Surely NASA's loss is the University of Cincinnati's gain."
In 1978, President Jimmy Carter awarded the first Congressional Space Medal of Honor to Armstrong. That honor now is displayed at the "Destination Moon" exhibit of the Cincinnati Museum Center. Mark Armstrong said he and his brother have offered the medal permanently to the Smithsonian.
Mark Armstrong also listed 30 museums, nonprofits and other groups to which the brothers have loaned items or donated time, money or items.
"Although we are hard-pressed to understand how it is anyone's business what my brother and I decide to do with our personal property, I trust that you will find that these examples indicate that we have been thoughtful about where these historical artifacts should be housed for the long term," Mark Armstrong wrote.
"Furthermore, at our great expense, we made sure that all auctioned items have been researched, restored, preserved and photographed by both (Collectibles Authentication Guaranty, an independent evaluator) and Heritage Auctions, so that this information is accessible to anyone, worldwide."
The "Space Exploration Auction Featuring the Armstrong Family Collection" through Heritage Auctions has already brought in $12.14 million, said spokesman Steve Lansdale. Additional auctions have not been scheduled, but Lansdale said there are more items that could be put up for sale.
Bidding in the fourth auction opens online Friday. Among items available are other commemorative medals in gold and silver, 4-by-6-inch state flags that traveled on Apollo 11, a flight path to the moon that Armstrong drew and signed, an envelope postmarked the day Apollo 11 blasted off and Armstrong's 1951 order for a new Oldsmobile 88 from Niswonger Chevrolet in Wapakoneta.
Not all items on the block are from the Armstrong family. As in the three previous auctions, goods are available that were signed by Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, the other Apollo 11 astronauts. But all things Armstrong brought the highest prices.
Each of the Apollo 11 astronauts carried a specially struck gold medal. Armstrong's medal, which went to the lunar surface, sold in July for $2.04 million, the biggest individual sale of the auction. An American flag carried on Apollo 11 sold for $275,000.
Armstrong died Aug. 25, 2012, at Mercy Health Fairfield hospital after coronary bypass surgery. Documents show a nurse pulled wires leading to a heart pacemaker, which triggered bleeding around the heart that took more than an hour to stop. Armstrong never regained consciousness, and after his death, he was buried at sea.
In July, The Enquirer reported that Armstrong's sons threatened a wrongful-death lawsuit, and Mercy Health, Ohio's largest hospital system, settled the matter with a $6 million payment to the sons.
Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife, died in June 2018 at 84. Carol Armstrong, his second wife, lives in Indian Hill.
"Contrary to what you may have heard from others,
my brother and I have been very sensitive to this issue (of the late astronaut's possessions) since my father's passing."

Texto completo: The final season of "Will & Grace" begins on NBC. And a new food travel show with David Chang is on Netflix.
What's on TV
WILL & GRACE 9:30 p.m. on NBC. "Will & Grace" is ending -- again. The sitcom, built on the friendship between its title characters, who are a lawyer and an interior designer, pushed boundaries and helped normalize gay characters in prime time TV during its original run in the late 1990s and 2000s. It was revived for a season that debuted in 2017 and aged up the characters, but left the show's formula largely untouched: Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) were once again roommates. The 2006 original finale that saw the pair married (separately) with children was explained away as, in part, a dream that never happened. NBC has said that the latest season, the 11th, which debuts Thursday night, is going to be the show's last. But whatever happens in the new finale may not carry the same stakes as that first one: In theory, it could all be a dream, too.
SAUDI WOMEN'S DRIVING SCHOOL 9 p.m. on HBO. Since Saudi Arabia granted women the legal right to drive last year, tens of thousands of Saudi women have obtained driver's licenses. This documentary follows a handful of them through footage captured at a driving school in Riyadh, and through interviews where new drivers discuss the effect that the lifting of the ban has had on their lives -- though the film doesn't ignore the fact that constraints on Saudi women's lives remain.
What's Streaming
BREAKFAST, LUNCH & DINNER Stream on Netflix. The sun is out in Phnom Penh, and the "Saturday Night Live" comic Kate McKinnon is standing in an open-air market, holding up a giant freshwater prawn. "What do you think?" she asks, turning to the celebrity chef David Chang. "This one seems a little listless." That's a typical moment in this new series, which sees Chang, already a seasoned Netflix host known for his show "Ugly Delicious," exploring a different city, with a different celebrity each episode. The new series makes a point to delve into the history of each locale, and to show how that history has informed the cuisine. Other episodes take place in Los Angeles (where Chang is joined by Lena Waithe), Marrakesh (with Chrissy Teigen) and Vancouver, British Columbia (with Seth Rogen).
WOUNDS (2019) Stream on Hulu. In this horror movie, a smartphone comes with unwanted baggage -- and it's not an eavesdropping digital assistant. The film stars Armie Hammer and Dakota Johnson as Will and Carrie, a New Orleans couple. Will finds an abandoned phone on the floor of the bar he works at, pockets it, discovers disturbing content within and quickly finds his and Carrie's lives taken over. The phone, they discover, has a connection to the demonic. "'Wounds' was filmed on location, but we catch only glimpses of the city and scarcely feel the heat," Helen T. Verongos wrote in her review for The New York Times. "It could be anywhere." Still, she wrote, "the movie more than fulfills its promise to unsettle and to incite shivers -- and it doesn't quit."

Not Your Father's Masculinity

Texto completo: Meet the "new man": whatever others say he is.
John Wayne, that repository of testosterone -- now considered an illicit substance in many states -- once played a character who said, "You have to be a man first, before you're a gentleman." Who knows what, exactly, he meant by it? It sounded like a fine thing to say, back when men were unabashed "men." Now, we have #MeToo, and toxic males, and even such a once man-friendly rag as Gentlemen's Quarterly (i.e., GQ), which has historically celebrated men, seems to be just sick about them, eager to atone for their Y chromosome.
As a subscriber for decades -- and as a biological male -- I eagerly delved into GQ's "New Masculinity" issue. I've historically read the magazine that "meets millions of modern men where they live" for high-grade long-form journalism, or to settle existential quandaries such as, "What the hell is face serum and do I need to use it?" Still, one generally doesn't turn to men's magazine editors with soft hands who fret about conquering "your complex pant-shoe relationship" for instruction on the meaning of manhood. Not to pick on GQ, which, after all, helps us perform vital functions, such as how to "salute the celebrity mustache."
But after years of #MeToo scandals, which have revealed weirdos and perverts and sex criminals (and that's just R. Kelly), "toxic masculinity" is now regarded as tautology in some quarters. In more than a few tellings today, just to be a man is to be toxic.
So GQ's newish editor in chief, Will Welch, is taking a crack at overhauling our benighted gender, presenting an issue in which, as he puts it, "traditional notions of masculinity are being challenged" and "overturned." In doing so, he holds, we can be more generous, empathetic humans, even to ourselves, since "toxicity simply cannot thrive in the golden presence of genuine self-love." Tell that to Harvey Weinstein, who allegedly "self-loved" into a potted plant in front of one of his trapped victims.
For those curious to see just how much American masculinity is shifting -- at least at Condé Nast headquarters in Manhattan -- the trouble starts on the cover, in which the singer Pharrell Williams sports a canary-yellow, high-fashion Moncler sleeping-bag-as-gown, looking like Cinderella going to the Dick's Sporting Goods ball. From there, "The Glorious Now of Men in Makeup" spread is little surprise, with lacquered-up boy-banders, models and influencers dispensing invaluable beauty pointers, such as Gen Z trans model Casil McArthur, who advises going with "mascara and lip tint. If I want to be extra, I'll incorporate intense sparkles."
It's difficult to envision the guys down at the tackle shop or Tractor Supply going in for sleeping-bag couture and hot makeup tips. But then, they're the Old Man, the kind of man the new masculinity seeks to leave behind. Maybe they haven't paraded around female job applicants with open kimono, à la Charlie Rose, or haven't traumatized female colleagues by subjecting them to pelvic pinball, à la Mark Halperin. But in GQ's eyes they're guilty of a more universal sin: They're still living as men undefined by non-men.
The bulk of GQ's conversation starter is a package in which "18 powerful voices" have their say on the new masculinity. You'd think this would make for an interesting cross-section of representative men, but there, you'd largely be wrong, since traditional men seem afterthoughts in their own discussion. As the writer Rod Dreher has noted in his own analysis of the GQ spread, scratching out some back-of-the-envelope calculations, of these 18 purportedly definitive figures, "there are perhaps four who are heterosexual [cis] men -- about 20 percent." (Even though 95 percent of all males identify as hetero.)
Aside from the views of men like the filmmaker John Waters ("men are the ones who have penis envy"), or Magic Johnson's son, who has chosen a life "embracing traditionally feminine clothing and cosmetics," GQ seems primarily interested in soliciting women's opinions of what being a man means. Imagine Ms. or Jezebel doing the mirror version of this, with men mansplaining what women should be. Then run for your life.
You do get transgender men, like the boxer Thomas Page McBee, celebrating his "newly weaponized body," which might sound like a threat to women if he hadn't been originally gender-assigned to womanhood. There's the rapper Killer Mike, who, along with his wife, Shana Render, is interviewed in one of Atlanta's iconic strip clubs. But don't strip clubs demean women? No bother. Killer Mike is otherwise woke enough to pass muster (he is, after all, a Bernie Sanders supporter), and Ms. Render informs that they do dispense investment tips to strippers. "Catering, massage companies, real estate," Killer Mike adds.
Otherwise, there are a lot of women, all kinds of women. There's the comedian Hannah Gadsby, who suggests men scale back their confidence, refrain from sharing their opinions, while looking "to traditional feminine traits" and then "incorporating them into your masculinity." And there's Al Freeman, whose soft-sculpture work is an effort to examine hypermasculine spaces, "a mirror of the things that I wish would be softer, or more benign, or less threatening somehow." Think pillow versions of male genitalia or frat-house Jagermeister bottles. "I guess it's castrating humor, to some degree," Ms. Freeman says.
In an interview with Gayle King on "CBS This Morning," Mr. Welch reported that in GQ's survey of attitudes on masculinity, 97 percent said they felt masculinity was changing, and "30 percent of men said that they were confused by the changes."
Wonder how that could've happened.
As for me, I might be tempted to answer Vox's Liz Plank, one of GQ's 18 voices, who recently published a book, "For the Love of Men." While writing it, she went to Washington Square in Manhattan, thoughtfully asking men, "What's hard about being a man?"
"Having to listen to people who aren't men, or who are ashamed of manhood, constantly telling me how to be one," would be my short answer, after I stopped, dropped and rolled for cover.
But for actual guidance -- more sage than anything I read in GQ's masculinity symposium -- I'd turn to Edward Abbey, the ornery liberal who enjoyed baiting those on his own team. By most lights, he was a more reliable environmentalist than he was a feminist. ("The feminists have a legitimate grievance," he said. "But so does everyone else.") But Mr. Abbey, a former park ranger, did spend a lot of time observing nature up close, and not just the flora and fauna. Of man/woman relations, he wrote, "It is the difference between men and women, not the sameness, that creates the tension and the delight."
Why keep fuzzing distinctions that for millenniums have resisted fuzzing? Punish the sex criminals and pelvic pinball wizards. Good riddance to them all. But otherwise, let men and women be men and women, however that appropriately breaks, without laboring so hard to fuse them. Maybe our opposites attracting, which the furtherance of our species has depended on, isn't a design flaw, but its very essence. And maybe the wokerati ought to take their own most oft-repeated cliché to heart: Our diversity is our strength.

Texto completo: NEW YORK - As Lupita Nyong'o accepted an award from the Harlem School of Arts - and entered the stage to Beyonce's anthemic hit "Brown Skin Girl" - the actress mainly had two people to thank for fueling her passion for the arts as a child: her parents.
"I was thinking about (the Harlem School of Arts) and what it does for children and its students (and) I didn't have an institution where I'm from in Nairobi, Kenya. And so the only way my interest in the arts thrived was because I had parents who valued those interests," she said Monday night at the school's annual Mask Ball in New York City. "And my mother in particular, she really nurtured my artistic spirit."
The Oscar winner's mother, Dorothy, also received the Visionary Lineage Award alongside her daughter.
"I really didn't do much," Dorothy Nyong'o said to laughs from the audience. Dorothy Nyong'o said she noticed her daughter's interest in the arts as a child and so she looked "for opportunities to nurture that."
"My job was really to facilitate it, and I'd like to encourage parents to do it. Sometimes we make the mistake of trying to make our children what we think we want," she said.
Dorothy Nyong'o won over the audience with more sweet words for her daughter, who has appeared in films such as "Black Panther," "Star Wars," "Us" and "12 Years a Slave," for which she won an Oscar.
"I'm proud of her. She makes me shine."
Lupita Nyong'o, 36, thanked her mom for all of her support, explaining that when she was a teenager, her mother "drove to rehearsals after a long day at work" and sat "in the car for five or so hours and she never complained."

Married Minaj: Ms. Nicki Minaj wants you to know she's now officially Mrs. Petty. Minaj - who has dated Kenneth Petty for about a year - seems to confirm her marriage with a video on Instagram that shows off Mr. and Mrs. coffee mugs and bride and groom hats. She also changed her Twitter name to Mrs. Petty. The couple first dated as teenagers and reunited last year.
Book him: Former acting solicitor general of the U.S. and MSNBC commentator Neal Katyal has written "Impeach: The Case Against Donald Trump." The book, co-written with Sam Koppelman, comes out Nov. 26. Last month, Katyal wrote a New York Times op-ed piece in which he condemned Trump's "brazen conduct" and said impeachment was warranted even if he didn't commit an actual crime.
Snoop Dogg-endorsed: An Israeli start-up that promotes home-grown marijuana says it has signed on rapper Snoop Dogg as a brand ambassador. Snoop, an outspoken advocate of marijuana use, will promote Seedo's small refrigeratorlike machine that grows plants with the help of artificial intelligence. Snoop said that promoting a product that enables people to grow plants in unused urban spaces "is something I'm all the way down with." Snoop started his own line of marijuana products, Leafs by Snoop, in 2015.

‘Hillary Unplugged’: New York Times says Clinton is ‘living her best life’

Texto completo: Fresh off of her insinuation that Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is a "Russian asset," the New York Times insists that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is "living her best life."
"Freed of the constraints of public office, Mrs. Clinton seems to be living her best life," reporter Lisa Lerer wrote in a Monday op-ed. "Welcome to Hillary Unplugged."
Lerer highlighted Clinton's "giving zero, uh, cares" recently, including her jab at Gabbard, which was met with an avalanche of backlash but also some support. Clinton also tweeted out a fake presidential letter to troll President Trump and dropped out of an event that featured former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, moves the reporter argued signal the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee is finally "liberated."
"For most of her public career, Mrs. Clinton has been constrained by the expectations of her position, be it first lady, senator or secretary of state. Now, after her stunning loss in 2016, it seems she finally feels liberated to speak her mind," she wrote. "And she’s certainly stirring up a lot of drama while doing it. The two-time Democratic presidential candidate continues to loom large in the psyche of her party — both as heroine and villain."
Clinton's return to the spotlight comes as she and her daughter Chelsea promote their new book, The Book of Gutsy Women. But it also coincides with the 2020 presidential primary season, a race Democratic Party officials are privately wondering if she'll join. In addition to taking a shot at Gabbard, a veteran and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, she also taunted Trump with the idea of a "rematch" of the 2016 election.
"Why should she stay silent — particularly given the strangeness of our political times? After all, former Secretary of State John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, has also flirted with running for president again," Lerer pointed out. "And Senator Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, admits to being a 'lurker' in online political discourse, with a secret Twitter account under the name Pierre Delecto.
"Mrs. Clinton, at least, trolls under her own name," she added.

Texto completo: El alto funcionario anónimo del gobierno del presidente Donald Trump –que publicó un artículo en The New York Times— tiene una nueva sorpresa para el mandatario. Mejor dicho, le tiene Una advertencia, como se titula el libro que publicará en noviembre.
El misterioso personaje se volvió famoso tras publicar aquella editorial donde habla sobre el movimiento dentro de la Casa Blanca que busca asegurar el éxito del Gobierno estadounidense.
“Para ser claros, la nuestra no es la ‘resistencia’ popular de la izquierda” , dice aquella pieza publicada en septiembre de 2018 . “Queremos que la administración tenga éxito y creemos que muchas de sus políticas ya han hecho que Estados Unidos sea más seguro y más próspero” .
CNN obtuvo la portada del libro, el cual había sido un secreto, pero será lanzado el 19 de noviembre.
“Se han tomado fuertes precauciones para proteger la identidad del autor” , dijeron fuentes a la televisora.
Un borrador de un comunicado de prensa de la editorial Twelve describe el libro como como impactante.
“Retomando de donde se quedaron esas primeras palabras de advertencia, este libro explosivo ofrece una impactante historia de primera mano del presidente Trump” , indica.
Los editores afirman que el autor no publica el libro por dinero y que incluso analiza la intención de donar gran parte de las ganancia a la Asociación de Corresponsales de la Casa Blanca y otras organizaciones que luchan por la libertad de prensa.
También se desconoce si el autor continúa en la Administración Trump, además de que la Casa Blanca declinó hacer comentarios.

Texto completo: Readers call on Republicans to stop defending the president's actions. One appeals to Mitt Romney to run against Mr. Trump.
To the Editor:
Re "The Crisis of the Republican Party" (editorial, Oct. 19):
I believe that it is important to have a conservative alternative to the Democrats, but the Republican Party is too far gone to redeem itself. The latest scandal with hosting the G7 shows that when Republicans in Congress push back on the president's corruption, he backs down.
So imagine if from Day 1 the Republicans had protested President Trump's many lies, had demanded he separate himself and his children from their business interests, had upheld norms in environmental regulation, had held hearings as soon as it was obvious that Mr. Trump was permanently traumatizing immigrant children, and so forth.
The Republicans went along. Was it fear of losing an election? Were they simply laughing all the way to the bank? Did they enjoy watching the poor and vulnerable suffer? The reasons don't matter. The Republicans empowered an obviously corrupt president. They all need to be voted out of office, and thoughtful conservatives who were not corrupted need to build a new party.

To the Editor:
Let us summon a modicum of sympathy for Senate Republicans. Only they can resolve this mess. It's a stretch, but I can accept an honest argument that President Trump's behavior does not rise to the level of impeachment. O.K., but renomination?
Apart from a coldly dubious political calculus, there is no moral, honorable, prudent or even partisan reason to renominate this man. James Carville recently said the nation is depending on the Democratic Party to save us in 2020. No. It is up to the Republican Party.
Paging Mitt Romney: You are the best-placed person at this moment in history to end this with a full-throated challenge to Mr. Trump's nomination. It's a big ask. But you can mount a challenge with enough heft to provide honorable Republicans a way out short of impeachment and conviction, and save your party from a generation of ruin. In the bargain, you may save the nation.
Walter J. Stone

To the Editor:
Here's a question for each and every Republican senator. Did you run for office so your days could be drearily spent on the phone drumming up campaign donations, pontificating to empty Senate chambers and defending a president whose corrupt, inept, venal and infantile behavior is a clear and present danger to the Republic? Or did you perhaps -- at least at one time -- dream of being the sort of statesman and hero who would be spoken about with reverence?
History has presented each of you with that opportunity. Break with the president and watch as the house of cards that is the Republican Senate firewall collapses. One by one, others will follow you. If you doubt this, look at what happened when one courageous whistle-blower stepped forward to reveal President Trump's Ukrainian extortion scheme.
Republican senators have a rare chance to achieve an honored place in American history. I would grab that chance with both hands. Will any of you?
Nancy Stark
New York
To the Editor:
An open letter to Mitch McConnell and the rest of the Republicans in Congress:
Please think about this as you consider how to respond to President Trump's troubling behavior. History will look upon you favorably if you get things done the right way. It will look upon you forever as devils if good things don't happen. Don't be tough guys. Don't be fools!

David Leonardt: It’s time for a march of the Americans

Texto completo: On Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump’s election, Obamacare looked to be doomed. Millions of Americans, it seemed, were going to lose their health insurance.
Trump had campaigned on a promise to repeal the law, as had many other Republicans, and their party was about to control every branch of the federal government. All Republicans had to do was pass a law that Trump would sign. Democrats had no way to stop it.
Or at least they had no way to stop it using only the inside game of politics — congressional hearings, committee votes, presidential vetoes and so on.
Fortunately, some progressives understood that politics isn’t only an inside game. The outside game — of public protest and grassroots lobbying — matters, too.
Even before Trump took office, activists began planning a strategy to make repeal as politically painful as possible. On the day after Trump’s inauguration, some 4 million Americans took to the streets for Women’s Marches (which obviously were about much more than repeal). In the months that followed, groups like Indivisible organized people to attend town halls, visit Capitol Hill and inundate members of Congress with phone calls.
The efforts transformed the debate. Obamacare repeal was no longer a bloodless legislative matter, in which public opinion was measured merely with poll results and pundit analysis. The story became rawer, more human and much harder for politicians and ordinary citizens to ignore.
In the end, just enough Republican senators responded to the pressure, and Obamacare survived. The outside game had changed the math of the inside game.
The impeachment inquiry has reached the stage when it needs an outside game. We all know where the inside game is likely to lead: House Democrats will impeach Trump; Senate Republicans will acquit him; and he will claim vindication. But Trump’s presidency has become too dire for Americans to accept that outcome without trying to change it.
Consider what happened last week alone. Trump created a foreign-policy disaster in Turkey and Syria, for no apparent reason, while multiple administration officials testified that he views diplomacy largely as a way to advance his personal interests. His attitude, evidently, is: America, c’est moi. Even more so than a month ago, Trump is a national emergency, flagrantly violating his oath of office and daring the country to stop him.
Yet the chances of removing him appear as dim as Obamacare’s chances of survival did on Nov. 9, 2016. Trump even has plausible paths to reelection, some of which involve again losing the popular vote.
L.A. Kauffman, a historian of protest movements, has said that effective ones often throw “a monkey wrench into a process that was otherwise going to just unfold smoothly.” That’s the role that an outside game can now play in the impeachment saga.
It can wake up more Americans to the gravity of the situation. It can mobilize progressives to work as hard as they did during the 2018 midterms. It can confront congressional Republicans with their cowardice.
Do you remember the images showing throngs of people taking to the streets for the Women’s March? The size of the crowds, especially compared with Trump’s inauguration, reinforced the fact that most Americans rejected Trumpism. The marches also helped inspire the so-called resistance movement, which in turn created a network of dedicated activists, as the social scientists Lara Putnam and Theda Skocpol have pointed out.
And do you remember the viral moments from the save-Obamacare movement, like the disability-rights activists visiting Congress or the citizens speaking up at town halls? Jessi Bohon, a teacher in central Tennessee, created one of those moments by connecting the fight to her Christian faith. It was one of many ways that ordinary people held up for a vision of America as decent and communal as Trump is vulgar and selfish.
“Protests work,” as Kauffman has said — not always, of course, but often “when groups are willing to be bold in their tactics and persistent in their approach within the broad discipline of nonviolent action.” As Vox’s Matthew Yglesias wrote last week, public protest “serves as a powerful signal to the rest of society that something extraordinary is happening.” If anything, protest may be more important than in the past, because the elite institutions that helped bring down Richard Nixon, like political parties and the national media, are weaker today.
So it’s time for a sequel to that first Women’s March — an Americans’ March, in which millions of people peacefully take to the streets to say that Trump must go. And it’s time for a more intense grassroots campaign directed at his congressional enablers, one that conjures the respectful intensity of the save-Obamacare campaign. Even if the Senate still acquits Trump, a new protest movement can help galvanize people to defeat him, and his enablers, next year.
The country is in crisis. Right now, that crisis feels all too normal.

Texto completo: Dos senadores republicanos han expresado en los últimos días que se plantean apoyar el proceso que echaría al presidente Donald Trump de la Casa Blanca , en caso de que la Cámara de Representantes vote primero a favor. Esto hace que el llamado “muro rojo” de apoyo al mandatario se empiece a resquebrajar en el Congreso, a posar del sólido respaldo de las bases del partido.
Además, dentro del partido republicano también han surgido fuertes oposiciones a acciones polémicas del presidente como la retirada de las tropas estadounidenses del norte de Siria o intención (luego cancelada) de celebrar la Cumbre del G-7 en una de sus propiedades. Hasta ahora han sido dos los funcionarios republicanos que han alzado públicamente la voz contra el presidente.
Uno de ellos es el senador Lindsey Graham, de Carolina del Sur , que este lunes en una entrevista en Axios TV expresó una raro enojo por el comportamiento del presidente. Graham, uno de los más acérrimos aliados del presidente, aseguró que respaldaría el impeachment si se demuestra que el presidente se saltó la ley.
Por su parte, Mitt Rommey, senador por Utah , fue más allá en la entrevista con el medio ya que incluso enumeró los motivos para destituir al presidente de su cargo. Rommey sí que está entre los republicanos más críticos del presidente. De hecho, fuentes cercanas al senador dijeron a Axios TV que sería de los primeros en votar para condenar a Trump.
Trump sabe que el apoyo de un republicano moderado como Rommey a una hipotética destitución podría alentar a otros colegas de ideas afines a seguir sus pasos. El Washington Post y The New York Times coinciden en que esta teoría parece haber asustado al presidente, que el pasado fin de semana dio marcha atrás en su intención de celebrar la cumbre del G-7 en su resort de Florida .
Para que el impechament salga adelante en el Senado, tras su aprobación en la Cámara Baja. 20 republicanos deben unirse a los 45 demócratas del Senado y a dos independientes para conseguir al menos los 67 votos que echarían a Trump de la Casa Blanca. Hasta ahora, Axios solo ha identificado a ocho republicanos de la Cámara Alta que podrían votar en contra del mandatario.

Three ways to save big money on Halloween

Texto completo: 'Tis the season for fake spiders, light-up ghosts, tiny candy bars, and tacky costumes. All that Halloween stuff can make your bank account balance look downright scary! So, let's talk about three simple tips for saving money on Halloween.
1. Don't buy name-brand candy
There was a time in my life when I was overly concerned with being the "cool" house on the block. You know, the one with the really legit, exciting candy at Halloween — maybe even some full-size candy bars.
But when I saw the price tag at the store, that need to impress the neighbors left quick. I thought, Nope! Sorry, cute neighbor kids. You're getting the generic brand. I can buy a huge bag of it for half the price!
If you're on a tight budget, don't feel pressured to splurge and get the expensive candy. The kids will get plenty, and they'll all be on sugar highs anyway, so they'll never know the difference.
2. Scale back on Halloween parties
Halloween parties are pretty elaborate these days with huge spreads of food, amazing costumes, and even signature cocktails. If you're hosting or attending one, just be wise with what you spend. After all, Halloween is just one day!
If you're hosting, ask your guests to bring a dish to share. Set a budget for yourself on party supplies and decorations, and stick to it!
If you're attending someone else's party, don't feel pressured to bring the fanciest bottle of wine or go overboard with buying the most impressive costume. You don't want to go into November stressed out about overspending on this one day.
3. You can decide not to celebrate Halloween
Okay, I honestly don't love Halloween. Not for any spiritual or moral reason, it's simply because I'm not creative. And I'm terrible at coming up with costumes! Thankfully, my girls usually want to be princesses. That's something Amazon can fix. But I dread the day when they want something more imaginative. I'm not the mom who just whips up a costume out of odds and ends in my craft closet.
But guess what? No one says we must celebrate Halloween. There's no shame or guilt in a graceful no if Halloween doesn't fit your budget this year. If you sit this holiday out, you'll save so much money on candy, costumes, and ugly plastic partywear. Plus, you'll save time and energy. You can always jump back in next year, when you have room in your budget.

Texto completo: Shake Shack, a burger, hot dog, custard and shake chain with more than 250 locations globally, is coming to Madison.
The shop will open in 2020 at Hilldale Shopping Center where Cafe Porta Alba was, said Kate Hagen, who does publicity for Hilldale.
Porta Alba, the Neapolitan- style pizza restaurant, is set to close Saturday after 10 years at 558 N. Midvale Blvd.
The first Shake Shack in Wisconsin opened in late 2017 in Milwaukee's Third Ward. The Hilldale location will be the second.
Shake Shack was founded in 2004 in New York City by Danny Meyer, one of the biggest names in the restaurant industry. Meyer founded some of New York City's top restaurants, including Gramercy Tavern, The Modern, Maialino and Union Square Cafe.
There are now more than 170 Shake Shacks across 27 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and 16 countries, according to Shake Shack's Kristyn Clark. The company doesn't franchise, according to its website.
The story on its website is that Shake Shack grew out of a hot dog cart in Madison Square Park to support the Madison Square Park Conservancy's first art installation.
The cart was so popular, people lined up for three summers until it got a permanent kiosk in the park.
Shake Shack's website describes it as a "modern day 'roadside' burger stand" that serves up the "most delicious burgers, hot dogs, frozen custard, shakes, beer, wine and more."
Meyer is widely known as a speaker and educator. In 2006, he published "Setting the Table," which became a New York Times best-seller.
Taqueria moves to Park Street
When Juan Cazares closed Taqueria 3 Amigos on Williamson Street in late February because of spotty business, his plan was to open another restaurant in about two years after he saved up some money.
He said he was looking to reopen somewhere else on Williamson Street, or maybe in Middleton.
But an opportunity on Park Street presented itself and he jumped at it.
Cazares opened Arandas Mexican Restaurant Bar & Grill Oct. 5 at 1821 S. Park St., in a spot that was formerly home to the bar R Place on Park, and has been a couple of other businesses since.
Arandas is named after a small city in the Mexican state of Jalisco. Cazares grew up nearby, in the smaller town of Degollado.
Cazares was surprised to learn that there's a Mexican restaurant called Aranda's with an apostrophe in DeForest. He said he checked around before choosing the name.
The menu at Arandas on Park Street is basically the same as Taqueria 3 Amigos, but Cazares has added a few dishes, including Hawaiian fajitas with pineapple.
Cazares opened the original 3 Amigos in 2016 on Henry Street Downtown, where the Globe is now.
For Arandas, Cazares took on partner Jesus Ramirez, who worked with him at Laredo's on Fish Hatchery Road.
A big criteria for the new location was parking, and the Park Street restaurant has parking in back.
Arandas is next to the former La Movida radio station, which moved, but left its old signs.
Cazares said he and Ramirez are waiting for a liquor license.
They haven't done any advertising because they don't yet have enough staff. His old customers are finding him and following him on Facebook, Cazares said.

Texto completo: The singer headlines Tidal's benefit concert in Brooklyn; and the Museum of Modern Art debuts its larger, more diverse collection.
Pop Music: Alicia Keys Rocks the Vote With Tidal
Oct. 21; tidal.com .
Streaming companies give the music community plenty to gripe about -- namely, undercutting payouts to artists. Since launching in 2015, Tidal has positioned itself as a platform by and for musicians. Of course, performer-proprietors like Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Kanye West were the least vulnerable to the throes of the streaming economy. Even so, there's ample evidence of Tidal's ability to bring artists together for good.
Every year, the company stages a massive, all-star charity concert in Brooklyn, donating 100 percent of proceeds to causes, including natural disaster relief and criminal justice reform. This year's event, on Monday at the Barclays Center, will benefit Rock the Vote, a nonprofit dedicated to energizing young voters. The genre-spanning lineup includes stars of R&B (Alicia Keys), hip-hop (G-Eazy, French Montana, Doja Cat), reggaeton (Farruko) and folk-pop (Dermot Kennedy). OLIVIA HORN
Art: The New MoMA Mixes Things Up
The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan reopens this week, and the renovation and expansion of its physical space are the least of it. As The New York Times recently detailed, the museum has also fundamentally reconceived its permanent collection, breaking apart its monolithic modernist narrative to encompass a greater diversity of origins and mediums.
One huge addition is a gift of 90 works by Latin American artists from the Colección Patricia Phelps de Cisneros. Geometric abstractions by the Brazilian artist Lygia Clark will add a transcendent counterpoint to similar work by Europeans and Americans. WILL HEINRICH
Dance: Houston Ballet Turns 50
Oct. 24-26; nycitycenter.org .
It's not every day that a dance company turns 50. To mark the occasion, the Houston Ballet, led by its artistic director, Stanton Welch, presents its first program at New York City Center since 1986.
Along with Aszure Barton's "Come In" to music by Vladimir Martynov -- it was originally created for Mikhail Baryshnikov and his Hell's Kitchen Dance in 2006 -- Justin Peck presents "Reflections." Featuring a commissioned score for two pianos by Sufjan Stevens, one of Peck's closest collaborators, the work pays homage to ballet in an exploration of symmetry and balance.
But the highlight is Mark Morris's "The Letter V," a pastoral dance to Haydn's Symphony No. 88 in G Major, which showcases his sophisticated, understated approach to ballet. Would all of the artistic directors in the ballet world please take note? Live music is required, and here, the Orchestra of St. Luke's does the honors. GIA KOURLAS
Theater: 'Fires in the Mirror' Reignites Off Broadway
Oct. 22-Dec. 8; signaturetheatre.org .
On an August evening in 1991, a car crash in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, killed a 7-year-old black child as he was outside playing. A young Hasidic scholar who'd had nothing to do with it was stabbed to death in revenge. Days of unrest followed, with black and Jewish residents of the neighborhood, and the city, interpreting events through very different lenses of identity and experience.
Anna Deavere Smith constructed her Obie Award-winning 1992 work "Fires in the Mirror" from interviews with people on all sides -- each played, originally, by her. For the Signature Theater revival, those solo duties go to Michael Benjamin Washington, memorable for his comic turn as Tracy's grown son, Donald, on NBC's "30 Rock," and seen last year on Broadway in "The Boys in the Band." Directed by Saheem Ali, "Fires in the Mirror" starts previews on Tuesday, Oct. 22, at the Pershing Square Signature Center in Manhattan. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

TV: Don't Go Near the Water, in 'The Bay'
Oct. 22; britbox.com .
Every so often a missing-child mystery arises from the foggy shores of a hardscrabble seaside town and lays claim to being the new "Broadchurch." "The Bay," a six-part thriller debuting Oct. 22 on BritBox, is now that show.
It begins with a girls' night out in Morecambe, a coastal enclave in Lancashire, England, where, after a few rounds of booze and karaoke, one of the revelers takes to the alley with a bedroom-eyed Lothario. The next morning, stumbling with a throbbing head into a meeting about 15-year-old twins who have vanished the night before, she's revealed to be Detective Sergeant Lisa Armstrong (Morven Christie, "Grantchester"), a family liaison officer. And her fling soon turns out to be the very married stepfather of the teens who are missing.
But Lisa withholds that bit of information as she investigates the disappearance in a city with a suspect around every corner, and two vulnerable kids of her own. "The Bay," it turns out, is no "Broadchurch." But for a binge on a chilly autumn weekend, it's satisfying enough that you just might not be able to look away. KATHYRN SHATTUCK
Classical: A Musical Reflection on Haitian Matriarchy
Oct. 26; kaufmanmusiccenter.org .
After her grandmother passed away in 2015, the Haitian-American musician Nathalie Joachim began contemplating how to honor her legacy in music. "In what ways did our voices connect with the voices of other Haitian women?" she later wrote. "What did our songs tell us about our past, and what might they mean for the future?"
A multitalented composer, flutist, and vocalist, Joachim created "Fanm d'Ayiti," which translates to "Women of Haiti," as an evening-length artistic exploration of matriarchy, drawing Haitian folk and popular traditions into the world of contemporary classical music.
Delicately entrancing songs for string quartet, flute, and electronics -- led by Joachim's powerful and unpretentious voice -- alternate with recorded spoken interludes as well as the singing of a girls choir from Joachim's family's village. Released in August on New Amsterdam Records, the project arrives at Merkin Hall in Manhattan on Saturday, as part of the Ecstatic Music Festival, with Joachim joined by the intrepid Spekral Quartet.

Film: A Woman's Work on the Frontlines
Oct. 18.
As warplanes fly overhead in Syria, unleashing bombs and chemical weapons, Dr. Amani Ballor keeps smiling for the sake of the children. One of the few doctors who has stayed in eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus, she administers treatment out of a warren of tunnels and bunkers in an underground hospital called the Cave. Millions have already fled the region. But for the 400,000 residents who remain trapped, she and her team are their lifeline.
Directed by Feras Fayyad ("Last Men in Aleppo"), "The Cave" follows the 29-year-old Dr. Ballor on her harrowing daily rounds as she tends to the bloodied and broken with tenderness and humor. She also defiantly endures a harsh patriarchy that believes women should stay in the home and uses them as tools of war.
Trained as a pediatrician, Dr. Ballor decided early in her career to stand with the victims in a life that would be admittedly tough but perhaps more honest. "Is God really watching?" she asks while treating a baby whose breathing had stopped. "We will never give up, whatever they do!" KATHRYN SHATTUCK

One Cure for Malnutrition Of the Soul

Texto completo: Not long ago, I found myself inside a place that claims to be the oldest church in the English-speaking world -- St. Martin's in Canterbury, England, a few steps from the start of the ancient pilgrimage trail of the Via Francigena. It was my first stop on a pathway of more than a thousand miles, a trail from that modest clump of sixth-century stone and brick to the Vatican home of a pope struggling to hold together the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics.
Outside St. Martin's was a small welcoming sign: "We do not have all the answers. We are on a spiritual journey." Inside, there were no more than 20 people at a midmorning Sunday service.
At times, we have trouble seeing history as it slowly pivots. But we are at a moment that's been building for a century. Britain -- and much of Europe, the theological cradle of Christianity -- has perhaps never been so removed from belief in God. Elsewhere, the world is becoming more religious, and Christianity is growing, robustly so in China and Africa. With 2.2 billion followers, the faith that began as a small Jewish sect is by far the planet's most popular and diverse religion. But in Europe, where the rules of the spiritual here and hereafter were shaped over centuries of bloodshed, it's all a shrug.
A woman seized me immediately, sensing a fresh soul.
"Welcome, welcome, welcome!" she exclaimed. She took me forcefully by the arm and guided me to a tray of baked goods. "Would you like a cookie?"
One reason I wanted to follow the Via Francigena, which was first charted in the year 990, was to experience layers of time on consecrated ground. There's barely a village along the way that has not played host to some life-changing event. Would there come a day when all those shrines and reliquaries would be nothing but Michelin-starred curiosities -- left behind, like the great rock faces of Easter Island and Stonehenge?
But I had a deeper motive to get moving, mostly on foot, over that sanctified pathway. While organized religion may be dying in Europe, the pilgrim trails of the Via Francigena, and the better-known Camino de Santiago in Spain, are drawing crowds.
We are spiritual beings. But for many of us, malnutrition of the soul is a plague of modern life. That's one reason 200 million people worldwide a year make some form of religious pilgrimage.
In the vacuous tumult of the Trump era, I was looking for something durable: a stiff shot of no-nonsense spirituality. I'm a skeptic by profession, an Irish Catholic by baptism, culture and upbringing -- lapsed but listening, like half of all Americans of my family's faith.
But I was no longer comfortable in the squishy middle; it was too easy. I'd come to believe that an agnostic, as the Catholic comedian Stephen Colbert put it, "is just an atheist without any balls."
One sibling in my family was nearly destroyed by religion. The clergy in our diocese committed a monstrous crime, the scourge of sexual abuse known to many Catholic communities. Another sibling was made whole by religion, after losing a son to murder and finding that no one but God could salve her wounds. There are no clean lines in our clan.
On the trail, I repeatedly heard the term "deep walking." My fellow pilgrims were an odd assortment of spiritual stragglers of a certain age. But there were also many young people. And for the young, as I heard it described, a pilgrimage is a way to "do" religion.
At a Benedictine monastery in a tiny village in northern France, it was strangely moving to eat dinner in utter silence among a handful of men who've shed all material comforts to engage in rigorous daily aerobics of the soul. I missed Wi-Fi, Twitter, emails and endless digital updates, until I didn't.
At a stopover in Laon, a city of shimmering stone 300 feet above the plains of Picardy in France, I tried to fathom the power of miracles. About 80 percent of Americans believe in them. As a pilgrim, I had to dampen down my doubts, to try to see things in another dimension. "Miracles are not contrary to nature," as St. Augustine wrote, "but only contrary to what we know about nature."
I was less moved by one of the high shrines of atheism, in Langres, the hometown of the Enlightenment philosopher Denis Diderot. The town is just one step short of being Diderot Disneyland, which only the French could pull off. But after deep immersion in his beautiful, busy mind, I still felt a bit empty. Religion is story, a narrative about a force much greater than us, enigmatic by nature. Atheism has trouble telling a story.
In the Swiss Alps, a permanent prayer started to honor Maurice, said to be the first black saint, has been recited day after day, year after year, century after century by a rotating band of monks known as the Sleepless Ones. The martyred Maurice, who was from North Africa, is revered. His modern comeback has much to do with the vibrancy and growth of Christianity in Africa at a time when Christianity in Europe is dying off. If present trends hold, within 20 years Africa will have more Catholics than the Continent.
At Great St. Bernard Pass, the high point of the Via Francigena, at 8,114 feet, I was fascinated by a priest of 40 years who still struggled with his faith. "Doubts are allowed by God," said this man who introduced himself as Father John of Flavigny, a onetime medical student. "It's a bit like training for sports. If you only ride a bicycle with the wind at your back, that's not going to help you. You need to ride your bike against the wind."
The Italian part of the Via Francigena is the most glorious. And it was hard not to be exhilarated by the meld of landscape and spirituality in the Piedmont, Tuscany and Lazio; mysticism grows well in the southern sun.
When I left Canterbury in the spring, I wasn't sure what I would find on the Via Francigena. No pilgrim ever is. There were moments and days that I could not anticipate, and moments and days when there was clarity on some things.
At trail's end, following the footsteps of 10 centuries of wanderers, the cynic in me had given way to something else. The history of organized religion -- and Christianity's dark decades of intolerance, cruelty and compromise -- is not reassuring. But faith is not so easily dismissed. I took to heart one bit of advice for pilgrims from Pope Francis, the pontiff who claimed the name of a 12th-century pauper and mystic.
Do we "allow ourselves to be amazed?" he said. "Do we let ourselves be surprised?"
The Via Francigena is a trail of ideas. I'd started that trail reading Christopher Hitchens, the atheist and brilliant polemicist -- sustenance for my fortress of reason. "We no longer have any need of a God to explain what is no longer mysterious," he wrote. Yet each mystery explained, as the science-loving Pope Francis would say, builds the case for God. It's a case I came to understand, to feel it and see it, only after I'd allowed myself to be amazed.

Can This Be The Real Thing?

Texto completo: There are claims that the staid, crunchy workhorse usually found beside Buffalo wings can heal autoimmune diseases, among other benefits. Is that true?
Celery juice has been seemingly everywhere: The murky green potion looks like water from an algae-filled pond, yet its disciples have been downing it by the glassful. ￼￼￼ Yes, that staid crunchy workhorse usually smeared with peanut butter has gone to the top of the vegetable cart.

What is celery juice said to do?
Stories posted to Instagram and elsewhere are anecdotal, but say that the juice is the biggest medical remedy for digestive issues, autoimmune disorders, psoriasis, acne, chronic fatigue syndrome, acid reflux, the shingles virus, strep bacteria and weight loss. Many of the stories credit Anthony William, a self-professed originator of the celery juice craze.
Does it work?
"There's no scientific evidence to support any of the claims being made," said Rachel E. Scherr, an assistant research scientist in nutrition at the University of California, Davis. There aren't large studies in humans on the topic, and the little research that exists on the vegetable has been cellular or animal.
Nutritionists say other factors could be influencing juicers' sense of well-being: better hydration from celery's water content (celery juice is literally a tall drink of water, 94 percent so); or a placebo effect.
Should you still drink it if there is no evidence?
"Over all, it's a healthy juice," said Dr. Elizabeth Bradley, medical director of Cleveland Clinic's Center for Functional Medicine. Celery juice has more potassium and vitamin K than tomato juice and carrot juice. However, it is lower in important nutrients like vitamin A, which is abundant in carrot juice. Unlike other vegetables that may lose polyphenols and antioxidants from the pulp or skin when juiced, Dr. Bradley said, it is unclear how much loss occurs when juicing whole celery stalks. Nevertheless, nutritionists recommend consuming a variety of vegetables and their juices because they all have their own combination of phytochemicals, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.
The salty flavor in one cup of celery juice comes from the 215 milligrams of sodium, an essential electrolyte that helps our bodies maintain a balance of fluids. The recommended dietary allowance is less than 2,300 milligrams daily, but most Americans exceed that. It is a habit that can increase blood pressure, a risk factor for heart disease and stroke.
Juicing retains the taste and concentrates the nutrients, but many preparations reduce the fiber, which nutritionists say is the best part. The juice contains 3.78 grams per cup, still far below the 25 to 30 grams recommended daily, primarily from food. Fiber helps people feel full and maintain regularity.
Like kale and spinach, celery contains antioxidants and may have anti-inflammatory properties. Compared to the stalks, the leaves are more than 20 times higher in flavones, a class of flavonoids and compounds found in plants with antioxidant properties, according to a 2017 review in Advances in Nutrition. Food is complex, and just because a food is high in flavones doesn't translate into guaranteed health benefits. Compounds like flavones are modified after they are absorbed, and these modified forms might not have the same effect as what is demonstrated in preclinical studies, according to the review.
For those who were consuming few vegetables and are now drinking celery juice, nutritionists say that's a good change.

Why is celery juice suddenly everywhere?
Many credit Mr. William, who wrote a book called, "Celery Juice: The Most Powerful Medicine of Our Time Healing Millions Worldwide." He shares advice with his large fan base through his podcast, his website, his New York Times best-selling books, or in his contributions to Gwyneth Paltrow's site Goop.
Mr. William, who also uses the moniker "Medical Medium," is neither a medical doctor nor formally trained in nutrition, and his process is unconventional. "Spirit starts to speak to me and I write every word exactly the way spirit wants it until I have a stack of notepads many feet high," he said, adding, "It's a gift that was given to me."
His claims are as large as the fields of celery in California, the country's biggest producer. Nutritionists call his assertions unfounded. "Any reputable scientist would say there's nothing here," said David Levitsky, a professor of nutrition and psychology at Cornell University. "And I guarantee you next year there will be some other juice or food or magical mushroom that will come out and offer these same properties."
However, across the country, according to an analysis from the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, cartons of celery were fetching $ 15.05 earlier this month, a 42.8 percent increase from the same time the year before, although far below the high of $ 73.66 in April.
How was celery used before?
Celery is from the plant Apium graveolens, and is a relative of carrots, parsley and cilantro. Before being cast to the bottom of the crisper, it had quite the illustrious history. Charles Davis, a plant evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, said that the Egyptians placed wild celery in King Tutankhamen's tomb in 1325 B.C. and that the first cultivated medicinal use of celery dates to 400 B.C. by the Romans.
Greeks drank a wine from it, and winning athletes wore crowns of the foliage in Pan-Hellenic games. The seeds and fruit have long been used medicinally. "I find it intriguing that the purported medical usage of the plant is being revived today, but is instead extracted from the vegetative parts," Dr. Davis said in an email interview.

Will celery juice hurt you?
"There's nothing in it that's going to hurt you," Dr. Levitsky said. Celery can have a slight diuretic effect, which may increase urination and reduce some bloat.
Nutritionists say patients should not discontinue seeing their doctor or treatment in favor of a celery juice regimen.
But there is something larger at stake, Dr. Levitsky said. Believing in miraculous remedies can leave patients vulnerable to just about anything, even harmful treatments. "It thwarts belief in science and medicine to some magical mystery cure, and there ain't no such thing," he said.
Is celery juice a scam?
"It's definitely not a 'miracle juice,"' said Rebecca Scritchfield, dietitian and author of "Body Kindness." "It can join the list of the snake oil remedies."
Mr. William, for his part, contends he is not misleading anyone; he neither owns a celery farm nor sells the juice himself. "I'm not saying it's a cure-all," he said.
Nutritionists say to drink celery juice if it is enjoyable, but don't take stock in all the claims.

Texto completo: A Times editorial

The best thing Tampa Bay leaders can do to fight climate change is simply get more cars off the road. But thats a hollow hope in a region that still lacks meaningful mass transit, and where building more toll roads is seen as progress. A sense of urgency in solving the transportation problem is no longer just about convenience and economic competitiveness  its also now about global warming. Tampa Bay is particularly vulnerable to every aspect of climate change, from sea level rise to more powerful hurricanes. Thats something to ponder while stuck in another gridlock on the Howard Frankland Bridge.

In the last 30 years, tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases, mostly carbon dioxide, have risen by more than half in the Tampa Bay area, according to an analysis from the New York Times based on data collected by Boston University. And according to new Census data, 117,000 Tampa Bay workers spend at least an hour getting to work and another hour getting home, polluting all the way  our air and even our water, when nitrogen settles out. This is lose-lose, for productivity and for the planet.

Need proof of the need to act? Here are some facts that illustrate the depth of the problem:

55 % is the increase in carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks in Tampa Bay since 1990.

2017 was the first year in which cars, trucks and SUVs began to spew more carbon dioxide than electric utilities across the nation. Utilities are cleaning up their act and reduced emissions each year in the five years leading up to 2017, the last year for which the EPA has records. But vehicle emissions rose every year in that period.

4% is the amount by which air pollution has gone up per person in the Tampa Bay area since 1990. We have more people, and each of us is polluting more, on average.

1.2 million hours is how much time Tampa Bays workforce spends commuting each day, about 30 percent more than 10 years ago.

Four out of five Tampa Bay commuters drive to work alone, clogging roads with solo drivers in a region plagued by sprawl. What happened to car pools?

18,994 take public transit to work in Tampa Bay. That doesnt sound horrible until you discover that more people walk (20,482) than take the bus.

56% of Tampa Bay workers have a commute of under 30 minutes. But in 2010, 63 percent did.

Its us. Sure, cows and coal-fired electric plants may be bad for the environment. But transport is the single worst source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States today, and our cars, trucks and SUVs are the major culprit. Nationally, we drove 46 percent more miles in 2017 than in 1990.

Until Tampa Bay leaders embrace real mass transit, this problem will only get worse.

Media meltdowns and political polarization: Joel Kotkin

Texto completo: The mainstream media increasing appears much like the classic tale of the boy who cried wolf so often that when the wolf showed up no one believed him.
Similarly, since the bust of the Mueller report, and the evaporation of countless other “blockbuster” exposés, the media’s credibility in the ongoing impeachment saga is now widely doubted, even if this time they may actually be right about presidential misdeeds.
This divide can be seen in public perceptions of the news media. Although somewhat improved from its low point in 2016, only 40 percent of Americans, according to Gallup, trust the media, compared to over 50 percent in 1999. As befits the media’s increasingly partisan stance, the small improvement over 2016 comes almost entirely from Democrats. Only 15% of Republicans and barely a third of independents now trust media compared to nearly 70% of Democrats.
Once the news business had enough sense of propriety and professionalism to at least maintain an appearance of objectivity. There’s ample reason, as Glenn Reynolds suggests, to see many mainstream journalists as little more than “Democrats with bylines,” willing participants in what long-time leftist and fiercely anti-Trump reporter Matt Taibbi describes as the upper bureaucracy’s “permanent coup” against Trump. If this “coup” now actually succeeds, it will be one that will simply accentuate hostility to the media among a large segment of the population.
Media faces an economic crisis
No president has suffered such total opposition from powerful media. In his first year in office, stories about Trump were 62 percent negative, notes Pew, almost three the rate for Obama and more than twice that for George W. Bush, certainly no media favorite. His positive coverage was barely 5 percent, one eighth that enjoyed by President Obama. Some have thrived from naked partisanship, including an increasingly aggressive series of pro-Trump outlets. The New York Times, de facto leader of the anti-Trump media lynch mob, has seen its subscriptions burgeon, notably online.
But the Times enjoys a unique status with upper-class, educated readers. In contrast the mass audience seems to be turned off with the non-stop political haranguing. The almost comically anti-Trump CNN has seen its ratings drop so far that it now trails not only primetime leaders Fox, but has fallen to 15th behind ESPN, Hallmark Channel, History, TBS and others. Overall, all forms of media — television, radio, newspapers — have been suffered double-digit drops since 2016, according to Pew.
The timing couldn’t be worse, given the economic decline of traditional media stemming from the shift to online. Google alone made $4.7 billion last year from news publishers whose industry continues to shrink, losing an estimated 40 percent of its 2001 job base.
The collapse is most evident on the local level, including local television stations whose ratings have plummeted. Over 1,800 local papers have gone out of existence since 2004, notes a recent University of North Carolina study, and many more have stripped their staffing levels, creating numerous “news deserts” across the country.
The decline in local coverage, suggests the Nieman Lab at Harvard, has been filled by national partisan online media, giving ever more influence to media based in New York, Washington and San Francisco.
The new sociology of media
In the past independent, or at least quirky, voices could emerge from the hinterlands. When I was a young reporter, papers like the Kansas City Star, the Louisville Courier and the old Los Angeles Herald Examiner were well-staffed, great dailies that not only covered news, but often with a very different perspective than the large coastal media.
Even in places like New York and Washington, the editorial workforce has been transformed, in part because of high housing costs. The journalist of the 1980s was often a middle-class homeowner who could afford to live in the suburbs of New York and Washington. My neighbor at the Washington Post was a hard-drinking Italian working-class guy whose brother was a Baltimore cop.
Today that kind of working-class journalist has been replaced by younger reporters who often hail from elite universities. These young journalists, as Obama speechwriter Ben Rhodes noted, did not have to cover city councils and other boring local minutiae, leaping directly from graduate school into major newspapers and radio and television outlets. They may be good test-takers, but literally know nothing about the real world that people unlike themselves inhabit.
Overall, the new breed of reporters almost universally follow the progressive party line. In 2018, barely 7 percent of U.S. reporters identified themselves as Republicans; some 97 percent of journalists’ political donations go to Democrats.
But the new class order in journalism is not just a problem for conservatives. The gaping chasm between the elite journalists and working-class people, suggest left-leaning sociologists John Russo and Sheri Linkon, leads reporters to blame small-town residents and rural people for Trump without taking time to actually examine their voting behavior, life experience and attitudes.
Ahead: A troubled future
It was widely hoped the internet would forge an ever more diverse media. Yet, so far, we see a sad trend to homogeneity. This is likely to get worse as the tech oligarchs expand their control of media pipelines and continue to purchase major publications that were once proud exemplars of independent American journalism.
This takeover could become downright scary, particularly if there is a change of parties in Washington. There are growing calls, notably in The New York Times, to have Washington limit media that might appeal to the unhinged elements of the alt-right; progressives in some states, including New Jersey, have even called for the creation of state-supported media, not exactly something healthy for a democracy built on free speech and open discussion.
Many in media hope non-stop impeachment coverage, or continued unraveling of Trump’s inner circle, will both revive their fortunes and expel the hated Trump. The murky events in Ukraine also could undermine the credibility of the fledgling pro-Trump media, which could lead to even greater media homogeneity.
The emerging impeachment saga is likely to accelerate not only the alienation of much of the population from the press, but also create challenges for our democracy. With the demise of press diversity and openness, readers will be increasingly faced with a media that barely hides its prejudices, but instead offers largely alternative realities that may be only occasionally real and rarely edifying.

Texto completo: After being captured by Mexican forces, the Sinaloa cartel managed to wrest El Chappo's son free from government control with a stunning show of force complete with machine guns and rocket launchers.
The events unfolded in the city of Culiacán on Thursday after troops captured the son of jailed drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo. His son, Ovidio Guzmán Lopez, is one of many of the notorious kingpin’s children who live in the area. Another one of El Chapo’s sons called up cartel members to begin a siege on Culiacán, according to the New York Times.
Trucks with large mounted machine guns were spotted, as were videos showing rocket launchers and rocket-powered grenades. Many civilians in the city were able to capture the staccato of gunfire during the prolonged battle, which ended in the deaths of at least seven and injured more than a dozen.
The Mexican forces who arrested the younger Guzmán released him after eight of their members were taken hostage. Part of the effort by the cartel to get Guzmán released reportedly included not only taking armed forces hostage, but also kidnapping their families.
Given that they were surrounded, the violence was continuing to rise, and there were hostages, the government surrendered and let Guzmán go.
“Decisions were made that I support, that I endorse because the situation turned very bad and lots of citizens were at risk, lots of people and it was decided to protect the life of the people,” said President Andrés Manuel López Obrador on Friday. “You cannot value the life of a delinquent more than the lives of the people.”
Raúl Benítez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said that this another example of extreme violence displayed by the cartels this year. He criticized the president for his decision to pull back and surrender to the cartel.
“The government was forced to accept the cartel’s control over the city and not confront them,” Benítez said. “To the people of Culiacán, the president is sending a very tough message: The cartel is in charge here.”
Videos captured the violence unfolding and were posted on social media.

Texto completo: A captain in the National Guard who served alongside Kurdish forces in Syria said that President Trump’s decision to pull troops from the country was “immoral” and “un-American.”
In a video by the New York Times, Capt. Alan Kennedy of the Colorado Army National Guard blasted Trump’s decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria, which paved the way for a Turkish attack against the Kurds in the region, who were allied with America in the fight against the Islamic State.
“Weeks ago, our commander in chief announced he was pulling our last troops out of the region. Ever since, I haven’t been able to sleep at night,” Kennedy said.
“Our complete withdrawal from Syria is unstrategic, immoral, and ultimately un-American,” he added.
Kennedy said that he supports pulling troops out of the Middle East but argued that the way it was done was irresponsible and put U.S. allies in harm’s way. He said he agreed with Trump’s view on ending “endless wars” but added that the way to properly do so is by “building and maintaining alliances, by creating a peace process that maintains stability in the region, and supporting our allies.”
“I met a Kurdish fighter who asked me if the U.S. would ever leave Syria. I reassured him, ‘Of course the U.S. would never leave Syria and abandon the Kurds.’ They’re our partners,” Kennedy said. “I was wrong."
“I can’t believe President Trump let this happen,” he added.

Trump faced criticism on both sides of the aisle after he announced his decision to relocate troops in Syria to allow a Turkish invasion to commence. He later abruptly withdrew about 1,000 troops from the region. Trump said Thursday that Turkish and Kurdish forces have agreed to a ceasefire that includes Kurdish forces withdrawing from an approximately 20-mile “safe zone” in Syria along the Turkish border.

Democrats, don't be fooled by the 'Hillbilly Elegy' image. Ohio is worth fighting for.

Resumen: Democrats would be foolish to concede Ohio to the Republicans without a robust campaign here in 2020. "Hillbilly Elegy" isn't the state I know.

Texto completo: During a brainstorming session in a presidential campaign headquarters this spring to plan a weeklong swing through the Buckeye State, a young, West Coast-bred member of the communications team said to the group I was leading, "We tend to think of Ohio as a sad place. "
Right away I realized J. D. Vance inadvertently propelled that belief nationwide with his 2016 bestseller, "Hillbilly Elegy. "
I tore through the book. I liked it. I respect the way Vance built his career and his efforts to bring venture capital back home. But a side effect of his book sales did a disservice to the great state of Ohio.
What he describes is not the state I know, and it’s not the way I grew up.
That’s not to say the problems Vance encountered don’t exist. We desperately need to find ways to combat the opioid epidemic and close the skills gap.
Fortunately, Ohio has the tools and resources to do both of those things, and those assets are what make the state a vibrant, dynamic one that America should view as a destination and example for so many others. It’s an economic powerhouse Democrats would be foolish to concede without a robust campaign, though rumors abound in Washington, D. C. , that the party doesn’t plan to compete here in 2020.
Ohio isn't all "Hillbilly Elegy"
What it may need now is a marketing campaign to change the ingrained impression Vance wrought.
Here’s a start: According to Boss Magazine, Ohio is the fifth-ranking state in the nation for the number of Fortune 500 headquarters with 25, behind the standard behemoths of New York, Texas, California and our midwestern neighbor, Illinois. Those Ohio companies generate $644. 5 million in annual revenue, and that’s a full $240 million more per year than the next state on the list, New Jersey.
The hardest column I ever had to write: I went back home to Ohio's Trump country. In Appalachia, honest people have hope again.
Columbus ranks near the top on all kinds of city lists for entrepreneurial growth and startup hiring and sustainability — and it has since at least 2016, before Vance jumped into venture funding.
You’d think we’d be able to do something about jobs and the economy.
The Cincinnati and Cleveland VA Medical Centers are among the country’s best. The medical schools at the University of Cincinnati, Ohio State University and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland are all ranked in the top 40 by U. S. News and World Report. Outside of Ohio, people know of the Cleveland Clinic, but in my anecdotal experience, they are entirely unaware of the sprawling Health-Tech Corridor surrounding it that has become a world-class destination for the medical community.
You’d think we’d be able to do something about the health care industry and opioids.
Declaring war on rural America: Democrats want to close churches, raise taxes and pay for sex reassignment surgery. Great.
And every time the New York Times comes to town, they leave slack-jawed over the revelation that Cincinnati is an artsy city. When should we tell them it’s exceptionally musical, too? (How often I tell my East Coast friends about Music Hall, the Aronoff Center, Playhouse in the Park, the College-Conservatory of Music, that the Cincinnati Symphony is a feeder for the Boston Pops, May Festival Chorus. And that’s to say nothing of the emerging music scene. )
Can you imagine what any of the "coastal elite" might say when they learn that Columbus ranks No. 3 in the United States for its concentration of fashion designers, behind only New York and Los Angeles? They scoff.
Why would Democrats cede any of this economic clout and creative energy to the Republican Party?

ELIZABETH WARREN IS AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT TO THE U.S. ECONOMY

Texto completo: With three polls showing her in the lead, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., may soon eclipse former vice president Joe Biden as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. That's great news for Republicans, because Ms. Warren has a problem: The central message of her campaign is that the economy is working for the very wealthy but it is not working for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately for her, ordinary Americans disagree.
A Marist poll asked voters whether "the economy is working well for you personally." Nearly two-thirds of Americans said yes. This includes large majorities in almost every demographic group. Sixty-seven percent of college graduates and 64% of those without a college education say the economy is working for them.
So do 68% of whites, and 61% of nonwhite people.
So do Americans of every generation: 63% of Generation Z and millennials; 69% of Generation X; 63% of baby boomers; and 69% of Greatest Generation and Silent Generation voters.
So do supermajorities in every region in the country: 60% in the West, 65% in the Northeast, 67% in the Midwest, and 68% in the South.
So do most voters in every type of American community: 63% of both big and small city voters; 64% of small-town voters; 66% of rural voters; and 72% of suburban voters.
Most everyone, it seems, says the economy is working for them.
The only groups who disagree, Marist found, are progressives (59%), Democratic women (55%) and those who are liberal or very liberal (55%). So, when Ms. Warren declares that President Donald Trump is "part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else," it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left.
There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And The New York Times reported in May that "over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases." Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.
This progress is bad news for Ms. Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for "big structural change" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Ms. Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and - whether she admits it or not - would require them to pay more in taxes?
Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Ms. Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. "Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion," Mr. Riedl says. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Ms. Warren supports. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Ms. Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.
No wonder the so-called moderates were going after Ms. Warren so hard at Tuesday's debate; they know it would be a disaster if she were to capture the Democratic nomination. To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Mr. Trump's policies but don't like Mr. Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Mr. Trump and still keep their prosperity.
If Democrats nominate Ms. Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And because Ms. Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected and Democrats take back the Senate, they will "repeal the filibuster," she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Mr. Trump's message - "whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me" - will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.

Taiwan Urges Hong Kong To Investigate 2018 Killing

Texto completo: A suspect in a Taiwan murder could be released in days. The case led to the extradition bill that set off Hong Kong's protest movement.
HONG KONG -- The suspect in a murder case that helped trigger the biggest political crisis in Hong Kong in decades has said he would turn himself in to the authorities in Taiwan, where he is wanted, the Hong Kong government said Friday.
The suspect, Chan Tong-kai, told the Hong Kong police that while on a Valentine's Day trip to Taiwan last year with his girlfriend, Poon Hiu-wing, he strangled her, stuffed her body into a suitcase and hid it near a subway station in Taipei.
Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan, a self-ruled island democracy. The Hong Kong government cited Ms. Poon's killing, and the obstacles to sending Mr. Chan to Taiwan, when it introduced legislation in February that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to places with which it does not have extradition treaties.
That set off huge protests because one such place is mainland China, where the murky judicial system is under the control of the Communist Party.
Mr. Chan, who is now in a Hong Kong prison on a money laundering conviction, says he has decided to surrender himself to Taiwan after his release, the government of Hong Kong said in a statement on Friday. The statement added that the authorities would assist Mr. Chan in doing so.
Taiwan's Ministry of Justice, however, called on the Hong Kong authorities to keep investigating Mr. Chan. In a statement Thursday, it noted that both the victim and the alleged killer were from Hong Kong and said other aspects of the crime may have happened in the city, including the planning of the killing.
Hong Kong's chief executive, Carrie Lam, said last month that she would withdraw the bill, but protests have morphed into broader demands that include expanding direct elections and an investigation into the police's use of force against demonstrators.
A march is planned in the Kowloon area of Hong Kong on Sunday to press for those demands, although the police have officially objected to it. Protesters also plan to call for a reorganization of the police force and an end to the ban on masks that Mrs. Lam recently enacted, using emergency powers, in an effort to tamp down the demonstrations.
In its statement Thursday, Taiwan said it would provide evidence in Mr. Chan's case on a "foundation of equal status, dignity and mutual benefit." Taiwan had previously said it would not agree to Mr. Chan's extradition under the contentious legislation, on the grounds that the bill would have treated the self-governed island as a part of China.
Mr. Chan has been serving a 29-month sentence for money laundering because he took some of his girlfriend's valuables and used her credit card upon returning to Hong Kong. With good behavior, his sentence will be shortened, and he is expected to be released as soon as Wednesday.

Texto completo: She led the deliberations to grant Bob Dylan the Nobel. When she was ousted after a sex scandal in which she was not involved, thousands rallied to her defense.
Sara Danius, who was the first woman to lead the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature, and who was ousted in the aftermath of a sexual abuse and harassment scandal that roiled the academy, died on Oct. 12 in Stockholm. She was 57.
The cause was breast cancer, which was diagnosed six years ago, her mother, the author Anna Wahlgren, said on Facebook.
Ms. Danius, a literary scholar, professor and writer, was the permanent secretary of the academy from 2015 to 2018. As such, she played a central role in the hotly debated decision in 2016 to bestow the world's most prestigious award for literature on a musician, Bob Dylan.
But a sex scandal the next year, when 18 women accused a board member's husband of sexual assault, overshadowed the Dylan dust-up and led to Ms. Danius's departure.
She herself was never accused of wrongdoing. But she was the public face of a global institution whose reputation had been severely damaged.
Behind the scenes, her enemies within the academy sought to protect the accused man. They resisted her attempts to bring in law enforcement and forced her out.
When she left, Ms. Danius acknowledged that her colleagues had lost confidence in her leadership. She also defiantly suggested that arrogant and anachronistic forces within the academy had invoked the institution's traditions to deny accountability.
"Not all traditions are worth preserving," she said.
Her abrupt departure infuriated many women -- and many men as well -- across Sweden, a country that prides itself on gender equality. She was widely viewed as a scapegoat.
As a New York Times headline put it: "In Nobel Scandal, a Man Is Accused of Sexual Misconduct. A Woman Takes the Fall."
Thousands of people rallied to support her in public demonstrations and on social media. In a show of solidarity, many wore a garment favored by the fashion-conscious Ms. Danius -- the pussy-bow blouse, or knytblus, in which a flowing wide tie is knotted at the neck. Considered the professional woman's alternative to the suit and tie, the blouse was worn in the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher and Nancy Reagan and more recently by Melania Trump.
The scandal, driven in part by the #MeToo movement sweeping the United States, set off recriminations and power struggles within the academy. Amid the turmoil, several of the 18 board members left their chairs. And in 2018, for the first time since World War II, no Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded.
The literature prize has a long history of controversy. The academy has tended to favor Europeans, often Swedes and especially men, and has frequently honored obscure writers rather than towering literary figures.
In 2016 it drew plenty of fire for awarding the literature prize to Mr. Dylan; it was the first time a songwriter was so honored. Ms. Danius was pivotal in that selection, but the deliberations that lead to the selection of recipients are kept secret for 50 years, and she revealed little about it in her book "On Bob Dylan."
When she announced the award, Ms. Danius cited Mr. Dylan "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition."
The award horrified many in the literary world, who maintained that song lyrics were not literature.
Ms. Danius defended the choice, telling reporters, "He's a great poet in the great English tradition, stretching from Milton and Blake onwards." Mr. Dylan worked in the oral tradition, she added, like Homer and Sappho, whose works were meant to be performed, often with instruments, and whose art has survived well on the printed page.
Sara Danius was born on April 5, 1962, in Taby, north of Stockholm. As a child she moved frequently with her mother, Ms. Wahlgren, who had nine children, of whom Sara was the oldest. Ms. Wahlgren, who was married and divorced seven times, was nonetheless acclaimed in Europe in the 1980s for her popular child-rearing manual, "For the Love of Children," which was published in English in 2009.
When Sara was 11, she moved to Taby to live with her father, Lars Danius, a teacher and author.
She studied at Stockholm University, graduating in 1986, then established herself as a literary critic. After further studies in France, England and the United States, where she received her doctorate in literature from Duke University in 1997, she was appointed professor of aesthetics at Sodertorn University in Stockholm. In 2013 she was named professor of literature at Stockholm University. She wrote extensively about modernist aesthetics and also about Proust, Flaubert and Joyce.
Ms. Danius married Stefan Jonsson, an author, in 1989; the marriage ended in divorce in 2010. In addition to her mother, survivors include her son, Leo; six of her seven sisters; and one brother.
Ms. Danius was installed at the Swedish Academy in 2013 and became permanent secretary in June 2015. After stepping down from that position, she retained her seat in the academy until she resigned last February.
The man at the center of the sex scandal, Jean-Claude Arnault, was found guilty last year of raping a woman in 2011 and sentenced to two years in jail. In his appeal of the verdict, the appeals court found him guilty of raping the same woman twice and extended his sentence.
In addition, his wife, Katarina Frostenson, a poet who resigned from the academy, was accused of leaking the names of prize recipients to Mr. Arnault on at least seven occasions so that their friends could profit from bets. The two have denied all charges and said they were the objects of a witch hunt.
The academy underwent extensive restructuring after the scandal. This year, it named two Nobel laureates in literature -- the Austrian writer Peter Handke and the Polish novelist Olga Tokarczuk -- to make up for the absence of the award in 2018.
Mr. Handke's selection drew fresh outrage: In 2006 he had eulogized Slobodan Milosevic, the former leader of Yugoslavia who was on trial for war crimes.
Ms. Danius left the academy before the decision was announced to award two literature prizes. But she told reporters that she disagreed with the decision. She suggested that the year 2018 should have been left blank, without a recipient -- "out of respect," she said, "for the women who became victims."

Let's Make Whistle-Blowing Obligatory

Texto completo: New York City requires its employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing, and that approach is working.
Over the past few weeks, the country has been riveted by the news of a whistle-blower within the intelligence community who filed a formal complaint alleging wrongdoing by President Trump. In turn, we have watched the whistle-blower defamed by the president and his allies, even accused of treason, despite his having meticulously followed the lawful process to report possible criminal conduct. This took remarkable courage. There was no legal obligation to report it, and there were serious risks to career, reputation and even personal safety for doing so.
We know from the work we did as prosecutors and investigators that whistle-blowers are essential to exposing corruption and holding the corrupt accountable. But with few exceptions, the law imposes no general obligation on citizens to report criminal activity to authorities. A "duty to report" is rare in American law. Mostly you may simply avert your eyes, keep your mouth shut and suffer no consequence. The rare exceptions concern particularly vulnerable populations like children, which is why teachers, doctors and other caregivers have a legal obligation to report credible evidence of child abuse.
As with child abuse, public corruption happens in the shadows and is notoriously difficult to uncover, investigate and prosecute. In our experience, uncovering such behavior and holding public officials accountable depends on fellow public servants blowing the whistle. The broader culture can encourage this. But as we have seen in the past three years, norms and unwritten rules about conduct in public life -- even those that once seemed immutable -- are only as durable as the people who choose to live, or not live, by them. That's a weak foundation for guarding against breaches of the public trust.
Now consider a system in which there is an obligation to report corruption, to point a finger at waste, fraud and abuse. You don't have to imagine it, because New York City government imposes an uncommon obligation on public servants, requiring them to report wrongdoing or jeopardize their jobs and professional advancement if they do not.
The city has a long and storied history of public corruption scandals. But out of that history grew this unusual and effective rule for combating corruption. An executive order, first issued by Mayor Ed Koch in 1978 and ratified by every mayor since, directs that all New York City employees have an obligation to report to the city's independent Department of Investigation any instance of corruption, waste, fraud or abuse by public officials or city contractors. Failure to report can be cause for discipline or termination.
The law arose after scandals within city government went unchecked, despite city employees' having knowledge of the corruption that fueled them. All city employees now receive regular anti-corruption training from the D.O.I. that underscores the obligation to report wrongdoing as well as the legal protections they have when they do report.
New York City is far from perfect, but this distinctive rule has borne extraordinary fruit. Many of the most significant criminal cases that the D.O.I. has investigated began with, or were greatly enhanced by, information reported by city employees or contractors -- including cases prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York during our time there. These include the CityTime scandal, in which executives at the Science Applications International Corporation bilked New York City out of half a billion dollars, and the sweeping investigation into day care providers known as Operation Pay Care, which exposed a million-dollar fraud and resulted in the convictions of 15 people, including seven city employees. New York City's duty to report has helped law enforcement expose corrupt public officials and those who seek to corrupt them.
A duty to report may at first seem to only add to the dilemma facing a would-be whistle-blower, but that duty, combined with protections for those who act on it, creates a kind of virtuous cycle. A statutory duty normalizes the reporting of wrongdoing and lessens the stigma of doing so. Rules can operate to shape culture, not just punish, and a culture in which the rules are well known supports their efficacy and makes compliance easier. It would be ideal if all government employees had the courage to voluntarily report wrongdoing. And an ethical culture can certainly help make such reporting more likely. But New York City's experience shows that we need not rely solely on personal bravery, or on changing people's hearts, to have effective systems that can alert us to public corruption and fraud.
Just in the past month, the D.O.I. began two criminal investigations based on calls from city employees who were offered bribes. One of the calls emphasized the power behind the mandatory reporting rule. In making the report, the employee noted that he thought the bribe offer might be an "integrity test" by his employer, and he knew that if it was, it would not be enough to save his job to simply decline the bribe, as he did, but that to pass the test, he was also required to notify D.O.I. of the attempted bribe. One might hope that all public employees would be offended by the offer of a bribe and would report such conduct. But moral impulses are not always enough to combat corruption, and the calculus becomes markedly harder when the wrongdoing is not as stark as a bribe and the wrongdoer is not a stranger but a trusted colleague or an influential supervisor or a powerful elected official.
Insiders willing to report wrongdoing are vital to the fight against public corruption. It takes fortitude to come forward, even when you are required to do so. Those of us who believe in the promise and ideal of honest self-government have an obligation to support a process for whistle-blowers that helps diminish the amount of bravery and self-sacrifice required. Mandatory reporting can work. It has contributed tremendously to changing the culture on child abuse, and in New York City it has exposed public corruption while making investigating and prosecuting it easier.
Whatever the outcome of the current impeachment inquiry, it should begin a conversation about how to encourage government whistle-blowers to come forward, just as the aftermath of the Watergate scandal was the impetus for institutional reforms and safeguards. A duty to report deserves a place in that conversation.
Margaret Garnett became commissioner of New York City's Department of Investigation in December. She spent 12 years as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where Preet Bharara was the United States attorney from 2009 to 2017.

Priceless Rodin Museum hides in plain sight

Texto completo: Hidden in plain sight behind shadowy trees along the Ben Franklin Parkway, Philadelphia's Rodin Museum is so unique that it's basically priceless.
A gift to the city from a theater magnate in the 1920s, the institution maintains pay-what-you-wish admission, which welcomes visitors to a rotating art collection so lauded and expansive curators find it hard to cite its exact monetary value.
The museum is also representative of one of the most Francophile experiences in the United States.
It's built from a limestone nicknamed "Paris stone" following a plan by French-born Philadelphian Paul Cret. French landscape architect lacques-Henri-Auguste Gréber, the man who fashioned the Parkway after the Champs-Élysées in Paris, was also involved in its design.
In front of the museum's grounds and garden - behind the famous "Thinker" - is a replica of a giant marble and iron gate sculptor Auguste Rodin built at his own home in France. Walk through it to get to the building's stunning entrance, home to the first-ever bronze cast of Rodin's famous "Gates of Hell." It's one of only three original casts in the world.
Other than that, Rodin's estate in the Parisian suburb of Meudon is home to a near-carbon copy of the Philadelphia museum. Both projects were funded by Jules Mastbaum, a Philadelphia movie tycoon with an eye (and budget) for the luxurious.
"He seemed to think that there was value in bringing high French art into American spaces," said Alexander Kauffman, curator of the current exhibition at the Philly museum.
A new bond with France'
The year was 1929. The Philadelphia Athletics baseball team had just won the World Series over the Chicago Cubs. Two weeks after that championship, Black Monday happened, setting off the greatest economic depression in modern American history.
But just one month later, the $2 million Rodin Museum opened on Ben Franklin Parkway with great fanfare. At least 2,000 people, including the French ambassador, came to witness one of Philadelphia's greatest artistic spectacles to date.
A Philadelphia Inquirer article called the museum "the most important collection of Rodiniana in America." A New York Times piece highlighted the museum opening as "a new bond with France."
Mastbaum had the resources to make it happen. He owned more than 200 movie houses - fancy ones. In 1926, a series of five new theaters were expected to cost more than $1,500,000 each. That's equivalent to almost $22 million each today.
The theater mogul first acquired works from Rodin during a trip to Paris in 1923, six years after Rodin's death. He returned repeatedly, picking up more and more of the French sculptor's work. During one such trip in 1926, Mastbaum reportedly returned to the states with hundreds of the artist's papers and more than 245 works - 40 of which were gifted by the French government.
Said Mastbaum at the time: "[T]here was an eager desire that the culture and thought of France should be interpreted through the mighty chisel of France to America."
The businessman died in 1926, three years before he could see his Parisian vision come to life in his native Philadelphia.
His widow, Etta Mastbaum, carried out the rest of the arrangements, overseeing the construction and opening of the museum. Though there's no indication of her work inside the structure - some say she didn't want to be commemorated, preferring to give her husband the glory, "we really have her to thank," said Kauffman, the museum curator.
What deserves a monument?
Mastbaum's bust rests against a wall in the center of the museum, which is so tiny that a tour could be completed in about 45 minutes.
His full collection doesn't fit into the small museum all at once. It's also extremely hard to price, museum representatives said, because of the extent of its holding and an ever-fluctuating art market. It's pretty much irreplicable.
"You couldn't form this collection today," Kauffman said, "even if you wanted to."
Now 90 years old, the museum underwent a significant, four-year renovation and deep cleaning that saw it temporarily closed before relaunching in 2012 with a host of changes.
Instead of remaining stagnant, the collection now rotates every two years. Also new is a seasonal garden bar where guests can enjoy drinks and an after-hours tour. The effort has boosted visitorship, museum reps said - which was already high after a surge in 2017, the centennial anniversary of Rodin's death.
Currently on display is an exhibition curated by Kauffman called, "Rethinking the Modern Monument."
Opened in February, it's the first in the museum's history to feature work from artists other than its namesake. It combines some of Rodin's most ostracized pieces with works inspired by him to explore at a longstanding question - What should be monumentalized, and how? - in the context of recent conversations about removing confederate statues and the debate over Philly's controversial Frank Rizzo likeness.
It's a fitting vibe for a museum in the heart of the city that's been around for decades and yet still manages to feel like a new discovery.

Texto completo: Love, it is said, can come in many forms.
There is romantic love, love between a parent and child and between best friends. And then there are a good many that are harder to define. And a few are explored to entertaining effect in a smart new comedy anthology series dropping this week on Amazon.
"Modern Love," inspired by the popular New York Times column of the same name and premiering Friday, Oct. 18, looks at love in all of its complicated forms, with each episode brought to life by an impressive cast, including Anne Hathaway, Cristin Milioti, Gary Carr, Catherine Keener, Andy Garcia, Tina Fey, John Slattery and Sofia Boutella.
The opening episode, titled "When the Doorman Is Your Main Man," introduces us to young New York singleton Maggie (Milioti), whose everyday comings and goings are observed by her apartment building’s doorman, Guzmin (Laurentiu Possa). He’s a former Albanian sniper with a protective streak and an eye for character, and what he sees in some of Maggie’s dates, he doesn’t like. And he tells her so.
"I was really touched by the nuance of it," Milioti says of the storyline. "And it wasn’t romantic love. It was a love you couldn’t put your finger on. And I was really touched by her, too, because I feel like there’s multiple love stories that go on within it. It’s her and the love with the doorman, platonic but also father/daughter, also something you can’t quite put your finger on. ...
"And then I think ... it’s a love story between her and herself," she continues, "that she tried to conform to be what other people wanted her to be, like on all those failed dates, dumbing herself down and going out with guys who weren’t even listening to her. And she makes this really brave decision and she sees it through and she comes into her own."
A subsequent episode, titled "Take Me as I Am, Whoever I Am," deals with mental illness as told through the story of Lexi (Hathaway), a bipolar woman we meet as she’s going food shopping at 7 a.m., dressed to the nines and feeling so good about herself there is a production number complete with leaping dancers going on behind her. There, she encounters Jeff (Carr), a nice guy who shares her sense of humor. They hit it off and agree to go out on a date. And then her disorder asserts itself.
"It’s this huge block in Lexi’s life," Hathaway says, "and she talks about that. She talks about just needing one person, just one person to accept all of her. And that’s really what we all, I think, want. And she gets it. She doesn’t get it from the person that, I think, any of us expect her to get it from in the beginning of the episode. But that one person giving her the space, being patient, being compassionate, and being a true, loving person in her life changes everything for her. It gives her hope and gives her a future."

Texto completo: To many people, Anthony Bourdain was more than a chef, he was a world traveler and storyteller with a passion for music, watches and art spanning all cultures and regions. Bourdain admirers can now take a glimpse into his diverse life interests at Savannah's Everard Auctions and Appraisals.
Located at 2436 Waters
Ave., the auction house currently has 10 items on display from Bourdain's personal collection that are part of the Property from the Collection of Anthony Bourdain, a 215-piece online auction hosted by Lark Mason Associates through iGavel Auctions.
"The objects are stories in themselves and they tell a lot about his life and in them sending us a group of these items they tried to represent different areas," said Amanda Everard, president of the Savannah auction house.
The items on display at Everard include several cufflink sets, sunglasses, an African carved wood figure, Ralph Steadman print, Jacques Pepin painting, tribal pigmented wood mask, a Verve cardboard record case with a collection of vinyl records, Latin American carved wood figure of a Pre-Colombian warrior and a Tom Ford tuxedo.
"He really enjoyed things that were well-made and had a story to them," Everard said.
The online auction runs through Oct. 30 and is divided into categories that reflect Bourdain's wide variety of interests: film, art, cooking, travel, writing and world culture.
Some of the highlights of the overall collection includes a custom steel-and-meteorite chef's knife crafted for Bourdain by Master Bladesmith Bob Kramer. As of Thursday, the knife was the highest-priced item with a leading bid of $21,000.
"He also used it and that was the cool thing. He didn't just have objects around that he wasn't going to enjoy and use," Everard said of the knife, which is on display in New York.
Other notable items include a chrome duck press from the Paris episode of Bourdain's show "The Layover," which aired from 2011 to 2013 on the Travel Channel, with a bid of $9,250. A group of early writings by Bourdain, including the original idea for his New York Times best-selling book "Kitchen Confidential," which has a bid of $4,100. A white chef's jacket worn by Bourdain for a cameo in the film "The Big Short" is listed for $1,300.
If you can't spare thousands of dollars for a bit of Bourdain history, there are several items, including an Alfred Brown blazer, Tom Ford suit and various pieces of furniture, that as of Thursday were listed for under $200.
"It's a little bit of everything. He was such an interesting guy," Everard said.
"The objects that were chosen to be sold really tell his story, and he was a great storyteller. That's what drew us all in."
For Everard a pair of silver skull cufflinks, which are being sold alongside another pair of silver disk cufflinks, stand out among the pieces on display at the auction house.
"They're so persona," she said of the cufflink set, which has a current bid of $950.
"Things that you wear on your person, it says something. It's sort of a glimpse into the person."
All items from the collection, including the ones on display in Savannah, can be bid on at igavelauctions.com through Oct. 30. You can view the 10 items at Everard by appointment through Oct. 25 or at a public viewing scheduled for Oct. 28 through 30.
"We feel really lucky to be the ones here who get to take this on and bring it to people here locally," Everard said of Bourdain's collection.
"Because he traveled and was so famous he was given hundreds of things over the years, so the things that actually made it into his home are things that he cared about and they meant something to him."
A portion of the auction's proceeds will benefit the Anthony Bourdain Legacy Scholarship at his alma mater, The Culinary Institute of America. The scholarship was established to support CIA students pursuing a semester abroad or taking part in one of the college's global cuisines and cultures international programs.
The remaining proceeds will go to Bourdain's estate. Bourdain died in 2018 in Paris. He was 61.

U. of I., stung by #MeToo probe, using Title IX to muzzle reporters

Texto completo: Rachel Otwell, a reporter for NPR Illinois, does not have the celebrity of Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor of The New York Times, or Ronan Farrow of The New Yorker, the reporters who broke the Harvey Weinstein story and made the #MeToo movement go viral.
Otwell currently does not enjoy the same First Amendment protections those journalists have, either.
That's because the University of Illinois, which holds the NPR Illinois license for WUIS FM-91.9 in Springfield, has essentially issued an order that prevents Otwell from doing her work.
Otwell is facing this attempted restraint because, like many journalists in these days of #MeToo, she has found alleged harassment on her beat. This summer, Otwell exposed the University of Illinois' deplorable handling of sexual misconduct complaints on campus. And she did so knowing the U. of I. holds the license for her radio station.
It even cuts Otwell's paycheck.
Despite all that, in a monthslong fellowship with ProPublica Illinois, she worked with ProPublica reporter Alex Mierjeski to reveal the University of Illinois' pattern of callous response to complaints. It allowed professors who had violated the school's sexual misconduct policy to maintain unblemished professional records, to be paid while on suspension and even to find new jobs elsewhere without any warning to their new employer.
The university, to its credit, did not attempt to prevent publication of Otwell's original stories. But when she began seeking to identify new cases, through an online questionnaire asking alleged victims to come forward, the university had had enough.
The U. of I. warned WUIS management last week that all its employees -- including Otwell -- are required to disclose the name of anyone on campus who reports sexual harassment to them under the federal government's Title IX code.
Title IX, which was passed in 1972, guards against gender discrimination and harassment in education. It first helped bring millions of women into school sports, then morphed into a tool for defending against sexual harassment.
The U. of I. Springfield requirements, as laid out in its "Title IX and Sexual Misconduct Policy," are specific. The moment Otwell or any other "responsible employee" hears of harassment, they have 48 hours to report the claim to the university. They must provide the name of the complainant, too.
Read "She Said" by Twohey and Kantor, or "Catch and Kill" by Farrow, and it is evident just how completely such a Title IX disclosure requirement would muzzle a reporter's efforts. The books recount cases where reporters patiently pursued multiple trust-building meetings, referrals from acquaintances, background discussions and even legal advice before alleged victims would go on the record.
Ordering Otwell to immediately report the name of alleged victims would be tantamount to a stop work order for a most essential part of her investigative work. Predatory professors and indifferent university administrators could sleep easier, their secrets safer, courtesy of Title IX.
The paradoxes of the U. of I. case are multilayered and rich. The university did too little to protect victims of sexual harassment in the first place. Stirred to action by a reporter, it is turning the nation's anti-harassment code into a cudgel to prevent that reporter from bringing additional harassment cases to light.
No wonder the university's ethics officer twisted into rhetorical knots in the effort to advise NPR Illinois that even its reporters must promptly disclose the names of harassment complainants. In an email to the station, the school proclaimed that it "values journalistic integrity, freedom of the press, and the legal protections that exist to advance those interests" -- even as it took steps to undermine each of the above.
"Having reviewed the legal and policy implications at issue," the ethics officer's email continues, "the university has determined that requiring journalist employees to adhere to the 'responsible employee' reporting requirements would not violate any constitutional or other legal protections."
That argument misreads the First Amendment. While there apparently is no clear case law -- yet -- weighing First Amendment rights against reporting requirements under Title IX, the U.S. Supreme Court has found the government cannot require employees to forgo their free speech rights in order to keep their jobs.
"Public employees do not renounce their citizenship when they accept employment, and this Court has cautioned time and again that public employers may not condition employment on the relinquishment of constitutional rights," Justice Sonya Sotomayor wrote in a 2014 case, Lane v. Franks, according to an article on the Poynter Institute website.
In other words, NPR Illinois still has its free press rights, and Rachel Otwell has the same right to shield her confidential sources as other reporters do, even though the U. of I. holds the radio station's license.
But the debate over Otwell's further reporting should not need to come down to a First Amendment fight. Instead, common sense should win the day. The U. of I. could take action on its own.
Title IX gives employers discretion on how to implement its disclosure requirements. The U. of I. already grants an exception for "confidential advisors," who provide counseling to sexual harassment victims. Universities in other states have created exemptions for reporters or remained silent on the matter.
It would make sense for the U. of I. to grant exemptions for journalists too. After all, journalists have professional experience in protecting confidentiality, are skilled at building trust, are motivated to encourage complainants to come forward and have no reason to protect the university's interests over the victim's.
In addition to that, state and federal legislation may be needed to protect student media. No reporter or editor at any public school should be required to surrender to that school's effort to constrain their reporting just to do their jobs.
If Title IX is designed to help protect people from harassment, the more protections they have, the better. Granting exemptions to reporters such as Otwell, so they can help victims by exposing harassment, would be a step in a direction the U. of I. itself wants to go.

Texto completo: Vashti Harrison is the writer and illustrator behind best-selling children's books such as "Little Leaders: Bold Women in Black History." The picture book she made with the Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, "Sulwe," is out this week, telling the story of a little girl who learns to love her "skin the color of midnight." Earlier this year, Harrison worked with the writer and filmmaker Matthew A. Cherry on "Hair Love," a picture book that grew out of a short film about an African-American girl whose father does her hair while her mother is in the hospital.
Harrison, 31, invited us to her studio in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood to talk about her creative process, blending traditional and digital media, and how she pushes against stereotypes in her work. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
What made you choose this space?
I moved into this apartment specifically so that I could have a large, light-filled space. I work digitally, and light isn't actually the best thing for that! But it's good for my well-being.
How long have you been living and working here?
I moved to this apartment in May of 2017, but I've been in New York since 2016. When I first got here from Virginia, where I grew up and went to college, it was sort of a temporary period to see if I liked being in New York. And I did, so I looked for an apartment I could really settle down in, since I have to be in here all day long when I'm working. This is the first time I've had a dedicated space just for art.
The room you work in looks so bright and lovely.
I was attracted to that room right away because the window was so interesting. I thought, "Look at all those neighbors." I remembered watching the movie "Rear Window" and being struck by the scenes of Grace Kelly on a daybed in front of a window, looking out. So I got this daybed.
When I was working on "Sulwe," I did have to put up light-blocking curtains to make sure I was getting all the colors correct. But often I do a lot of emails and busywork during the day and then I get into the drawing late at night, so it ends up working out.
There's not one part of me that wanted to live in a dark little box. The work of an illustrator can be so isolating. To me it feels friendly and happy in here.
You also keep a lot of brushes and pencils around. How often do you use them?
I call that my traditional media corner. I do work with paints and pencils all the time, but I don't think anybody has seen it in my published work. I haven't had the opportunity yet to incorporate it. I do tend to be faster digitally. I'm working on a book now and trying to figure out ways to blend traditional media into my digital work. But I work on stuff all the time that nobody gets to see.
What are those little painted figures?
I picked up peg dolls from the dollar store and painted on them. I was going for something in between Japanese kokeshi dolls and Euro-American peg dolls. I give them as gifts.
How did you choose which children's books to keep on your shelves? Not all of them are picture books.
I do have a lot of middle-grade-ish books. But all of my books that I would really consider my own childhood favorites are still at my parents' house. My Harry Potter books, for example. These books here are ones I picked up recently. I would very much like to do a middle-grade book, to both write and illustrate it, so I'm trying to absorb all the exciting books, the popular ones. I want to do a highly illustrated middle-grade fantasy novel about a child of color.
Your last two books have been collaborations -- "Sulwe" with Lupita Nyong'o and "Hair Love" with Matthew A. Cherry. How did that go after you had so much success with the solo effort of the "Little Leaders" books?
For "Sulwe," I was trying to channel Lupita as a child. She is from the Luo people of Kenya, so I studied their dress and costume. For "Hair Love," I originally designed the characters just for the short film that Matthew Cherry made. Then they signed a deal for the book. For the dad, I was thinking about a gentle giant type, and later on I decided this would be a good opportunity to push against the stereotype and make him younger.
You made the ending of "Hair Love" visually ambiguous -- in the film we surmise that the mom is being treated for cancer, and that's why she's wearing a head wrap, but in the book she could be wearing it for any reason.
I wanted all kids to be able to read it over and over, and not every kid may be ready for that particular story, of a mom with cancer.
What work do you have pinned to the wall?
I've started working with pastels. I bought some really nice ones and it's something I'm exploring. I'm really attracted to how expressionistic and loose you have to be with pastel. As much as you might like to zoom in, you can't. So it's a nice formal way to challenge myself. I love trying to make things look really rendered with the fewest amount of strokes, and trying to make it look the way you would do it on the computer -- but you have to do it with a fat piece of chalk.
It looks like you work at this table a lot.
You know what's ridiculous? I finally have all this space to make art, and I often end up sitting on the floor with all of my stuff spread out, just like I did when I was a kid.
How do you choose what to keep on the table?
I found these vintage field guides to astronomy and plants. If I was to boil down the two things I want to do most, it's capture plants and stars. Then I have different journals for everything. The Indiana Jones movies were another big influence on me. I always wanted to have a grail diary, a little leather journal. Now I have many -- like 15! Some of them are too nice to write in. Some are for specific things. There's one for drawing, one for note-taking, one for notes on a specific story. And some are blank because they feel too precious to make a mistake in.
And not everyone does, but I do need a reference when I draw hands.
You do have one book here that looks like it's from your childhood, "The Book of Goodnight Stories."
I clearly remember this one. It was my older sister's before it came to me. The stories in it are traditional fairy tales, like "The Magic Flute" and "Sleeping Beauty," but some of the illustrations have a more contemporary look. I've been looking at it a lot lately because I realize some of them are done in pastel, and they have a soft, magical quality to them that I really liked as a kid.
I love the green of your sofa.
When I think about the things I love, I think of this one shade of green, maybe almost a hunter green, but with an outdoorsy, springtime feeling, like when the garden is just coming to life. I think a lot about how to make an apartment that I have to be in all the time remind me of the things I like the most.

Texto completo: On Oct. 13, photographer ?? Ngala's exhibit "I larlem Ice: The Selects Folder" opened to great enthusiasm at the Compere Collective Gallery in Brooklyn. Ngala, 24, a lifelong Harlem resident, spent more titan 10 years as a member of Figure Skating in I larlem. Since launching her photography career she has photographed the Harlem community, including the skating sisterhood so formative in her life.
Current FSH skaters and their parents were in attendance at the opening as well as people from different aspects of Ngala's life and career. The exhibition, which was curated by Cierra Britton, features 20 of Ngala's black-and-white images of FSH skaters, much of which she photographed while on the ice with the subjects. The exhibit nins until Oct. 26.
"People were blown away by the work, which was really incredible," said Ngala. "1 strive to create images that are real, speak to people and resonate with them. It was awesome to see everyone feel that."
Over the past couple of years, Ngala's work has received a lot of attention. She has photographed musical artists Cardi B, including an incredible series of images from this year's Met Gala, and Gucci Mane. In January, her FSH images appeared as part of a feature in The New York Times. It gives Ngala great satisfaction to celebrate FSH, which was so instrumental in her life.
"What an amazing combination of the different aspects of my life and things I love the most-photography and figure skating-to culminate in this body of work," she said. "FSH is a beautiful story. For me to be able to bring in my eye and create beautiful images is testament to the power of things f itting together."
The athlete-to-artist transition fascinates Ngala. lliings she learned through FSH-commitment, diligence, focus and expressing emotions through art-play a role in her photography. Being part of a sisterhood and community nurtured her and put her on a great path in life.
"I was literally molded and invested in at a young age to get to a point where I can make a life for myself doing something I love," Ngala said. "In sports you see our bodies are made to be tested and for limits to be broken.. .This work, these girls and their stories.. .show you can go out there and be a Surya Bonaly or Michelle Kwan or you can be a ?? Ngala and make a name for yourself."

Texto completo: Headnote IMMIGRATION KORNER
Seemingly lost in the deluge of impeachment news coverage recently was the less heralded release of some new data from the U.S. Census' American Community Survey. But it is data that we should all take notice of, as it marks the Trumpian impact on the United States in only three years.
The New York Times took note of the significance of the ACS data with a headline on Sept. 26, 2019, that read: "Immigrant Population Growth in the U.S. Slows to a Trickle."
The numbers are shocking in scope since it proves that in just three years, DonaldTrump and his immigration hardliners have managed to deliver a victory for Republicans on something they have been consistently worried about.
Lowering immigration numbers to ensure the browning of America does not threaten their power base and keeps the Democratic voter base from growing.
little wonder that so many in the Grand Ole Party are ready to hold their noses and support Trump, no matter how many rules or laws he breaks.
Just as long as he makes America white again, it's all right-constitution and justice be damned!
Quoting the Tunes' article by Sabrina Tavemise, "The net increase of immigrants in the American population dropped to about 200,000 people in 2018, a decline of more than 70% from the year before, according to William Frey, chief demographer at the Brookings Institution, who conducted the analysis."
Let's repeat that again-a decline of more than 70% from the year before.
That's one year after Trump took office!
Here are some other startling numbers as analyzed by Frey and reported by the Times.
1: "Immigrants as a share of the country's population remained flat at 13.7%, the highest share since 1910."
2: "The largest declines in levels of immigrants were among people from Latin America and Asia."
3: "The last time the pace slowed so much was during the financial crisis in 2008, when the flow actually declined."
4: "Two states-New York and Illinois- had measurable declines in their foreignbom populations."
5: "Of the 14 states with the lowest concentrations of foreign-bom people, 12 voted" for Trump.
David Bier, an immigration expert at the Cato Institute, told the Times "this is something that really hasn't happened since the Great Recession."
Think about for a moment the Great Depression. That's between 19291939, a time when anti-Mexican sentiments were growing and mass removal was being pushed.
In fact, more than 1.2 million Mexican immigrants were forced to leave the United States during the Great Depression. Sometimes, local governments and federal officials would collaborate in "street sweeps" and raids to round up Mexican immigrants who may or may not have been present in the country with proper documentation. Just like with ICE raids today.
In 1931, then U.S. Secretary of Labor William A Doak was quoted as saying: "My conviction is that by strict limitation and a wise selection of immigration, we can make America stronger in every way, hastening the day when our population shall be more homogenous." On Jan. 6, 1931, Doak requested that congress appropriate funds for the deportation of "illegal aliens" from the U.S. The Great Depression only renewed congressional debate about immigration.
Today, 90 years later, its looks like history is sadly repeating itself and the numbers now prove it.

Texto completo: Washington • Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, a son of sharecroppers who rose to become one of the most powerful Democrats in Congress and a central figure in the impeachment investigation of President Donald Trump, died Thursday in Baltimore. He was 68.
His death was confirmed by a spokeswoman, Trudy Perkins, in a statement that said he died of “complications concerning long-standing health challenges.” No other details were given.
As chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, Cummings had sweeping power to investigate Trump and his administration — and he used it.
A critical ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Cummings spent his final months in Congress sparring with the president, calling Trump’s effort to block congressional lines of inquiry “far worse than Watergate.”
He was sued by Trump as the president tried to keep his business records secret.
With his booming voice and a speaking cadence with hints of the pulpit — his parents eventually became preachers — Cummings was a compelling figure on Capitol Hill. For more than two decades, he represented a section of Baltimore with more than its share of social problems. He campaigned tirelessly for stricter gun control laws and help for those addicted to drugs.
He grabbed the national spotlight in 2015 when he took to the streets of Baltimore, bullhorn in hand, and pleaded for calm after riots erupted in his neighborhood after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a young black man who died in police custody. Hours earlier, Cummings had delivered Gray’s eulogy.

When the president assailed Cummings’s beloved Baltimore — a city whose population is two-thirds African American — as “a disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess” and “the worst run and most dangerous” city in the United States, the congressman vociferously defended his hometown. He said while it was his “constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch,” it was his “moral duty” to fight for his constituents.
Cummings took on both tasks with passion. He used his powerful perch on Capitol Hill to target Trump in the most public of ways. In February of this year, Cummings summoned Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer, to testify before his committee for an extraordinary hearing in which Cohen denounced the president as “a con man” and a “cheat.”
The most arresting moment came from the congressman’s plaintive closing statement. “We have got to get back to normal!” Cummings thundered from the dais, in a moment that quickly went viral.
Cummings was in his 13th term serving as a representative for Maryland. He had been absent from Capitol Hill in recent weeks because of his illness. But before that, he could often be found in the Speaker’s Lobby — the ornate antechamber off the House floor, decorated with portraits of past House speakers — fielding reporter’s questions or quietly reading in the motorized wheelchair he used.
As Washington awoke to news of Cummings’ passing Thursday, lawmakers publicly mourned the loss of a congressman they called a lion of the institution and a treasured representative of his constituents.
“He spoke truth to power, defended the disenfranchised and represented West Baltimore with strength and dignity,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, chairman of the Democratic caucus, wrote on Twitter. “Congress has lost a Champion. Heaven has gained an Angel of Justice. May he forever #RestInPower.”
Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md., who served with Cummings in the House, said his death left an “irreplaceable void.”
“Quite possibly no elected official mattered so much to his constituents,” Cardin said in a statement. “Chairman Cummings guaranteed a voice to so many who would otherwise not have one and stood as a symbol for the heights one could reach if they paid no mind to obstacles, naysayers and hate.”
Cummings prided himself on his slow, methodical manner, but he could also work himself into a fiery oration, when his brow would furrow deeply and his voice would quiver with emotion. When Trump sued him in April to keep his business records secret, Cummings urged Congress to move slowly on impeachment. But the following month, with the White House raising a full-scale blockade of Democrats’ access to documents and witnesses, Cummings sounded impatient in an interview.
“It sounds like he’s asking us to impeach him,” the congressman said then, calling the White House blockade “a constitutional crisis” that was “far worse than Watergate.”
Cummings was also an ardent defender of Hillary Clinton as the top Democrat during the grueling hearings held by the committee that investigated the 2012 terrorist attack on two government facilities in Benghazi, Libya. His antagonistic exchanges with the chairman of that panel, former Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., once grew so heated that The Daily Beast proclaimed the two men had gone “ballistic.”
Cummings had a series of health challenges in recent years and had begun making his way around the Capitol in his motorized scooter and using a walker to steady himself. In 2017, he was in the hospital for two months after complications from a heart valve replacement, convinced, he said, that he was “living on borrowed time.”
But he was spiritual in his approach to his illness, and his life. He told the story of how one day, when was in such dire pain that he thought he might faint, a hospital worker turned up at his bedside, saying the Lord had sent her to deliver a message: “I’m just trying to get your attention. I’m not done with you.”
As his health deteriorated, Cummings’ wife, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, ended her bid for governor. In a statement Thursday, she called her late husband “a dynamic figure in American politics.”
“He worked until his last breath because he believed our democracy was the highest and best expression of our collective humanity and that our nation’s diversity was our promise, not our problem,” said Maya Cummings, who chairs the Maryland Democratic Party.
Although he was a fierce defender of his party and its interests, Elijah Cummings had strong friendships with members of the other party. Republicans generally held him in high regard, and he had an especially improbable bond with Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., a leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus.
“Just hearing about the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings and my heart is broken,” former Rep. Mia Love, R-Utah, wrote on Twitter. “Just broken. I had the honor and privilege of serving with this strong man in Congress.”
Cummings was revered in Baltimore, where he came up as a lawyer and later a state legislator. A tall, broad-shouldered man with an expressive face, Cummings had served in Congress since winning a special election in 1996 to fill the seat vacated by Kweisi Mfume, who resigned to become president of the NAACP. Cummings’ 7th District includes most of West Baltimore and suburbs west of the city, as well as Howard County.
Since his initial victory in 1996, Cummings had not been seriously challenged in either a primary or general election, according to The Almanac of American Politics. In 2003 and 2004, he was chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was an early supporter of Barack Obama for president and was co-chairman of Obama’s campaign in Maryland in 2008.
Elijah Eugene Cummings, the son of sharecroppers from South Carolina who moved north to improve prospects for themselves and their children, who would eventually number seven, was born in Baltimore on Jan. 18, 1951, and grew up in the city.
He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Howard University in Washington, where he was student government president, with a degree in political science. He earned a law degree from the University of Maryland and was a practicing attorney while serving for 14 years in the Maryland House of Delegates, where he was the first African American in the state’s history to be named speaker pro tem.

Texto completo: Google and other Big Tech companies are rushing headlong to establish a new protocol, called DNS over HTTPS ("DoH"), that internet safety experts fear could open the floodgates to child pornography, drugs, malware and other illegal activity on the internet and enable perpetrators to hide behind new privacy shields.
As a veteran child safety and cybercrimes police detective, now retired after 30 years, I have dedicated my career to helping children by pursuing, apprehending and prosecuting child predators. I am urging Google and the other proponents of this plan to slow down, think this through carefully and respond to questions from law enforcement and federal authorities about the dangers of this plan.
Parents, already struggling to keep up with the ever-changing online world, do not need dangerous new gateways through which their daughters and sons can be exposed to predators, pornography, cyberbullies, school violence and drug dealers.
Already, as a recent New York Times investigation found, tech companies have reported 45 million online photos and videos of children being sexually abused this year -— more than double what they found the previous year. And the number keeps growing. Now is not the time to make it even easier to spread this filth and hide behind Google’s shield.
Child-safety experts at the internet Watch Foundation (IWF) are warning that the so-called privacy changes could have a "catastrophic impact" by exposing child victims to some of the worst practices on the internet.
As the IWF notes, Google’s plan would mean that criminals could soon have countless new ways to bypass safeguards that child safety groups, cybersecurity experts, internet service providers and government agencies have developed. These changes could allow child predators to directly interact with children and then disappear, leaving law enforcement no means to find the offenders.
Antitrust investigators with the House Judiciary Committee have also sent a letter to Google asking the company to address serious concerns about the plan.
Specifically, the plan causing so much concern involves the internet Domain Name System (DNS), which makes the web work by connecting websites to unique addresses on the internet. Thanks to the DNS, which is often called "the phone book of the internet," a user can type in a website name and end up exactly where they want to go.
But the change could hide user requests, strengthen encryption, enable criminals to bypass essential filters like parental controls, and make abusive material freely accessible. This would come at the same time that online child-abuse groups are sharing images of ever younger children and more extreme forms of abuse. The groups use encrypted technologies to teach pedophiles how to carry out the crimes and how to record and share images of the abuse worldwide. We cannot afford to give them new tools for hiding out.
I have the following three specific questions that need to be addressed: How will law enforcement be able to track online predators who collaborate through private email services and meet at a website to sexually exploit our children?
Will law enforcement still be able to track domestic terrorists such as school shooters who collaborate on certain websites they visit to obtain their information?
With millions of schools using Google Chromebooks instead of printed books, will this new protocol enable bypassing school filters such as Go Guardian and Securely that help keep our children safe while using a school device?
In the pursuit of greater privacy, we must not jeopardize safety. We must fully evaluate the dangerous impact these changes could introduce. We must ensure that tech companies are implementing well-informed, responsible updates that strengthen, not diminish our children’s interaction with the online world.
Detective Richard Wistocki (Ret.) was a law enforcement officer for 30 years, including over two decades as an internet Crimes Investigator with the Naperville Police Department. As a cybercrimes detective and child safety proponent, he educates law enforcement, parents and students on responsible digital activity.

Friends for over a decade with a shared interest in spirituality and philosophy, Josh Radnor and Ben Lee had always said they should write a song together. One song turned into ten, and Radnor & Lee was born. After their first live show, a friend described their music as "the intersection of pop and prayer." Upon hearing this, their producer Ryan Dilmore dubbed them "singer-psalmwriters." The duo's 2017 self-titled debut album features 11 songs that are in turn witty, hopeful, yearning, joyful, searching, and meditative.
American actor, filmmaker, and musician Josh Radnor is best known for portraying Ted Mosby on the popular Emmy Award-winning CBS sitcom "How I Met Your Mother." He made his writing and directorial debut in 2010 with the comedy/drama Happythankyoumoreplease, winning the Sundance Film Festival Audience Award and being nominated for the Grand Jury Prize.

Texto completo: On Tuesday night, Joe Biden addressed his son's role with a Ukrainian company while he was vice president, saying, "My son made a judgment; I'm proud of the judgment he made."
Tuesday night marked the first presidential debate following the U.S. House of Representative's impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump.
Biden, like other Democratic presidential candidates, has called for the impeachment of the president in the recent weeks.
The debate in Westerville, Ohio, featured 12 candidates on one stage — the biggest presidential primary debate ever. The first question of the night focused on impeachment, where each candidate spelled out why they believed the president should be impeached.
The second question focused on Biden's son, Hunter, and whether it was right for him to be involved with a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was vice president.
"My son did nothing wrong," Biden said. "I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine."
In an interview with ABC News, Hunter Biden said that his involvement with a Ukraine company while his father was vice president was "poor judgment" but firmly maintained that he did nothing wrong.
Hunter Biden told ABC News that he never spoke to his father about his business dealings when his dad was vice president.
In 2014, Hunter Biden joined the board of Burisma. During his tenure, Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin investigated the company.
The New York Times reported in May that Joe Biden, while in office in 2016, threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees unless Ukraine reduced its corruption. Part of that demand called for removing Shokin, the country's top prosecutor, who was investigating the oligarch behind an energy company where Hunter Biden served on the board.
Shokin was accused by U.S. officials of ignoring corruption in his own office. The Ukrainian Parliament eventually voted him out. The country's current prosecutor maintains that there is no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter.
None of the candidates during the three-hour debate criticized Biden or his son on this issue. Sen. Cory Booker — who has sharply criticized Biden at previous debates — came to Biden's defense, saying it was "offensive" for candidates to address this issue.
Biden, the New Jersey senator said, is a "statesman."
The former vice president did not directly answer the question about whether it was proper for Hunter to be involved with Burisma. Biden focused on how he believes the president does not want to face him in a general election in 2020.
"The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption," Biden said. "That's what we should be focusing on."

Reporting Stronger Sales, Huawei Seems to Tolerate Taint of Trump's Blacklist

Texto completo: A recovery in quarterly revenue suggests that the Chinese tech giant is weathering the Trump administration's efforts to hobble it.
BEIJING -- Huawei said on Wednesday that its sales growth recovered in the most recent quarter, suggesting that the Chinese technology giant has been successfully weathering the Trump administration's efforts to stymie its business around the world.
The United States added Huawei to an export blacklist in May, restricting its access to many of the American-origin parts it needs to make its smartphones and telecom gear and causing the company's revenue growth to take a hit. But sales from January to September were $ 86 billion, an increase of nearly 25 percent from a year earlier, Huawei said. That implies, based on comparisons with previously released figures, that sales accelerated in the July-to-September quarter.
Huawei is the world's leading producer of the equipment that powers cellphone networks. But American officials have long been concerned that the Chinese government could use the company's products to gather intelligence, an accusation that Huawei has repeatedly denied.
Washington's warnings have so far failed to halt Huawei's drive to remain a powerhouse supplier as telecom carriers around the world upgrade their networks to the next generation of wireless technology, or 5G. The company said on Wednesday that it had signed more than 60 5G contracts worldwide, up from 50 a few months ago.
Huawei's shares are not publicly traded, which means it has no legal obligation to announce its financials. The company began reporting quarterly results only this year, and the figures it provides are not audited. It can also be selective about which numbers it shares.
On Wednesday, for instance, the company did not offer a breakdown of its latest sales for different business divisions, which would have provided a better sense of how it has been dealing with the American blacklisting.
The blacklist has not yet amounted to an airtight ban on American technology sales to Huawei. For the past few months, the Trump administration has permitted sales to Huawei that are used to maintain existing mobile networks. And some of the company's American suppliers have determined that they can lawfully continue selling to Huawei certain nonsensitive products that are made outside the United States.
The administration is preparing to issue export licenses to some American companies soon, which could help ease the strain on Huawei's supply chain. In a conference call with analysts last month, the chief executive of the American chip maker Micron, Sanjay Mehrotra, said that if the company was unable to get licenses, its sales to Huawei could start to tumble.
Huawei may be feeling the absence of one American partner more acutely. Because the company is barred from working with Google, the latest Huawei flagship smartphone, the Mate 30 series, has been released without Google's Play Store and therefore without normal access to Google apps.
That makes no difference for Huawei's many fans in China, where most Google services are blocked anyway. But it could seriously turn off phone buyers across Europe and the rest of the world, for whom a phone without the Google Maps, Gmail and YouTube apps may as well be a shiny brick.
Huawei says it has built its own smartphone operating system, Harmony, although it remains to be seen whether the company can persuade enough developers to build software and services for Harmony that could substitute for Google's. Huawei said on Wednesday that it shipped more than 185 million smartphones between January and September, an increase of 26 percent from the same period last year.
Huawei did not break out the latest quarter's results on their own. But comparing the nine-month figures with the company's previously disclosed six-month figures suggests that sales growth for the most recent quarter was 27 percent, up from 13 percent in the quarter before. Huawei also said its profit margin for the first nine months of the year was 8.7 percent, which is the same profit figure it gave for the first half of this year.

Prolific TV Producer Signs a Podcast Deal

Texto completo: Shonda Rhimes, the prolific television producer whose body of work includes the durable ABC drama "Grey's Anatomy," moved into the streaming world in 2017 when she signed a nine-figure deal to create shows for Netflix. Now, she is taking her talent for storytelling to the audio realm as the executive producer of new podcasts to be made in conjunction with the broadcast giant iHeartMedia.
Ms. Rhimes's production company, Shondaland, and iHeart announced the partnership, a three-year deal, on Wednesday. Under the arrangement, Ms. Rhimes will produce more than a dozen iHeartRadio original podcasts that will be available on the iHeartPodcast Network. With the deal, Shondaland has also started a new division, Shondaland Audio.
In addition to "Grey's Anatomy," a network stalwart since 2005, Ms. Rhimes and Shondaland were behind ABC's "Scandal" and "How to Get Away With Murder." For Netflix, Ms. Rhimes has said she plans to make at least eight new shows.
The first to go into production, "Bridgerton," a high-society soap set in Regency-era London, is based on a popular series of romance novels by Julia Quinn. With a cast that includes Julie Andrews and Regé-Jean Page, it is scheduled to start streaming on Netflix next year.
Ms. Rhimes is no podcasting rookie. In 2018, Shondaland created "Katie's Crib," a weekly podcast on motherhood, hosted by the "Scandal" actress Katie Lowes. That show will migrate to iHeartPodcast under the new deal, which will include a show about a first lady and another featuring the comedian Ali Wentworth.
Shondaland is "just beginning our digital journey," Ms. Rhimes said in an email. Of the podcasting venture with iHeart, she said that "if the opportunity presents itself for some crossover with our friends at Netflix, we would certainly explore it."
Nearly a third of Americans ages 12 and up -- about 90 million people -- listen to podcasts at least once a month, up from 21 percent three years ago, according to a survey this year by Edison Research.
The 67 shows on NPR, the top podcast studio, were downloaded more than 151 million times last month, according to a ranking from the podcast measurement firm Podtrac. Ranked second was iHeartRadio, with 268 shows downloaded 147 million times. "The Daily," from The New York Times, is the most popular single podcast.
Commercial time on popular podcasts can fill up months in advance, advertisers have reported. A report this summer from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC estimated that advertising revenue hit $ 479.1 million last year.
Conal Byrne, the president of iHeartPodcast Network, said in an email that he expected Shondaland Audio to be especially appealing to "an engaged, smart female audience" as well as "top-tier, big, established brands" interested in advertising their wares.
Shondaland podcasts will have four commercials on average, he said -- one at the beginning of each episode, two in the middle, and one at the end, each 30 to 60 seconds long.
The intimacy of podcasting is attractive to some advertisers. But as the medium has evolved, the trope of a host riffing on ad copy is no longer the only option. Ads for Shondaland Audio will use a process called dynamic insertion, which allows publishers to go with ads that target specific groups of listeners.
Platforms like Spotify, which once positioned itself exclusively as a music outlet, have crowded into podcasting. Spotify said this year that it had paid about $ 400 million for the podcast companies Gimlet Media, Anchor and Parcast.
The data on who is listening to a given show is murky, however, and podcasting platforms do not provide "sophisticated targeting tools on par with what Facebook and other digital platforms offer advertisers," according to an analysis by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
On Wednesday, advertisers and media buyers gathered at the Manhattan office of the publishing company Meredith to preview programming and discuss sponsorship deals with podcasts from Slate, WNYC, Wondery and others.
Ira Glass, the host of the radio show and podcast "This American Life," went onstage to promote an upcoming Serial Productions show about racial integration in a Brooklyn school.
"There's just an intimacy to this medium," he said at the sold-out event, which was organized by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. "That kind of bond really carries over to the advertisers."
WarnerMedia said at the event that it would release several new podcasts in the coming months, including one about the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein featuring the CNN reporter Vicky Ward. This summer, Ms. Ward said her reporting on accusations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Epstein had been blocked from publication in Vanity Fair.
For years, iHeartMedia, which operates about 850 terrestrial radio stations in the United States, largely sat out the podcast revolution. Last year, it paid $ 55 million for Stuff Media, the producer of hit podcasts like "Stuff You Should Know." The company has also announced plans to translate shows like "Stuff You Should Know" into Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, French and German, and to go into business with Blumhouse, the Hollywood studio behind horror films like "The Purge" and "Get Out."
Now, iHeart offers technology that allows podcast advertisers to "reach exactly who they want, at scale," said Mr. Byrne, the president of the company's podcasting division.

Texto completo: Holding internet platforms liable for certain content would harm internet users.
Who benefits from Section 230, the federal law that shields online platforms from liability for content posted by users? According to commentators and politicians, Section 230 helps only large tech companies. But the biggest beneficiaries of Section 230 are internet users, not internet companies. Before Congress undermines Section 230, it must understand how users rely on it -- and how the internet would change without it.
Section 230 -- originally enacted by the Communications Decency Act and also referred to as C.D.A. 230 -- says that internet platforms will not be held liable in court for things that their users say online. It has some exceptions -- notably, it does nothing to shield platforms from liability under federal criminal law -- but at its core, the law is a simple, common-sense policy: If I go online and post something illegal, I should be the one held responsible, not the message board where I posted it.
Without Section 230, the internet would be a more confined place, one with fewer spaces where we can all gather, socialize and share ideas. Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit wouldn't exist -- at least in their current form -- and neither would knowledge-sharing sites like Wikipedia, the Internet Archive and Stack Exchange. If these companies were held liable for everything their users posted, the risk of litigation would make running them extremely dangerous.
If lawmakers weakened Section 230, they wouldn't just be threatening those spaces -- they would risk kicking some people completely off the internet. Without Section 230, platforms would effectively have to determine the risk of a user before that user would ever be allowed to speak. History shows that when platforms clamp down on their users' speech, the people most excluded are the ones most excluded from other aspects of public life, too. Facebook's "real names" policy kicked a Native American, Shane Creepingbear (his real name), off the platform. Under their policies on violence, both Twitter and YouTube suspended the accounts of Egyptian journalist Wael Abbas, who'd used the platforms to report on police brutality. Again and again, marginalized communities bear the brunt of heavy-handed censorship by platforms.
While Section 230 has gotten more attention this year than ever before, it's been stubbornly mischaracterized as a handout to tech companies. Representative Nancy Pelosi recently called the law a "gift" to Big Tech, implying that Congress should gut the law in order to fight the increasing dominance of the five largest tech companies. Others have attempted to tie Section 230 to the spread of hate speech online, though the connection between the two is flimsy at best: Since hate speech is not a defined crime in the United States, Section 230 has no bearing on whether websites are allowed to host it.
Conservatives have their own arguments for getting rid of Section 230, insisting that large social media companies systematically censor conservative voices and should have their Section 230 immunity revoked as punishment. But the evidence suggests that scrapping Section 230 would cement those companies' market status.
Google, Facebook and Twitter are likely to survive any change to Section 230 that Congress passes. Those companies have the staff to review users' posts at scale and the legal resources necessary to comply with future changes to Section 230. Facebook has bragged to Congress about the amount of illegal material it removes before anyone sees it, a standard very few other companies could meet. Future legislation to erode Section 230 might do nothing more than further harden Facebook and Google from meaningful competition.
Congress already began to undermine Section 230 last year in the form of the so-called Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, or Fosta. The only change to Section 230 in its 23-year history, Fosta holds a website responsible if it "assists, supports, or facilitates" sex trafficking. The law's broad wording has forced web platforms to become more restrictive than ever in what types of posts they allow.
Fosta was opposed by sex trafficking experts, sex worker advocates, civil liberties activists and many others who believed that it would put sex workers' lives in danger. They argued that sex workers would have to transition to dangerous street-based work, and that harm-reduction resources that sex workers rely on would go offline. Both predictions have come true.
Who supported Fosta? Big Tech. And here's a hint as to why: Right after Fosta passed, multiple dating sites shut down, including Craigslist's dating section and a niche site for furries called Pounced. Their decision was understandable: These small companies don't have anything like the resources of Facebook or Google, and one claim under Fosta could have cost millions of dollars. A few weeks later, Facebook announced that it was entering the online dating industry.
In other words, Big Tech lobbied for a bill that would make it harder for new entrants to compete with it, and when that bill passed, it immediately set about growing into the gaps vacated by its would-be competitors. That's the real story of Big Tech and Fosta.
Since Fosta became law, a narrative has developed that tech companies started praising the bill only when its passage had become inevitable. In fact, the Internet Association -- the lobbying association representing Google, Facebook, Twitter and dozens of other major internet companies -- endorsed an early Senate version of the bill in November 2017, months before the text was finalized.
Today, both Republicans and Democrats seem determined to use Section 230 to punish Big Tech. In response, the companies have made nominal noise in defense of the law -- the Internet Association recently held an event on Capitol Hill with ice cream and puppies -- but they're not scared. They know that no matter what Congress does to Section 230, they will survive and many of their competitors won't. They know that changes to the law will sink their smaller competitors, and that those competitors are their future acquisitions.
Instead of undermining Section 230, we should pass comprehensive privacy legislation letting users control how their data is collected, used and shared.
We should address Big Tech's unfair business models -- in which users have no control over their data and can't easily move to a competitor -- head-on. We should modernize antitrust law and stop the endless flood of mergers and acquisitions that have made competition among internet services an illusion. And we should demand a private right of action that can't be signed away in a terms-of-service agreement: When the privacy rights of users are violated, users should be allowed to sue those companies rather than waiting around for a government agency to do something.
The big companies will panic and offer to endorse further changes to Section 230 instead. Don't let them get away with it.

Texto completo: In the past three months, Mr. Biden spent more on his campaign than he raised. He begins an aggressive phase of the primary race with far less cash on hand than top rivals.
WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign began October with less than $ 9 million in the bank as the 2020 Democratic primary race entered a new and more aggressive phase, barely more than a third as much cash as that of his leading rival, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and nearly $ 25 million behind the race's money leader, Senator Bernie Sanders.
In the past three months, Mr. Biden spent more money than he raised, $ 17.7 million compared with $ 15.7 million, a sign of his operation's fiscal peril so many months before the first votes will be cast in February.
On the Republican side, President Trump continued to pad his coffers for the general election, announcing that his campaign, the Republican National Committee and their shared accounts had a staggering $ 158 million cash on hand.
The new disclosures came only moments after Mr. Biden stepped off a debate stage where the dynamics made plain that even his rivals no longer saw him as the front-runner. They are the latest sign that Mr. Biden, who relies mainly on large donors, is struggling to compete with the small-donor-funded campaigns of Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., who entered October with two and half times as much cash as Mr. Biden.
"It'll be a telling moment for Biden," said Jennifer Palmieri, who served as communications director for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. "His supporters will see he does not have enough money, and either that will prompt a bunch of money to come in in the fourth quarter, or he's going to be in very rough shape."
"Because you can't run a serious primary campaign on $ 9 million," she added.
Democratic candidates were required to report their fund-raising for the third quarter, which went from July through September, to the Federal Election Commission by Tuesday. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, led the Democratic field with $ 33.7 million cash on hand to begin October, while Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, had $ 25.7 million, and Mr. Buttigieg had $ 23.4 million.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Biden noted that he had been in the race for less time than his rivals -- he entered in April -- and that he had not begun by "dropping $ 10 million from a Senate campaign, wherever that money was raised from."
He did not name Ms. Warren, though his allies have criticized her for boasting of her refusal to hold fund-raisers after beginning the race with $ 10 million from her Senate coffers, which had been raised while she held such events.
With just under $ 9 million, Mr. Biden is far closer to the cash total of the political newcomer Andrew Yang, who had $ 6.4 million in the bank to begin October, than to those at the top of the fund-raising leader board.
"Oh my," Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager in 2008, remarked when the figures were first posted on Twitter.
Mr. Biden's treasury now ranks fifth in the Democratic field, also behind Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had $ 10.5 million in the bank, though her $ 911,000 in unpaid bills -- to her pollster, media buyer and lawyers, among others -- meant that her functional cash on hand was closer to $ 9.6 million. (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg reported no debts.)
The self-funding billionaire Tom Steyer, who entered the race in July and reported spending $ 47 million, also has more financial resources than Mr. Biden heading toward the Iowa caucuses, which are less than four months away.
Mr. Biden's team has steadfastly said that it has enough cash to run the campaign it wants, and recently announced plans to spent $ 6 million on digital and television ads in the coming months.
"The fundamental question about fund-raising is: Do you have what you need to run your race? And we do," said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden.
On Friday, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, scheduled a conference call with the campaign's donors, presumably to reassure them about the path forward. Top fund-raisers for Mr. Biden recently gathered in Philadelphia for a full day of briefings on Mr. Biden's strategy through Super Tuesday in early March.
But with Mr. Biden relatively low on funds and now trailing Ms. Warren in some polls in both of the first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign faces the possibility of a serious pinch on his resources, long before the campaign expands to bigger states like California and Texas.
Tad Devine, a veteran Democratic strategist who advised Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign but is not working for anyone in the 2020 race, said the lack of cash would limit Mr. Biden's political options. He pointed to the variety of areas where campaigns might want to invest money: airing television ads, deploying staff on the ground, staging splashy but expensive events and running a robust digital program.
"Your strategic options are limited," Mr. Devine said, adding that the options available to Mr. Biden's better-funded rivals were "much bigger."
"He's going to have to place the right bet," Mr. Devine said. "It's going to have to be a winner. It's almost like you're playing roulette, and one guy gets five numbers and the other guy gets one number. Who's going to win?"
Over the summer, Mr. Biden had already begun to slash his digital spending budget, which was also clear in the new fillings. He spent about $ 1 million in the first half of the quarter and about $ 311,000 in the second half, records show.
During the quarter, Mr. Biden also spent $ 924,000 on a charter jet company, Advanced Aviation Team, as he raced across the country not only for rallies and speeches but also for dozens of fund-raisers on both coasts. Mr. Biden's campaign said the costs included paying for carbon offsets.
Mr. Biden's biggest expense is his payroll, which cost about $ 6.8 million in the past three months, records show. Mr. Biden had roughly 440 people on his payroll -- about as many as Mr. Buttigieg -- while Ms. Warren had more than 600 and Mr. Sanders had about 550.
In addition to his staff, Mr. Biden also paid more than $ 250,000 to various fund-raising consultants and nearly $ 500,000 in rent to cover both his downtown Philadelphia headquarters and outposts in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
While Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have rejected traditional fund-raising from large donors, Mr. Biden spent much of September traveling the country to collect $ 1,000 and $ 2,800 checks. More than two-thirds of his fund-raising, about $ 10.8 million, came from donors giving more than $ 200; less than $ 5 million came from those who gave less than that.
Mr. Biden was hardly the only candidate to spend more than he raised last quarter. Over half of the candidates, including Ms. Harris, did so, with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota reporting the highest so-called burn rate, spending $ 1.62 for every dollar raised.
Several campaigns reported less than $ 1 million in the bank, though only one candidate who appeared at Tuesday's debate was in such a dire financial position: Julián Castro, the former housing secretary, had less than $ 700,000 left.

Five things that would have raised the debate

Texto completo: Can a televised debate in 2019 really serve the public interest?
Given the state of American media and politics, it seems like a long shot. We're just too addicted to horse-race politics, reality-TV values and social-media snark for something as earnest as that.
But Tuesday night's debate in Ohio had potential. The candidate field had been winnowed, and among the moderators was New York Times National Editor Marc Lacey, who brought an ink-stained seriousness to the table that also included two respectable CNN hosts: Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett.
In fact, it wasn't awful. As with the previous three debates, patient and dedicated viewers had a chance to learn a lot about the candidates - and to see, once again, the striking diversity of a field that includes multiple women and people of color and a gay man.
But it could have been so much better. Here's my Wednesday-morning quarterbacking of what would have helped both in the debate planning and execution.
1. Including questions about climate change and voting rights. Granted, the time was limited (though hardly short), but these are two of the most crucial issues of our time. And they are sorely underexplored on the debate stage in this political season. Did the rehashing of Medicare-for-all and gun control really need - again - to take up so much time at the expense of so much that needs to be fully aired? Binyamin Appelbaum, a Times editorial writer, expressed the exasperation of many: "No questions about climate change. Zero. Zip. Nada." The absence was appalling.
2. Framing the (apparently unavoidable) question about universal health care and how to fund it in a non-gotcha way. Journalists are kindly doing President Trump's work for him when they insist on trying to pin down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the new front-runner, to declare she'd raise taxes to fund Medicare-for-all. Of course, it's legitimate to dig into the costs, but not in a way that creates a nice GOP campaign ad, and misses the larger lens of overall costs. (Warren, notably, refused to take the bait.)
3. Having fewer candidates onstage. It was a relief to have the field tightened from the last round - as my 20-something daughter drolly acknowledged when she asked me, mid-debate, if I was missing John Hickenlooper. (No, I did not pine for the former Colorado governor, nor former Maryland congressman John Delaney, and couldn't shed a tear for Ohio congressman Tim Ryan, either.)
Still: 12? At one debate? That never had a chance of being workable, and it wasn't. One third fewer (just like the calories in light food) would have brought it down to a far more manageable eight, and this viewer could have done without - for example - hearing Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard repeat "regime change war" a dozen times during the foreign-policy discussion.
Having businessman Andrew Yang onstage, however, was delightful if only because of his MATH (Make America Think Harder) lapel pin. Billionaire Tom Steyer? Please.
4. Making it a tight two hours instead of a mind-numbing three. "This debate is so long that it contained an entire vaccine news cycle," quipped BuzzFeed News Editor in Chief Ben Smith sometime in the final hour, tweeting a news story about the publicity around - and cancellation of - a Harlem event hosted by the Rev. Al Sharpton's civil rights organization that would have given credence to anti-vaccine viewpoints.
5. Eliminating the cringe-inducing last question. It was good, this time, not to have dull opening statements and closing statements. But the substitution, in the final minutes, of "tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us" was flat-out embarrassing.
A couple of candidates expounded on the late Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), well-known for reaching across the aisle - thus making the revelations something less than surprising. Others talked about someone they met on the campaign trail, which hardly seemed to amount to a friendship.
It didn't help that the question was inspired by the recently hyped, thoroughly self-serving celebrity pseudo-friendship between comedian Ellen DeGeneres and former president George W. Bush.
Perhaps recognizing the hollowness at the heart of the question, many used their last-gasp moments more cannily: to remind viewers how to find their campaign websites.
On balance, the debate was reasonably substantive and useful. I'd even call it a public service, if a flawed one.
Luckily - if that's the right word - there are eight more chances to get it right.

Texto completo: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was exposed in Tuesday night’s debate as the petty, patronizing, petulant poseur she really is. Pundit after pundit is declaring her a debate loser, and they are right. Yet, she may still be the leader of the Democratic field, for want of a stronger alternative.
Here, then, is an annotated list of Warren’s three worst moments.
1. Political insiders love to focus on policy weaknesses or verbal gaffes, but the deadliest mistake a candidate can make is to appear unlikable. Warren, in extremely petty fashion, did exactly that — it sounded like the audience even hissed at her — when Joe Biden claimed credit for lobbying for votes to help pass one of Warren’s signature bills.
First, Warren boasted about her bill to create the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Biden jumped in with both his own claim of credit and a generous compliment.
“I agreed with the great job she did,” he said, and then turning to her, continued, “and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight, too.”
Rather than thank him for his help, though, Warren pointedly refused to credit him at all: “I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law ….”
Biden interjected another compliment: “You did a hell of a job in your job.”
Again, Warren refused to acknowledge Biden’s involvement, instead rather prissily thanking him not for his help but for the compliment.
It was a bad look.
2. Warren’s repeated failure to answer direct questions about whether her “Medicare for all” plan would require a tax increase on middle-class households made her look dishonest.
She was first asked, very explicitly, “Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?” Rather than say yes or no, she babbled on about total “costs,” apparently trying to hide the certain tax increase under a possible, hoped-for, and in fact, quite debatable reduction in healthcare costs. Asked a second time, again directly, she again evaded the question: “So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face.”
South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg immediately lowered the boom: “Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything — except this.”
Amazingly, when given a third opportunity to come clean and just say she wants to raise taxes on the middle class, she ducked for a third time. “Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?”
Answer: “So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families ….”
She looked as weaselly as a politician can look. Then as if things couldn’t get any worse, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar knocked her down again: “At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.”
3. Warren asserted quite ludicrously that “bad trade policy,” not automation, is the biggest factor in industrial job losses today. This has been ably debunked over the years, and it's just as factually incorrect when it's coming out of President Trump's mouth. But, worse for Warren, Andrew Yang seized upon this error and invoked the human factor to make her look foolish:
“Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks. What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.”
In one quick answer, Yang made Warren look like the ivory-tower elitist, removed from everyday lives, that she really is.
She deserves to take a political tumble from which no machine can lift her back up.

Texto completo: It is impossible to take the 2020 Democratic primary debates seriously when the moderators themselves treat them like parlor games. These are not serious events and they do not deserve serious attention.
CNN’s Anderson Cooper, for example, finished Tuesday’s Democratic debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, with this question:Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, ‘We are all different and I think that we’ve forgotten that that’s OK, that we’re all different.’ So, in that spirit, we’d like you to tell us about a friendship that you’ve had that would surprise us and what impact it has had on you and your beliefs. It is astonishing that Cooper found time during the three-hour debate to ask the 2020 candidates about Ellen but that neither he nor CNN’s Erin Burnett nor New York Times national editor Marc Lacey found time to ask a question about China’s communist regime and its evident domination of corporate America.
The Ellen question wasn't even topical by the time it was asked. That story happened two weeks ago!
The Los Angeles Lakers’ LeBron James, on the other hand, reminded the world Monday evening just how beholden the NBA is to its Chinese corporate masters. James was asked specifically about the league siding with communist China against Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, who said in a since-deleted tweet, “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”
This is what James had to say when he was asked if Morey should be disciplined for supporting pro-democracy demonstrators:We all do have freedom of speech, but at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you’re not thinking about others and you’re only thinking about yourself. I don’t want to get into a word- or sentence-feud with Daryl Morey, but I believe he wasn’t educated on the situation at hand, and he spoke. So many people could have been harmed, not only financially but physically, emotionally, spiritually. So just be careful what we tweet and we say and what we do even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that, too.James’ remarks are not a one-off for the NBA. This is a league-wide capitulation. The NBA, which bills itself as the most progressive and outspoken of the major U.S. sports, is caving as a whole to the censorious demands of a brutal and literally murderous regime. The cowardice extends from the league commissioner all the way down to even apolitical players like the Houston Rockets’ James Harden, who apologized to China, saying "We apologize. You know, we love China. We love playing there. They show us the most important love.” They are all bending a knee in obedience to the communists.
Worse even than the NBA's public kowtowing to China is that this is apparently relatively standard behavior for an American corporation with business interests in China. It seems like all American businesses with a financial stake in China are rolling over these days, supporting the official communist party line.
Apple removed the Taiwan flag emoji from iOS in Hong Kong. Apple also removed an app that allowed the pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters to track police movement, claiming the program “endanger[ed] law enforcement and residents.” Nike stripped its stores in China of Houston Rockets merchandise after Morey’s tweet. Delta Airlines once apologized for describing Taiwan and Tibet as countries. Marriott International recently fired an American employee for “liking” a pro-Tibet tweet. (China's seven-decadeslong occupation of Tibet is yet another sore point for the regime, after Taiwan, flagrant human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and the violation of treaty obligations in Hong Kong.)
The list goes on. China’s iron grip on American businesses and interests is a grave issue that all would-be presidents should be asked to address, especially with the resurgence of populism in the United States. If you don’t think trade with China will become a major issue with the American electorate the more it discovers just how beholden U.S. companies are to their communist masters, you have got another think coming.
Yet the 2020 Democratic primary candidates were not asked about this issue Tuesday evening. They were asked instead about a two-week-old story involving Ellen’s notion of friendship.
Because these debates are largely unserious affairs, moderated by largely unserious people.

'She is indeed the front-runner': Warren knocks Biden off top of 2020 pile

Texto completo: Elizabeth Warren is the new front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
That became clear Tuesday when the Massachusetts senator, 70, was the target of 11 other White House hopefuls on stage at the fourth Democratic debate, in Westerville, Ohio.
Aggressive tactics by her 11 rivals reflect the new reality of the race that Warren has overtaken former Vice President Joe Biden as the favorite to win the Democratic nod and challenge President Trump in 2020, said pollster John Zogby.
"She is indeed the front-runner," Zogby told the Washington Examiner, adding the race is now a two-person contest between her and Biden. "There's a definite and distinct rise in her polling numbers. She's good out there, she's drawing crowds. She clearly raised a lot of money."
But there's always the fear that she's peaked too soon, Zogby explained, citing the Republican 2012 primary where "everybody led for at least a month," before Mitt Romney emerged as the nominee.
"So far there isn't any evidence of her fading, but it could be that she gets tiresome," said Zogby, citing the rise of a little-known Democratic Vermont governor around this time in 2003. "It could be, as in the case of Howard Dean in 2004, that she leads all year and then right before the Iowa causes, 'Pow,' It remains to be seen. We've got a few more months ago."
Biden on Wednesday tried to push back on the notion that he's no longer the favorite for his party's nomination.
"I haven’t seen any polling showing that nationally, on average, that anybody else is the front-runner," Biden said at a union event in Columbus, Ohio.
While tentative about using the word "front-runner," Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll, described Warren "as the one to watch," especially now that she's surpassed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the polls.
"In some polls she has caught Biden, though not in others. Biden has not moved down so much as oscillated between 26% and 30% since the first debate in June. But Warren has moved from 5% in March to close to 25% now, and done it with steady growth, not short-lived bounces," Franklin told the Washington Examiner.
Franklin also warned that Warren's front-runner mantle came with "the challenge of becoming the center of attention and criticism."
David Axelrod, chief strategist for Barack Obama's successful 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, said Warren has earned front-runner status by fending off multiple attacks from rivals on the debate stage Tuesday.
".@ewarren status as front-runner has been certified by the amount of incoming she is getting tonight," he tweeted.
Tweet
Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist and former senior Hillary Clinton aide, praised Warren's handling of the pressure.
"Warren isn't letting anyone land a punch," he wrote.
Tweet
Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, called Tuesday night "the @ewarren debate."
"You might be happy or sad about it, but she's the one who is setting the tone and she's the reference point for most of the other candidates," he added.
Tweet
After an "outlier" Monmouth University poll in August found the contest was a three-way tie between Biden, Warren, and Sanders, Warren has slowly siphoned support from Biden and Sanders in a slew of state and nationwide polls.
Biden and Warren, in particular, have traded places atop of RealClearPolitics' ranking based on polling averages. The senator first seized the lead earlier in October to have a 0.2 percentage point advantage over the former vice president. As of Wednesday, she now trails him by 6 percentage points.

Professors' study names Arizona State-Arizona biggest rivalry in college football

Texto completo: For years, Arizona State University and University of Arizona fans have clamored about how underrated their college football rivalry is.
That might change.
A recent story from the New York Times noted the ASU-Arizona rivalry as one of the biggest in sports and the No. 1 rivalry in all of college football, according to a study conducted by two college professors and published at KnowRivalry. com.
Yes, the Sun Devils and Wildcats were No. 1. You can't be underrated after being named No. 1, can you? Ohio State vs. Michigan came in as the second-biggest rivalry.
The men behind the study are Joe B. Cobbs, an associate professor at Northern Kentucky, and B. David Tyler, an associate professor at Western Carolina.
According to The Times: "The professors sought out hard-core fans of North American professional teams and college football teams and asked them to allocate 100 points among their most-hated rivals. A Minnesota fan might allocate 50 points to Wisconsin, 40 to Iowa and 10 to Michigan. Other fan bases might target their dislike more sharply.
"A UCLA fan might give 80, 90 or even all 100 points to Southern California. Rather, they are the ones where neither team has any other significant rivals to steal away points. Topping the college football chart is Arizona-Arizona State. With no other serious rivals, Arizona fans gave an average of 89 points to their cross-state rival, and Arizona State averaged 83 points back. "
Know Rivalry also named the ASU-Arizona rivalry No. 1 back in 2014.
Cobbs also told The Times he was shocked by how long sports fans hold grudges against certain teams, adding, "Fans name specific moments from specific games and remember the players, even 15 years ago sometimes. ”

Tulsi Gabbard’s take on Syria gets slammed as ‘dead wrong’ during Democratic debate

Texto completo: Tulsi Gabbard came under attack for her stances on Syria during Tuesday’s presidential debate, marring what needed to be a strong performance for the Hawaii congresswoman, who has struggled to gain traction in her bid for the presidency.
Gabbard has made her opposition to American “regime change” wars a cornerstone of her presidential bid, and for several years has accused the U.S. government of arming terrorist groups as part of an attempt to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
But Joe Biden said Gabbard was mischaracterizing American foreign policy in Syria, and fellow veteran Pete Buttigieg called her analysis of the conflict “dead wrong.”


President Donald Trump last week ordered the withdrawal of troops from northern Syria, putting at risk the lives of Syria’s ethnic Kurds, who have been allies in the fight against the Islamic State, and comprising American strategic interests in the region.
Gabbard has argued that withdrawing troops from Syria needed to be done responsibly, and CNN moderator Anderson Cooper pressed her on how she would do that in light of the consequences the U.S. is now facing with Trump’s latest policy decisions.
Gabbard said the problems stemmed from the U.S. waging a regime change war in Syria and that Trump, politicians and the mainstream media had blood on their hands.
“The slaughter of the Kurds being done there by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we have been waging in Syria,” said Gabbard. “Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hands, but so do many of the politicians in this country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media that have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.”
Buttigieg sharply disagreed with Gabbard’s analysis.
“Well, respectfully, congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence; it’s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values,” he said.
Biden also took issue with Gabbard’s response.
“With regard to regime change in Syria — that has not been the policy to change the regime. It has been to make sure the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people,” said Biden.
Peaceful protests in 2011 that were part of a broader democratic movement across the Middle East quickly evolved into a devastating civil war in Syria that’s left several hundred thousand people dead. The U.S. provided limited support to rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
Former President Barack Obama said during the end of his term that the conflict in Syria haunted him, but his administration struggled to devise effective strategies amid an increasingly complicated conflict.
Gabbard’s comments on Syria were also panned on Twitter.
Susan Glasser, a staff writer for The New Yorker and global affairs analyst for CNN, tweeted, “How odd to listen to Tulsi Gabbard mouthing Syrian and Russian talking points on the Democratic debate stage … sorry but no one thinks US troops withdrawn by Trump were there as part of a ‘regime change war’ by the US. It’s as untruthful as anything from POTUS.”
Gabbard, who is at risk of not qualifying for the next Democratic primary debate in November, also tried to take swipes at Elizabeth Warren, who is increasingly seen as a front-runner in the race. At one point she turned to Warren and asked her whether she would join her in calling for an end to “this regime change war in Syria.”
Warren said she didn’t think the U.S. should have troops in the Middle East, but that removing them needed to be done the “right way, the smart way.” Gabbard later tried to question Warren about her qualifications to be commander in chief, but a moderator cut her off.
Gabbard scored only about eight minutes of speaking time during the debate, beating out Tom Steyer, a billionaire businessman. She took part of the time to slam The New York Times and CNN, which moderated the debate. Gabbard has criticized the media throughout her presidential bid.
The “New York Times and CNN have smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war,” said Gabbard. “Just two days ago The New York Times put out an article saying that I’m a Russian asset and Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I’m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.”
The New York Times article that Gabbard referenced did not accuse her of being a Russian asset, but did point out that she had drawn support from Russian state media sources.
Political analyst Bakari Sellers, a former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives, called Gabbard “a puppet for the Russian government” during a CNN segment several hours before the debate.
Gabbard’s overall polling average has hovered around 1%, according to Real Clear Politics. She hasn’t said whether she plans to run for her congressional seat next year where she is facing a challenge by state Sen. Kai Kahele.
Kahele has raised about a half-million dollars for his congressional bid and as of the end of this month had about $ 370,000 in cash on hand, according to campaign financial reports filed Tuesday.
Gabbard raised about $ 3 million this quarter for her presidential bid and had about $ 2.1 million cash on hand. She can generally transfer those funds if she seeks to run for her House seat again.

Texto completo: The Trump administration makes so much news that it's easy to become numb and forget how unprecedented and awful its conduct really is. It's important, therefore, to pause and remember what happened last week. The seven days between Oct. 6 and Oct. 13 saw far, far more corruption, chaos and dysfunction revealed than any other administration has experienced during eight years in office. Not only is the Trump administration profoundly crooked, but it is also so hopelessly inept that it's unable to keep its machinations secret. It's as if the Three Stooges starred in a sequel to "Breaking Bad."
Last week, we received additional confirmation of how outrageously President Trump behaved in his efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden. A second whistleblower emerged with further information about the July 25 call between Zelensky and Trump, and the original whistleblower reported that a White House official who listened in on the call found it "crazy" and "frightening." The Post also reported that political appointees in the White House budget office froze aid to Ukraine despite concerns from career officials that doing so was improper.
The Ukraine scandal deepened when Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, Soviet-born associates of Trump's lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, were arrested by the FBI on charges of violating federal campaign finance laws to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars from murky sources to Republican candidates. While working with Giuliani to dig up dirt on Biden, they were also attempting to profit from their political connections to strike cushy business deals in Ukraine.
Trump claims he was fighting corruption in Ukraine. Instead, he was fostering corruption. Marie Yovanovitch told Congress that she was abruptly fired as ambassador to Ukraine not only because she was unwilling to further Giuliani's plot to malign Biden but also because "individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of Mr. Giuliani may well have believed that their personal financial ambitions were stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine."
By the end of the week, there were reports that Giuliani himself was being investigated by his former colleagues in the Southern District of New York on charges of violating lobbying laws. If Giuliani is indicted, he would join a long list of Trump associates - including the president's personal lawyer, campaign chairman and national security adviser - who have run afoul of the law.
The former mayor of New York also featured prominently in another scandal that broke last week: The New York Times reported that Giuliani and former attorney general Michael Mukasey persuaded Trump to try to release their client, Reza Zarrab, an Iranian-Turkish gold trader who has been sitting in jail on charges of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade sanctions on Iran. Trump asked his then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for help to free Zarrab, but Tillerson refused. In any other administration, this would have been headline news for weeks, but because of the glut of corruption in this administration, this story has come and gone.
Meanwhile, more senior officials left the sinking ship. Acting homeland security secretary Kevin McAleenan - the fourth individual to lead the Department of Homeland Security in the Trump administration - announced he was quitting on Friday, apparently because he objected to being undercut by Trump and other extreme nativists. His critical post will become vacant. Also quitting was Michael McKinley, a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was reportedly upset by "the secretary's lack of public support for diplomats who have been named in the Ukraine controversy."
The courts continued to rebuke the administration for its unlawful conduct. In just one day last week, Trump lost five major court cases concerning his attempts to keep his tax returns secret and to impose draconian restrictions on immigration.
Trump added to the chaos on Oct. 6 by impetuously giving Turkey a green light to invade northern Syria, thereby allowing Islamic State prisoners to escape and the United States' Kurdish allies to be slaughtered.
Seemingly unperturbed by the ethical and geopolitical disasters in his wake, Trump continued with his usual routine: golfing, watching TV (he urged his Twitter followers to vote for his former press secretary Sean Spicer on "Dancing With the Stars"), wallowing in maudlin self-pity ("Serial killers," he tweeted, "get more Due Process than the Democrats give to the President"), and, of course, spewing bombastic insults. At a campaign rally in Minneapolis, Trump reviled not only Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) but also other Somali refugees who have found haven in Minnesota.
Note that this is an incomplete chronicle of only one week. Commentator Charlie Sykes notes that in 1980 the question was: "Are you better off than you were 4 years ago?" In 2020, it will be: "Can you take another four years of this?" I can't even take another week - much less four more years.

Texto completo: On many websites, readers who scroll to the very end of an article are likely to encounter rows of small advertisements belonging to a weird subgenre of digital marketing known as chumbox ads.
Named for the angler's practice of using bits of dead fish to lure other fish, these ads comprise arresting images and baffling text. They have one goal: to make readers click. And when they do, readers may find themselves on an unfamiliar website with an odd name, faced with a photo gallery of regrettable tattoos or a listicle on 22 celebrities with ugly spouses.
Below a review of "Joker" on Slate the other day, there were dozens of chumbox ads.
"Construction Gone Very Wrong, You Will Cry Laughing" blared one, from a site called Travelfuntu, under a photo of an empty swimming pool.
"Lonely Lion Would Not Stop Crying, Until These Puppies Came Along" said another, from a page called Healevate. The image that went with those words showed a pair of dachshunds next to a big cat.
Those with high standards for their online behavior would never admit clicking on this kind of thing. But enough people are curious enough about something like "The 50 Most Evil Looking Buildings on Earth," which was the text line for a recent ad on Business Insider, that the digital offerings that fall under "sponsored content," "suggested reading" or "around the web" have become a multibillion-dollar business.
Last week, in a long-expected coupling of click-bait giants, the two largest chumbox providers decided to merge. Taboola and Out-brain, both based in New York, have agreed to unite under the Taboola name, with Outbrain investors receiving shares equating to 30% of the combined company, plus $250 million in cash. Together, the companies said they bring in more than $2 billion annually in gross revenue.
Outbrain and Taboola make money on each click, paid to them by the websites where readers land. They then give a portion of that revenue to the publishers hosting the ads. In addition to Slate and Business Insider, CNN uses these ads. So does Fox.
Taboola and Outbrain, both founded more than a decade ago, say their services reach more than 2.6 billion people a month through publishers like CNBC, USA Today, Huffington Post, The Washington Post, BBC, The Guardian and others.
"This is clearly working, somehow," said Eric Hadley, the former marketing chief at Outbrain, who is now a marketing executive at iHeart-Media. "You may laugh at these ads, but people click on them."

Housing, human dignity and a ‘state of emergency’

Texto completo: The push by Los Angeles officials to get Governor Newsom to declare a State of Emergency over homelessness is like a warning light flashing.
It draws our attention to a massive problem that people closed their eyes to for too long. But like any flashing light, the “State of Emergency” idea only helps us see part of the problem but not the whole—and ultimately it would deepen the quagmire and probably result in bigger and worse emergencies later.
Where the idea points in the right direction is easy to see: proponents of the State of Emergency rightly say it would streamline red tape on construction, reduce and shorten building approval processes, and block the frivolous use of environmental review to delay housing construction. That’s needed.
But let’s face it, here’s what’s really happening: First California passes laws that generate the crisis, then we declare a state of emergency to bypass those laws. But as a State of Emergency exemption, it’s an ad-hoc fix. It doesn’t address the systemic problem with the laws it sidesteps, and in fact it politicizes the whole situation further by allowing sensible construction only if political support for a formal Emergency can be cultivated.
But it gets worse. Some of the people who favor a State of Emergency also favor a so-called “legal right to shelter” which would create a basis to sue governments if they don’t directly provide housing to the poorest citizens. This would permanently turn the homeless into wards of the state and enrich those who would litigate on their behalf.
The homeless are indeed “victims of the system,” but not the system that most people think of. They are not victims of a free market in housing, because California has built a regulatory system that killed a free market in housing at all but the top price levels. Middle-income Californians are squeezed by this, too, but the most vulnerable Californians are pushed out on to the streets. The bottom rungs of the housing market ladder—where economically marginal citizens could once afford a place to live—have effectively been removed by bad public policy.
Let me give examples from a study soon to be published by the Independent Institute.
Los Angeles currently bans any housing other than detached single-family homes on about 75 percent of its residential land. Whereas in 1960 Los Angeles was zoned for up to 10 million people, by 1990 the city “had downzoned to a capacity of about 3.9 million, a number that is only slightly higher today,” according to the New York Times.
Then there are so-called “prevailing wage” (read: union scale) laws. Prevailing-wage mandates increased average California construction costs for affordable housing projects by between 10 percent and 25 percent, according to a May 2017 report from the California Center for Jobs and the Economy. In areas such as Los Angeles, PLAs could hike market-rate housing prices by as much as 46 percent. Then there are the endless faux-environmental lawsuits against residential construction, which are invited and inadvertently enabled by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). And the list of anti-housing obstacles goes on.
What the homeless really need is a residential construction market that operates by normal rules that induce entrepreneurs to build housing all the way up and down the price spectrum—not just at the top where they can afford to overcome the regulatory and NIMBY hurdles. Don’t give the homeless a “right to shelter” by government; instead, give property owners a “right to build residential housing” on land they own. No, this would not eliminate restrictions on residential building, but it would raise a much higher bar by which to justify them. A ballot initiative amending the California Constitution would be the way to achieve this potent reform.
Less dramatic reforms would make a difference, too.
Allow builders to give homeowners’ associations incentives to accept new construction, so as to counterbalance the disincentives that lead to NIMBYism. Stop suppressing housing through rent controls and so-called “affordable housing” mandates; these are the functional equivalent of taxes on housing development. What you tax you get less of. Another obvious change would be to put an end to the favoritism shown to unions through “prevailing wage” rules that swell construction costs. And why not abolish or at least vastly modify CEQA?
The people who care the most about the homeless are those who want to reintroduce a real housing market—and incentivize nongovernmental programs that treat people like people rather than like dependent clients.
How can we expect the homeless to rebuild their lives when government programs warehouse them like surplus merchandise, and when we kick the bottom rungs out of the housing market ladder so that even if they start getting themselves together, they can’t find a room or apartment they can afford to rent?
Graham Walker is executive director of the Independent Institute, based in Oakland.

Andrew Yang forces Democratic debate on universal basic income, his plan to send every adult a $1K check

Texto completo: Andrew Yang forced a discussion at Tuesday night's Democratic presidential debate on his proposal for a Universal Basic Income, a plan to send every adult a government check.
Yang, the former entrepreneur running on the platform of implementing a UBI, as it's known, kicked off a debate about the idea among the candidates when he attacked rival candidate Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' plan for a federal jobs program. Yang argued it was impractical and not what most voters truly wanted.
"I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job?" the former tech executive said, asserting that most Americans don't want to work for the federal government. "Saying that that is the vision of the economy the 21st-century economy to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace."
He added that a federal jobs guarantee "does not take into account the work of people like my wife who is at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic."
Yang's proposal would give $1,000 cash monthly without any conditions, which he dubs a "freedom dividend." He argues that the payment would be productive than federally supported jobs. "We know this in Ohio: If you rely up on the federal government to target its resources, you end up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants," he said.
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker responded to Yang's proposal by arguing that a higher minimum wage would be better. "We need to raise the minimum wage to $15," he said. "That would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month."
Booker added that boosting unionization was also important because there "under attack." He would purse that goal by promoting "sectoral bargaining," which involves using collective bargaining to create uniform standards for entire industries. "Unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country," he said.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren argued that the jobs problem was primarily the result of bad trade policy brought about by corporate influence. She proposed requiring 40% of a company's board of directors be elected by the employees: "That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?"

Texto completo: When Ukrainian autocrat Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia after a popular uprising in 2014, thousands of citizens poured into Mezhyhirya, his 340-acre estate on the outskirts of Kyiv.
Ordinary people, eager to see the lifestyle Yanukovych’s thievery had financed, found an opulent palace filled with chandeliers, exquisite inlaid wood and gilt. It had a private movie theater, bowling alley, golf course, dog kennel and ostrich farm. A tunnel connected the main house to a spa with an oxygen chamber and rooms devoted to different styles of massage. There was a sauna where journalists and activists dried out documents that members of the fallen regime had thrown into a lake before they departed.
Astonishingly, there was little looting. Instead, Mezhyhirya was preserved as a sort of memorial to the corruption Ukrainians have endured. Its grounds are a park where families stroll; on a visit there last week, I saw a newly married couple posing for pictures. For about $20, a veteran of the revolution will take visitors on a tour of the main house, carefully pointing out every luxurious detail financed with public money.
Mezhyhirya is a reminder of how far the country has come in the 5 1/2 years since what Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity. Certainly, Ukraine has manifold problems, but today it’s a remarkably vibrant, multiethnic democracy in a region full of aggressive nationalism and authoritarian backsliding. That makes it all the more contemptible that Donald Trump has leveraged U.S. support for Ukraine to try to make its new president open investigations that would help Trump politically. Ukraine is a country struggling to transcend its history of corruption, and Trump has tried to make it behave more corruptly.
“This is the big country in Eastern Europe which is trying to fight with the old demons of the past, and is partly successful,” said Nataliya Gumenyuk, the head of Hromadske, a nonprofit television channel and multimedia news organization. “Today it’s probably a better democracy than Hungary and Poland in terms of political representation, political freedoms.”
Ukraine once had a history of murderous anti-Semitism; today its new president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is a Jew. As Yaroslav Trofimov pointed out in The Wall Street Journal, “One of Mr. Zelenskiy’s first decisions was to scrap the Independence Day tank parade on Kyiv’s main avenue, instead showcasing the country’s young musicians — and a different vision of national pride.”
The new Parliament is full of young reformers, including Ukraine’s first black MP, Zhan Beleniuk. Before Paul Manafort was Trump’s campaign chairman, he helped Yanukovych rise to power by stoking ethnic division. Ukraine’s new generation of leaders — the ones Trump has referred to as “terrible people” — have moved in the opposite direction.
“Ukraine, disregarding what Mr. Trump says, it’s a success case for Eastern Europe,” said Gumenyuk. “If Ukraine succeeds, everybody is watching in the region — Moldovans, Belarussians, the Caucasus, Central Asia. If this country slides back to old times, or goes in the Russian direction, the region is lost.”
There was once a bipartisan conviction in Congress that such an outcome would be calamitous. But Trump obviously has no problem with Russia expanding its influence. He has no interest in seeing liberal democracy thrive in Eastern Europe or anywhere else. For liberal Ukrainians, earnestly trying to live up to Western ideals that the world’s most powerful Western country is in the process of abandoning, this new geopolitical situation has been deeply alarming.
“It’s extremely important that our integrity, our image, our hard work that we’ve been carrying out over these years, our fight for freedom, our fight for democracy, is continuously supported by our partners,” said Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze, Ukraine’s former vice prime minister for European and Euro-Atlantic integration, told me. “And this is the major challenge right now.”
It almost doesn’t matter, said Gumenyuk, that after freezing military aid to Ukraine, Trump eventually unfroze it. The aid was militarily necessary, but it was also seen as symbolic, “to show Russia that the U.S. is on our side,” she said. “And now it is clear that Trump is not on the Ukrainians’ side.” The shock of this is something Western-oriented Ukrainians are only beginning to grapple with.
Those who dream of a more open society have no other power to turn to. President Emmanuel Macron of France wants to reach out to Russia to forestall the influence of China. The U.K. is roiled by Brexit. Ukrainian liberals I met with last week kept using the same phrase — they spoke of being “left alone” with Russia.
“It’s important to understand that it’s not about Ukraine, it’s about whether democracy and the rule of law are spreading farther to the east,” said Volodymyr Yermolenko, a philosopher who hosts a program about world politics for Hromadske, or whether the “new authoritarianism” will keep moving westward. Under Trump, America has joined the axis of autocrats. Unlike the last time authoritarianism was on the march across Europe, for democrats in vulnerable countries, it’s hard to see where the allies are.

Texto completo: When Kanye West’s “Jesus Walks” was released in 2004, the song was praised for boldly bringing discussions of faith into hip-hop. Fifteen years later, Mr. West’s contemporaries continue to speak of its impact. In the first episode of “Hip-Hop: The Songs That Shook America,” an AMC docu-series that premiered Sunday, the singer-songwriter John Legend said, “Kanye made it O.K. to talk about your faith in songs that weren’t Christian songs.”
It is this persistent reverie and good will for “Jesus Walks” that Mr. West has banked on since starting Sunday Service, a series of obliquely religious pop-up gatherings featuring a gospel choir (usually wearing attire from the rapper’s clothing line Yeezy) this year.
The set lists fluctuate from week to week. But the linchpin of the productions, which segue from traditional songs of mercy and salvation to bolder reconfigurations of modern secular hits, is in that subversive single from his debut album, “The College Dropout” — the artist jubilantly recites the final verse of the song, flexing his cadence in lock step with the choir.
On an invitation-only basis (or in the case of Coachella last April, the price of a steep festival ticket), the select few present at these gatherings get to rub shoulders with the likes of ASAP Rocky, Chance the Rapper, Brad Pitt and other high-profile entertainers while partaking of the “exclusive” experience. The events serve as a transparent attempt of Mr. West to fundamentally regroup himself within the context of religion after an extended run of willfully courting salacious controversy, whether it be for an unsolicited dressing down of Taylor Swift, his wearing of a MAGA hat or a contentious TMZ appearance in which he claimed that slavery was a “choice.”
But the endeavor reads like a blatantly self-serving appropriation of black faith traditions, and the Sunday Service performances are in fact little more than concerts trading in aimless aphorisms and the cult of Mr. West’s personality — so much so that it has become a running joke that he’s running an actual cult. Black Christians have expressed skepticism about his intentions, and the rapper’s past comments about how he views the relationship between hip-hop and church provide reason for their concern.
“Hip-hop is a religion to a certain extent, and the rappers are the preachers, the music is the scriptures, you know?” Mr. West says in an archival clip resurfaced in the docu-series. “It’s just like church, because you go to a concert, you raise your hands in the air, you sing songs and you definitely pay some money. It’s just like church.”
The description of Sunday Service provided by his wife, Kim Kardashian West, during an appearance on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” doesn’t help: “There’s no praying, there’s no sermon. There’s no word. It’s just music, and it’s just a feeling.”
The reduction of the black faith tradition to “just music” is precisely what has become of a similar profit-making endeavor for some black places of worship. For nearly 30 years there have been Sunday church service tours of Harlem landmarks such as Mother African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (New York City’s oldest black church) and Abyssinian Baptist Church, with foot traffic accelerating at the turn of the century. Tourists pay concert ticket prices to enter into a hallowed spiritual ground for a glimpse of a famed choir, as opposed to consuming a spiritual service and grasping the significance of the churches’ histories. Gospel is reduced to a commodity, as opposed to a legacy.
That tension was said to be evident in Mr. West’s grandstanding performance at the Greater Allen African Methodist Episcopal Cathedral church last month, which occurred during a confusing promotion for what is supposed to be his forthcoming album, “Jesus Is King.” (The album was slated for release Sept. 27, but has yet to be made commercially available — although a complementary documentary of the same name is to open in IMAX theaters Oct. 25.)
The early, more conventional musical invocations of praise and faith from the choir gave way to a freestyle performance, as Mr. West claimed to be a rapper “with a purpose, not just for surface.” The choir, filling in the first few pews of the church as opposed to the traditional positioning on the stage platforms, reacted exuberantly, dancing, jumping and engaging in unison while the churchgoers — several of whom reportedly walked out — looked on.
These performances have helped grant Mr. West a certain grace that, it should be noted, has not been afforded to artists who have been maligned for similar sins of a smaller scale, such as Chrisette Michele, a singer with gospel roots who in 2017 was widely criticized for performing at President Trump’s inauguration. Clips of Sunday Service have been circulated online with enthusiasm and proclamations as though he were breaking new ground in music.
But a mash-up of a gospel song with an R&B song — Ginuwine’s romantic slow-jam “So Anxious,” for one — is hardly novel. (Kirk Franklin and other gospel artists have been remixing secular songs in church for years.) Likewise, with “Jesus Walks,” Mr. West was just one of several rappers — including M.C. Hammer, Diddy and DMX before him — to usher in a cycle of faith exploration in mainstream hip-hop, as Billboard’s Naima Cochrane and others have pointed out.
Even if “Jesus Walks” isn’t as wholly original as his peers would have you believe, there remains a power in the song’s origins that seems to have been lost today. The Addicts Rehabilitation Center Choir, led by its founder, James Allen, recorded “Walk With Me,” an arrangement of a gospel hymn, in 1997. In “The Songs That Shook America,” a choir member says that they were singing for their lives as they originally performed the song.
It’s a distinct call of faith and conviction, the essence of which Mr. West, at his best, distilled into the hook of “Jesus Walks” in 2004, which samples “Walk With Me”: “God show me the way, because the Devil’s trying to break me down.”
When viewing clips of Mr. West’s performance of the song during Sunday Service halls, however, it registers as a facsimile of the sentiment and legacy it once represented, a mere interlude for conveying nondescript “God is love” statements or defensive, egotistic rants. During his recent service in Salt Lake City, he railed against those who have criticized him for his friendly relationship with President Trump and the Republican Party: “I ain’t never made a decision only based off my color. That’s a form of slavery, mental slavery.”
Iconoclasm, even at its most crude execution, typically runs afoul of the conventions of religion. If “Jesus Walks” is a song that he created to focus on the sins of man, as his co-writer Rhymefest (born Che Smith) has stated, his first reckoning should be with the paradox of spreading the farce of original thought as dictated through the filter of the church of Kanye West.

Texto completo: A graphic video showing President Donald Trump's likeness slaughtering journalists and political foes played in a side room during a recent conference at his golf club in Doral.
The video had quietly circulated online for months with only a small number of views. That changed quickly when the doctored clip became a national story.
Americans didn't avert their eyes. They started clicking and sharing the graphic clip, according to data from Social Blade, which tracks Internet traffic.
TheGeekzTeam YouTube channel, where the video could be watched, racked up more than 250,000 views Monday. On a typical day, the channel garners 600 to 800 views, according to Social Blade.
The New York Times broke the news Sunday night that the bloody video was played during the three-day American Priority conference at Trump National Doral Miami. It wasn't a gathering of outsiders - the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., was among those in attendance.
The incident highlights how memes and increasingly violent messaging have crept into mainstream politics, said Joshua Scacco, a political scientist at the University of South Florida.
"Yes, these exist," he said. "For most people using the Internet it's rare you'll come across these violent ones. You have to go searching for them. The challenge is the profile got elevated quite a bit by where it was shown."
Alex Phillips, who organized the conference, distanced himself from the video in a prepared statement, saying it was unsanctioned and shown in a side room.
In the video, a man with Trump's head superimposed goes on a rampage in the "Church of Fake News," shooting, stabbing and assaulting parishioners who have the faces of his critics or the logos of news media outlets for their heads. The victims include media outlets such as CNN and The Washington Post, along with the late Sen. John McCain, the comedian Rosie O'Donnell and former President Barack Obama.
The clip is an edited scene from the 2014 action film "Kingsman: The Secret Service."
TheGeekzTeam, which describes itself as a channel "dedicated to pissing off liberals," contributes content to the website MemeWorld. That pro-Trump site was created by Logan Cook, known online as "Carpe Donktum."
Cook defended the video in a statement published on the website.
"The Kingsman video is CLEARLY satirical and the violence depicted is metaphoric," he wrote. "No reasonable person would believe that this video was a call to action, or an endorsement of violence towards the media. The only person that could potentially be "incited" by this video is Donald Trump himself, as the main character of the video is him. THERE IS NO CALL TO ACTION."
YouTube added an age restriction to the video, said Ivy Choi, a YouTube company spokeswoman. As of 8 p.m. Monday, the video appeared to have been taken down because of a copyright claim. A message left with TheGeekzTeam was not immediately returned Monday night.
Politicians on both sides of the aisle condemned the video. Some feared it could incite real-world violence. South Florida is home to Cesar Sayoc, 57, an ardent Trump supporter who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for mailing inoperative pipe bombs to the president's political foes.
U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-West Boca, told CNN on Monday that his "blood is boiling" and demanded Trump immediately condemn the video.
"He ought to have the good sense at least on this one occasion, stand up and speak out against this and deplore it and condemn it," Deutch said. "If he's got any sense of decency, the president will do that today. I don't think too many of us are hopeful that will happen."
As pressure mounted, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham wrote on Twitter that Trump had not seen the video, but "based upon everything he has heard, he strongly condemns this video." The president did not attend the Thursday to Saturday event in Doral.
Trump has shared other violent memes on Twitter, albeit less graphic ones than the video shown at the Doral conference. In July 2017, he tweeted a video that depicted him wrestling a man to the ground that had the CNN logo superimposed on his head.
The conference's schedule of speakers included Gov. Ron DeSantis; Trump Jr.; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the president's former press secretary; and other top Trump surrogates. Sanders told The New York Times she did not see the video. A source told the Times that Trump Jr. did not see the video.

Adam Schiff is hiding details about Democratic impeachment case because it's weak

Texto completo: House Democrats confident that their push for impeachment is a political slam-dunk might want to figure out how they can reconcile two contradictory facts.
On the one hand, they say that there is a clear case for impeachment that every voter can understand. On the other, Rep. Adam Schiff, who is leading the charge, is doing everything possible to keep the details surrounding the impeachment charge secret.
If impeachment is a sure thing, why hasn’t there been a vote on it yet?
If it’s so easy to understand, why is Schiff hiding key information about it from the public?
Asked Sunday on CBS’s Face the Nation about holding closed-door hearings with witnesses in the impeachment pursuit, Schiff all but admitted that the whole truth about the Democrats’ case isn’t really important.
“We want to make sure that we meet the needs of the investigation,” he said, “and not give the president or his legal minions the opportunity to tailor their testimony and in some cases fabricate testimony to suit their interests.”
In other words, Schiff doesn’t believe that Trump deserves the chance to confront his accusers — to respond to the full content of every secret hearing hosted by Schiff. Instead, Schiff believes the White House should only be allowed to respond to the selective bits that he and his Democrat colleagues decide to leak to the media.
Isn’t that exactly what you would do if you were confident that you had an unimpeachable case for impeachment?
“This has clarity and understanding in the eyes of the American people,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California reportedly said in a private meeting with colleagues last month.
Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan, has said she believes that “everybody understands” the “very clear threat to national security and to our Constitution” that rose from the phone call.
New York Times' Charles Blow, master of original metaphors, has written this week that “the clarity” of Trump’s “transgression” on the call is “as clear as a bell.”
Eugene Robinson at the Washington Post has confidently declared that “it is not in question” that Trump “committed at least one impeachable offense” and that his “misconduct” is “easy to understand.”
If the case is so “easy to understand,” then when is the vote? Where are the articles of impeachment? Why is Schiff hiding the ball?
They won’t answer those questions. And the march to impeachment suddenly doesn’t look so hot.

Purple &amp; Bold: China, the NBA and the limits of basketball diplomacy

Texto completo: Editor’s note: This is the Monday, Oct. 14 edition of the Purple & Bold Lakers newsletter. To receive breaking Lakers news and the newsletter in your inbox, sign up here.
The NBA has a program called Basketball Without Borders, a community service initiative that has run camps in 27 different countries over the last two decades. The dream goes something like this: Through the game of basketball, diverse cultures can find some common ground.
But the world as we know it has borders — not just geopolitical lines on a map, but borders of ideology and values. And never have the limits of NBA diplomacy become more apparent than last week.
The Lakers and Nets unwittingly put themselves in the midst of an international incident this week because of a tweet. It’s a weird situation, especially given that the Chinese response has felt particularly outsized, but it’s highlighted what the limitations are for a game to be a unifying force in a world with endlessly complex divisions.
The NBA became so aware of the thorny nature of the politics of the situation that they shut down media availability for the entire trip. The Athletic reported that players, most prominently LeBron James, were wary of the onus for the NBA’s response to China’s actions being put on them, and asked to not be made available for questions. Rather than putting players in position to say something harmful either abroad or at home (like James Harden awkwardly apologizing to China for his general manager’s tweet), the NBA and the player’s association wanted avoid commentary “in real time,” at least until everyone was safely home.
It should be noted here that China is a country that tightly controls and restricts visas: Journalists, for example, require multiple references to just get in. Multiple times, the government kept the NBA in the dark as to whether they would even be allowed to participate in their events. A situation where the Chinese government harassed or detained a player for something they said while visiting abroad could have felt like a very real threat to the traveling contingent. If that’s the case, Adam Silver probably made a wise choice to keep them out of the line of fire.
But now that everyone is safely home, where does it go from here? The NBA would probably prefer this situation quietly goes away, and that they can continue their lucrative contracts in a country where basketball has been increasingly popular. The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese government was toning down rhetoric against the NBA — which make sense because the incident has drawn attention to their authoritarian handling of the Hong Kong protests. It’s bad diplomacy to cut off a league that’s well-liked in the country, disappointing fans locally and making observers abroad question whether they should do business there.
But it seems difficult to imagine this will go away soon. Next year, the NBA will be pressed to continue exhibition games in China: Which teams are going to want to go? Which teams are going to want their players subjected to questions about what it’s like to be the first teams to play since the international incident that briefly flared up tensions between the NBA and China? What do they think of how China handles Hong Kong (because in a year, a lack of knowledge on the situation will be a less convincing case)?
In absence of the voices of players and other NBA personnel who actually went to China, Steve Kerr’s voice stood out among people stateside who spoke on the issue. Well, “spoke” might be a strong word, but Kerr offered that it’s easier for NBA players and coaches to speak on social issues that are close to home. That’s understandable, and it does seem like an unfair burden to expect the NBA to set the example for all US-Chinese relations in all cases.
But it’s also true that the NBA’s reputation as a league that’s outspoken and unafraid to speak the truth on important issues is taking some hits.
As Kerr put it: “Using the game as a force for the greater good. I think those things are important, those values are important. Obviously, there are tremendous financial forces at play here — so how you reconcile all that, I don’t know.”
No one else in the NBA appears to know either.
In the interest of examining the issue, I’m dropping a lot of related reading down in the links.
BUT WHY TONIGHT?
If you’re surprised to see a Lakers-Warriors home game less than 72 hours after the Lakers last played in China, it’s hard to imagine that the Lakers are thrilled about it either.
It’s unclear if players will miss the game due to fatigue. It’s easy to imagine LeBron James, for example, sitting this one out, especially if Anthony Davis is unable to play following his MRI on his sprained thumb. Preseason games, it should be noted, are firmly under control of teams. But it’s also true that any team going to China is hard-pressed to squeeze six preseason games into its schedule.
Frank Vogel said earlier this month that he would be judicious when it came to divvying up time for the long preseason schedule: “I think they made a wise decision a couple years back to reduce it from 8 preseason games to six. Potentially could go even further down to four. I think each coach has an obligation to their team to make sure they’re being smart with their vets. Make sure they’re getting enough reps to learn their new teammates and the system. Get sharp, ready to play, but not overdo it.”

Texto completo: En 2020, la comunidad latina romperá un nuevo récord y liderará a los grupos minoritarios con mayor poder electoral al sumar más de 32 millones de posibles votantes . A todos ellos, el único candidato de este grupo social, Julián Castro , les tiene un mensaje claro: registrarse e ir a votar.
En entrevista, Castro destaca el valor de los hispanos en los Estados Unidos y cómo esa fuerza electoral puede inclinar la balanza. Según los últimos datos del Pew Research Center, de 2016 a 2020, el número de votantes latinos aumentaría alrededor de cinco millones, lo que representará el 13% de los sufragios para elegir al nuevo presidente.
“La comunidad latina debe participar en la elección, no hay momento más importante que ahora” , expresó Castro. “Es claro que necesitamos reemplazar a este presidente, por un presidente que realmente considere la necesidad de crear oportunidades para todos, en un Estados Unidos que pertenece a todos”.
El exfuncionario de la administración de Barack Obama , tiene 45 años y expresa con claridad que una de sus prioridades –aunque no la única– son los inmigrantes en este país, considerando su propia historia, mejor dicho, la historia de su abuela, Victoria , quien migró de México a los siete años como indocumentada. La suya es la historia de millones de personas. Castro lo tiene claro y siente que tiene una deuda con ellos como político, pero sin dejar de lado que necesita convencer al electorado de que no solamente lucharía por ellos. No es un reto sencillo.
“Quiero representar a todos los estadounidenses, pero al mismo tiempo, considerando mi origen, me he dado cuenta de que… en este momento, muchos los latinos hemos sido objetivo de esta Administración y tenemos que hacer grandes cambios para asegurarnos, todos puedan encontrar sus oportunidades y alcanzar sus sueños”, expresó. “He estado enfocado particularmente en la visión de que en Estados Unidos todos cuentan y cada quien puede ser exitoso por su trabajo”.
La pregunta es obligada, quizá incómoda, pero obligada. ¿No cree que puedan verlo como un aspirante enfocado solamente en inmigración? En el diálogo que se desarrolla vía telefónica desde Texas, el demócrata respira, pero es contundente.
“No”, expresa escuetamente, para luego acotar: “He hablado de otros aspectos con el mismo énfasis que éste, he hablado de educación, de economía, del plan de salud, reforma policiaca… en los medios me enfocan como que estoy enfocado en inmigración, pero no es el caso” .
Su plataforma electoral es amplia y no comienza con inmigración, sino con un programa para protección de niños sin familia y sigue con el empoderamiento de los sindicatos , plan de justicia para granjeros , proyecto para proteger a las empleadas domésticas , plan económico para las familias trabajadoras , plan ambiental contra cambio climático y protección de especies, lucha contra terrorismo doméstico (como grupos supremacistas), atender a comunidades indígenas , reformar el sistema judicial , mejorar la educación y asegurar el derecho a la vivienda .
Castro cree que puede lograr un gran cambio para este país y pone su historia personal y política como ejemplo.
“He demostrado en toda mi carrera que soy ese tipo de líder y que tengo un gran plan” , insistió. “La comunidad latina es parte de esta dinámica y de las posibilidades de este país”.
Tras conseguir donaciones de 130,000 personas y obtener un apoyo del 2 por ciento en cuatro encuestas aprobadas por la Convención Nacional Demócrata entre el 28 de junio y el 1 de octubre, Castro logró su pase al cuarto debate, que será este martes 15 de octubre a las 8:00 p.m. del Este desde la Universidad de Otterbein, Columbus, Ohio, y será transmitido por CNN y The New York Times.
Es la gran oportunidad para este aspirante latino para convencer a más votantes de las primarias que debe ser el candidato presidencial en 2020, pero el reto es complicado, considerando que en las encuestas de intención de votos está lejos de los líderes: el exvicepresidente Biden, la senadora Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) –cada vez más cercana al puntero– y el senador Bernie Sanders .
Los esfuerzos de Castro y su equipo de campaña están enfocados no solamente en el evento de este martes, sino también en el próximo debate que será transmitido por MSNBC, en colaboración con The Washington Post, el 20 de noviembre desde Georgia.
Aquellos que ya tienen casi asegurado su pase son el exvicepresidente Biden, el alcalde de Indiana, Pete Buttigieg , la senadora Warren y el senador Sanders.
Los demás deben lograr 165,000 donantes únicos, incluidos 600 repartidos en 20 estados, y alcanzar el 3 por ciento en cuatro encuestas estatales o nacionales calificadas, además de lograr un 5 por ciento en dos encuestas estatales calificadas. Castro lucha por mantenerse en la carrera.
“Nuestra confianza es que mi campaña lo logre, tenemos hasta noviembre 12, es un gran desafío para todos los candidatos” , expresó.

Georgia Southern president responds to book burning

Texto completo: Georgia Southern University President Kyle Marrero has released a statement condemning the burning of books after a number of freshmen students were shown on video doing so.
"I know many of you are concerned and disappointed about the incidents that have been reported over the past two days following a visiting professor's talk on our Statesboro campus," Marrero said in an email to students. "From what we have been able to determine, the night's events were another example of freedom of expression and a continuing debate of differing ideas, which are tenets of our ongoing efforts to align with our values and initiatives encompassing inclusive excellence. Specific to the reported events of that evening, while it's within the students' First Amendment rights, book burning does not align with Georgia Southern's values nor does it encourage the civil discourse and debate of ideas."
A video emerged on Twitter on Wednesday of students outside Eagle Village, a freshman housing complex at Georgia Southern's Statesboro campus, burning a copy of "Make Your Home Among Strangers," a book assigned for the university's First Year Experience class.
The video, posted by Twitter user @elainaaan, was captioned with "They're burning the FYE book... because of the author."
The book burning followed a talk at the campus from Latina author and New York Times contributor Jennine Capó Crucet on Wednesday.
Crucet discussed her book and the topic of white privilege to an audience of freshmen students at the Statesboro campus. The book follows a Cuban-American student navigating the college experience at a predominantly white institution.
A statement released by GS's Writing and Linguistics Department on Thursday read: "Last night's discussion with the author devolved into accusations of her demonstrating racism against white people. Some students burned copies of Crucet's book and even gathered outside her hotel. We assert that destructive and threatening acts do not reflect the values of Georgia Southern University."
On Sunday, the department released an updated statement correcting Thursday's release, which read: "Students did not gather outside her hotel, as stated earlier. I regret that I had included this unconfirmed statement and apologize for the error," Department Chair Russell Willerton said.
Crucet was scheduled to speak at Georgia Southern's Armstrong campus last Thursday, but the event was cancelled for safety concerns.
During the Q&A portion of her Wednesday lecture, a student confronted Crucet about the view on white privilege expressed in the book.
In a video posted by user @___yanamarie on Twitter, the student asks Crucet, "So I've noticed you've made a lot of generalizations about the majority of white people being privileged, and I just wanted to know what makes you qualified to come to a college campus?"
The student then quickly corrects the comment by stating they understand Crucet's qualifications before Crucet interjects and tells the Statesboro audience it feels like deja vu.
"I'm asking you what makes you think you can come to a college campus like this when we're supposed to be promoting diversity throughout this campus, which is what we're taught?" the student continues on the video.
In the video, some in the auditorium sound off with comments before she completes her question.
"I just would like to know why you came here to tell all of these people that white people are privileged. I don't really understand what the purpose of this was." a student asks in the video.
Crucet responded by saying white privilege was real and that she was invited to come talk at the university.
On Twitter, Georgia Southern students, alumni and others tweeted their positions after learning some students burned her book.
Crucet also said that some students apologized for the overall reaction from the initial question pertaining to white privilege. She also said some Georgia Southern students reached out during and afterward on how her book mirrored their own journeys.
"To think of those students watching as a group of their peers burned that story - effectively erasing them on the campus they are expected to think of as a safe space - feels devastating," the statement reads.

Impeachment inquiry has Tallahassee roots

Texto completo: The House's push to impeach President Trump is rooted in allegations leveled by Tallahassee author Peter Schweizer, who runs a think tank co-founded by Steve Bannon and backed by conservative donors and Trump supporters.
"Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends" – which shot to No. 1 when it was released March 2018 – provided the basis for Trump's attacks against former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter and his business dealings in the Ukraine.
But it appears to have backfired, providing fuel for House Democrats in their impeachment investigation.
"The irony is that the target was supposed to be the Bidens, not the president," Bloomberg political columnist Joshua Green told NPR's Fresh Air this week.
The impeachment investigation has zeroed in on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelesky, where Trump urged him to "do us a favor" and investigate the Bidens.
"There's a lot of talk about Biden's son," Trump is quoted as saying.
The CIA whistleblower wrote in his report that Trump was using the power of his office to pressure a foreign power to interfere in the 2020 U.S. election.
Schweizer, a senior contributor at the conservative Breitbart website once run by former Trump advisor Bannon, said in a recent op-ed piece that he didn't think what Biden's son did was illegal but raises the specter of undue influence. He devoted equal space to questions about Elaine Chao, the secretary of Transportation who is married to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Schweizer is the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a not-for-profit research organization based in Tallahassee that he co-founded with Bannon in 2012. It has received millions in support from the Koch Family's Donors Trust and from the Mercer Family Foundation, a nonprofit that funds many conservative organizations. Rebekah Mercer is listed as a director of GAI.
GAI's mission statement is to "investigate crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies, and other governmental corruption or malfeasance."
Schweizer, who has lived in Tallahassee since 1994, did not return a call or text message seeking comment for this story, but told the Democrat last year in an article about the book, "We have eight researchers and 16 employees."
Those researchers use forensic tools and specialized databases to research the financial connections of the families of the powerful, he said. It took over a year to get the main facts of the Biden narrative, and still left a lot of questions unanswered, he said.
"Secret Empires" delves into the extremes politicians will go to enrich themselves while in office, according to a New York Times book review. An Amazon synopsis says that children of powerful politicians go into business with people who want to curry favor with their influential parents.
Included are stories about McConnell and Chao and a multi-million dollar gift from her father. The House oversight committee is investigating allegations that she used her office to benefit her family's shipping business.
It also talks about Hunter Biden's business dealings while his father was vice president under Barack Obama. It delves into a $1.5 billion private equity deal involving Hunter Biden and a bank owned by the Chinese government, as well as his business association with Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian natural gas company.
In a recent Bloomberg column, Green makes the case that "Secret Empires" is a "political hit job" that follows the same game plan as "Clinton Cash," which Bannon used to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016.
"Looking ahead to 2020, it wasn't hard to foresee that a moderate, two-term vice president like Joe Biden, popular across the party, was likely to run for president and be a good bet to win," Green said. "Nor was it difficult for GAI to turn up examples of ethically questionable behavior by Biden's family members and publish the information in 'Secret Empires.'"
But "Secret Empires" didn't have the same impact with mainstream media as "Clinton Cash" had, Green said.
Trump was impatient to advance the story he believed would damage Biden, so he tried to get his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to get the new Ukrainian government to investigate, Green said.
Giuliani told CNN that "a well-regarded investigator" had brought Hunter Biden's story to his attention, Green said.
Schweizer told Green it wasn't him. "I don't know Rudy and I've had no contact with Trump or the White House," he told Green.

OCTOPI EXPANDS REACH; COMPANY'S $11 MILLION PROJECT ABOUT MORE THAN BEER

Texto completo: Isaac Showaki isn't quite ready to change the name of his company but an $11 million expansion project at his Octopi Brewing Co. is more than just about beer.
A major part of the upgrade is $3.5 million in equipment that will fully plunge his business into the production of non-alcoholic teas, sodas, seltzers, coffees, flavored waters and beer along with alcoholic cocktails. Showaki's brewery still makes beer in 50 barrel batches but he now refers to the company he founded in 2014 and opened a year later as a beverage co-packer.
Located in the Waunakee Business Park next door to the village's indoor ice arena dubbed "The Ice Pond," Octopi is expected to brew about 55,000 barrels of product by the end of 2019. About 90 percent of that will be beer and most of it will be not for Octopi's brands but for other beer companies on contract. The expansion will help him push that number to 90,000 barrels of beer in 2020 but an additional 30,000 barrels will be non-beer items.
Showaki sees the move into other products not traditionally aligned with a brewing company as an essential addition in order to compete in the crowded craft beer market. His ultimate goal is to have beer comprise only about 50 to 60 percent of his production.
"In the next two to three years I'm sure that's going to be my mix," Showaki said. "The beer market is not great. It's totally saturated. We saw this coming about two years ago and decided to make the investment. The market (for non-alcoholic beverages) is much bigger."
Saturated market
Overall U.S. beer sales by volume were down 1% in 2018 but craft beer sales from the country's more than 7,000 craft breweries grew 4% by volume and made up 13.2% of the U.S. beer market by volume, according to the Brewers Association. Sales of craft beer measured in dollars increased 7% to $27.6 billion last year and now account for more than 24% of the $114.2 billion U.S. beer market.
In 2008, the country was home to 1,574 breweries of all types while Wisconsin was home to just more than 60 craft breweries and brewpubs. Today the state has 190 craft beer operations that crank out more than 1 million barrels of beer a year, which ranks 10th nationally and creates a $2.3 billion economic impact, according to the Brewers Association.
The continued growth has left liquor and grocery stores with little room for new products, distributors overwhelmed and bars and restaurants left trying to decide which beers to squeeze into their limited cooler space or hook up to their taps. In addition, those who drink craft beer are no longer are loyal to one brand, preferring instead to try new entries from not just one brewing company but several.
"Overall demand for beers from small and independent brewers continues to increase, but at levels that make it difficult for all breweries to grow simultaneously," Bart Watson, the Brewers Association's chief economist reported in August. "This is a sign of a maturing market that will likely continue in the coming years."
Other beverages soaring
Meanwhile, the popularity of seltzers, teas and other flavored water products has soared.
David Henkes, a senior principal at Technomic, which tracks restaurant and food service trends, told the New York Times in July that Americans spent about $1.7 billion on sparkling water at restaurants in 2018 while consumers drank $15 billion worth of carbonated soft drinks. But sparkling water is seeing double-digit growth while traditional soda has grown by only 1% each year since 2016.
"You're seeing a massive shift," Henkes told the Times. "Consumers are looking for refreshing alternatives that are 'better for me,' although what 'better for me' means is open to interpretation."
Octopi's growth
The growth for Octopi has been meteoric and could continue if trends hold.
Showaki helped co-found 5 Rabbit Cerveceria in Chicago in 2011 and when he left the brewing company in 2013, he was overseeing contract brewing and was chief operations officer. In 2015, he spent $5 million to open Octopi and equip it with some of the latest brewing technology. However, growth and diversity have meant massive changes.
In the first year of production, One Barrel Brewing Company in Madison accounted for about 40 percent of Octopi's contract business. Now Octopi has 17 international beverage companies with no one client representing more than 8% of business. His clients include Collective Arts Brewing in Canada, One Barrel, Untitled Art, brands for regional supermarket chains and Top Note, a Milwaukee tonic water company that switched production from Pennsylvania to Octopi last spring.
"We're making a statement by moving our production to a brewery," Top Note co-founder Mary Pellettieri said at the time. "We want distributors, retailers and consumers to know that we're shaking things up with our unconventional approach to this category of non-alcoholic beverages."
Octopi's 33,000-squarefoot expansion triples the footprint of the brewery to 50,000 square feet. It includes space for a $2.5 million high-speed canning line that can fill 350, 12-ounce cans a minute compared to 94 cans per minute with the previous system. When at capac-ity, the canning line, comprised of components from KHS USA in Waukesha and Arrowhead Systems in Oshkosh, will be able to handle 600 barrels of product a day, or 8,000 cases a day. The new canning line is also capable of filling a variety of can sizes, including 12-ounce sleek cans, a growing trend for beverage companies, along with 16 ounce and 19.2 ounce cans.
The cellar area for fermenting and storing beverages has doubled to 40 tanks with the addition of 10 200 barrel and five 300 barrel fermentation tanks plus five others of varying sizes. There's a new lab that employs four full time and one part-time employee, a machine shop with a full-time employee and more office, cooler and storage space.
"I never expected to get to 120,000 barrels in four years. It just doesn't happen. It's very rare," Showaki said. "The team is just incredibly talented at doing many different things, which not many co-packers can do."
Building a niche
That level of talent, led by brewmaster Jared Jankoski, who spent time at Goose Island and joined Octopi in February, means that Octopi is able to tackle more complex recipes than other contract beverage firms and assist companies that want to quickly add other products to their portfolio without having to make costly and time-consuming investments in equipment and facilities.
The expansion also includes more food, which for the past year has been relegated to a food truck on the outdoor patio. Now, there's a full-service kitchen and dining room that's open Wednesday through Sunday and led by Jacob Guyette, a chef who worked under award-winning chef Tory Miller in Madison.
In addition, the Octopi beverage facility is now Global Food Safety Initiative certified, an international standard designed to to ensure confidence in the delivery of safer food to consumers, while continuing to improve food safety throughout the supply chain. The standards address food, packaging, packaging materials, storage and distribution for primary producers, manufacturers and distributors, which Showaki believes will bring more business to his operation.
Located on six acres, he also has room for further expansion, something he's already contemplating.
"I have to think about it right now," Showaki said. "The bigger we get, the better we get, the better clients we get, the more capabilities we do. We've built ourselves a little bit of a niche and it's hard for others to compete because we just have so many things to offer." CREDIT: BARRY ADAMS badams@madison.com

Texto completo: "Fight for freedom. Stand with Hong Kong."
Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted that message on Friday. It's a sentiment that should command broad support in the United States, and throughout the free world.
But the reaction from China, which does not number free expression among its cherished values, was swift and painful for the N.B.A. The shoe company Li Ning and the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ended sponsorship deals with the Rockets; Chinese broadcasters said they would not show Rockets games; the Chinese Basketball Association — led by the former Rockets star Yao Ming — suspended ties with the team.
"There is no doubt, the economic impact is already clear," said Adam Silver, the league's commissioner.
Silver went on to add that he supported Morey, but "what I am supporting is his freedom of political expression in this situation."
The billionaires who control the lucrative basketball league, however, nearly tripped over themselves in their haste to abjure Morey's remarks. The N.B.A., like many large American businesses, is besotted by the opportunity to make money in China's expanding market. And the league once again made clear it is willing to obey China's rules to preserve that chance.
The owner of the Rockets, Tilman Fertitta, raced for the traditional refuge of international capitalists — the insistence that business can be segregated from political considerations. "We're here to play basketball and not to offend anybody," Fertitta told ESPN.
But it should be perfectly clear that playing basketball in China is political.
Last year, the N.B.A. staged a game in South Africa for the explicit purpose of celebrating the life of Nelson Mandela. When the N.B.A. goes to China, that's a statement, too.
It means that the N.B.A. has weighed China's human rights abuses against China's potential as a source of revenue, and it has decided that it can live with state policies like the detention of hundreds of thousands of Chinese Muslims in the northwestern province of Xinjiang.
The owner of the Brooklyn Nets, the Chinese billionaire Joe Tsai, took the opportunity to publish an open letter scolding Americans for talking about the affairs of other nations. He also mischaracterized the Hong Kong protests as a "separatist movement."
Tsai's suggestion that people should avoid "third rail" issues may well be good manners when visiting a foreign country, but Morey posted his tweet while visiting Japan — and on a website that is not accessible to the general public in mainland China.
The face of the Rockets, the point guard James Harden, issued a public apology on Monday.
"We apologize," he said.
For what, exactly, remained unclear.
Do the N.B.A.'s owners appreciate that their wealth is a product of the freedoms they enjoy in this country? Does Mr. Harden, the owner of a famous beard, know that Muslims in Xinjiang are not allowed to grow beards like his?
The N.B.A. has an undoubted right to set rules for its work force, but it cannot simultaneously claim to champion free expression — the value of which consists entirely in the right to say what others don't want to hear.
American executives and policymakers initially reconciled themselves to following China's rules by arguing that China's turn toward capitalism, and its exposure to the United States, would gradually lead toward democracy and a greater respect for human rights. They argued, in effect, that silence was the most productive form of criticism.
It should now be clear that silence is merely complicity, no more or less.
It is the moral price the N.B.A. and other businesses are paying for making money in China.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump defended his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani on Saturday amid reports that federal prosecutors are investigating whether the former New York City mayor broke lobbying laws in his efforts to oust a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yavonovitch.
"So now they are after the legendary 'crime buster' and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC, Rudy Giuliani," Mr. Trump tweeted. "He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes, but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer."
Mr. Trump revived one of his recurring conspiracy theories that a "deep state" of entrenched bureaucrats and law enforcement officers is continuing to undermine him and his associates. "Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!" he said.
His vocal defense of the embattled attorney comes just a day after he seemed to put distance between himself and the former mayor when asked if Mr. Giuliani still worked for him. "I don't know. I haven't spoken to Rudy. ... He has been my attorney," the president said.
Following those remarks, Mr. Giuliani told The Washington Post that he was still Mr. Trump's lawyer.
The president's tweet follows a New York Times report that federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating Mr. Giuliani's efforts to have Ms. Yavonovitch recalled in a broader effort to pressure Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
Two of Mr. Giuliani's associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested Wednesday on charges of campaign finance violations. According to an indictment unsealed Thursday, the men were working for Ukrainian officials to remove Ms. Yovanovitch from her job.
Calif. to ban fur sales
California will be the first state to ban the sale and manufacture of new fur products and the third to bar most animals from circus performances under a pair of bills signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.
The fur law bars residents from selling or making clothing, shoes or handbags with fur starting in 2023.
The ban doesn't apply to used products or those used for religious or tribal purposes. And it excludes the sale of leather, dog and cat fur, cowhides, deer, sheep and goat skin, and anything preserved through taxidermy.
California joins New Jersey and Hawaii in banning most animals from circus performances.
The law exempts domesticated dogs, cats and horses and does not apply to rodeos.
Bishop shot in N.H.
PELHAM, N.H. - At least two people were injured in a shooting during a wedding in a church here, including its bishop, police said Saturday.
A shooter arrived at the New England Pentecostal Ministries church at about 10:12 a.m., the Pelham police department said. Guests at the ceremony subdued the alleged attacker by the time police arrived.
There were no fatalities, police said, and the two injured people were taken to hospitals. One of the injured was Bishop Stanley Choate, according to friends and family.
UAW raises strike pay
United Auto Workers said Saturday it's increasing strike pay for workers picketing at General Motors as the walkout by more than 49,000 employees nears the four-week mark.
The union said weekly pay will rise to $275 from $250 for members on strike, effective Sunday. The union also voted to allow members to take part-time jobs and continue to receive strike pay, as long as they perform their picket duty.

Texto completo: Cubans are still living under a patriarchy shaped by the revolution.
HAVANA -- I was six when I saw my mother sitting on a stretcher at a psychiatric hospital in Cienfuegos, half-naked with a blank stare. She was bent over, her hands groping the ground, when a male nurse, humming a popular song, grabbed her hair and forced her to throw up into a bucket, which he then emptied into the toilet.
That image, buried in my memories since the 1970s, resurfaced decades later at the Havana airport. Before a departing flight, an officer in civilian clothing locked me inside a room and, with a smile, asked me to get undressed. I was ordered to squat, and my body was patted down to ensure I was not concealing contraband.
While his fingers searched me, the memory of that nurse's callous laugh and my defenseless mother came back to me like a boomerang, heightening my own sense of vulnerability. What could I do? How and where could I file a complaint? No one talks about what happens in hospitals, nursing homes, women's prisons, police stations and Cuban courts after reports of domestic violence, sexual assault or harassment are filed -- and the public lacks access to any affidavits, statistics or reliable sources that would verify claims. Cuban women must silently endure humiliation in a patriarchal, monolithic and cyclical system.
Six decades after the revolution, women still consider their rights a gift bestowed by the male-led government.
Here is a list of some of the efforts that the revolutionaries made beginning in the 1960s to incorporate "housewives" into socialist society: A national child care system, Círculos Infantiles, was founded. The Facultad Obrera Campesina (F.O.C.) was founded to offer women the opportunity to enroll in secondary education. The Cuban Army made it possible for women to enlist and become military doctors or part of the artillery reserve. Prostitutes were integrated into society and given the opportunity to find jobs as taxi drivers, educators or skilled workers. These policies were devised by government as part of the "battle for women's liberation."
To this day, however, most Cuban women are unaware of what their individual rights are, and few know how dangerous it is to become aware of them. In Cuba, various forms of harassment, abuse and violence against women persist, and there are systems in place for punishing those who do not put down their heads and surrender to the reality that men are in control of our daily lives.
Throughout my life, I've seen how powerless parents are in matters regarding their own children. Parents have no say over how their children should be raised, whether they will be conscripted or sent away to school in rural areas, and what dangers could befall them being so far from home and such a young age. They have no say over their children's manners, religious teachings and political ideologies. There are only two choices: Run with the herd or be crushed by it.
As a teenager in the 1980s, I was taught in a "scientific communism" class that family was the heart of society. But from what I could see, that was no longer the case; organizations with mass followings like the Young Communist League had taken its place.
Things do not improve after leaving school. The intrusive way in which some men treat us, no matter who is present, is plain harassment. In Cuba it is considered normal for you to be shouted at, bossed around, touched without permission, because women are seen as subordinates.
When it came time to choose potential successors for a post-Castro Cuba, not one woman was considered. This was by design. In high school, a teacher and former member of the military once told me, "Men are in command because men made the revolution possible."
The truth is that Cuban women possess great strength and proved their valor on the front lines of the revolution, too.
The guerrilla fighter Celia Sánchez Manduley was one who did. Without her and a small group of female soldiers known as the Marianas, Fidel Castro's victorious march into Havana in 1959 wouldn't have been possible. But because Ms. Sánchez is described in her official biographies as "one of Fidel's closest collaborators," and not as a revolutionary in her own right, many Cuban girls are unaware of her achievements.
She opposed executions by firing squad and the forced-labor camps where Mr. Castro sent gay men and other so-called counter-revolutionaries. Despite her role in the revolution, Ms. Sánchez was never granted the title of "comandante." She also was an outspoken woman who, surrounded by a male-dominated military, was not able to carry out her own objectives.
Today, being a woman in Cuba who is unwilling to keep silent is complicated. We are also policed by other women: Family, friends, neighbors and colleagues can all be enlisted to report on, betray and bad-mouth us. This ends up hurting all of us.
While the #MeToo movement has reached countries around the world, Cubans are still living under a patriarchy shaped by the revolution. Cuban men don't see a problem, and convincing them otherwise is futile, because for generations they've been taught that women were liberated 60 years ago during the revolution and that we require nothing more. Doing anything that doesn't benefit the state makes you suspicious.
That was my mother's experience, and it's why her writing was not published until after her death. And the same is true for me: I am not allowed to publish works in my own country that describe Cuba's stark reality.
I cannot recall a time when Cuba came close to abolishing the social ailments that have afflicted us. In our history, we've confronted imperialist threats, the American economic embargo and various foreign policy emergencies, but addressing basic issues of women's rights has always been an inconvenient task. The feeling of being under constant threat kept us silent, gritting our teeth and accepting our place.
But it's time to impartially and independently discuss the particular needs of women, separate and independent from the government's agenda -- bearing in mind, always, that the forces necessary to bring about a transformation are still invested in the prevailing image of the male authoritarian clad in military green. In Cuba, endemic sexism is politically correct.
Any public discourse about the plight of Cuban women must encompass legal reform and bring forward cases of abuse, no matter which entity or person is responsible, enabling us to claim rights that are normal elsewhere. Among these are the right to a clean hospital room with running water to give birth in, and pension payments that are in line with market prices for divorced mothers with children, and freedom from psychological and physical abuse, whether personal, state or ideological.
I was born and raised in a system that exerts control under the guise of paternalism -- a system that caresses you as it beats you, that teaches you but also inhibits you, enlightens you and censures you. We are hostages to a government that behaves like an abusive, old-fashioned and sexist father, from whom we must seek consent and forgiveness.

Heirs of omission: Who’s in, and not in, a will

Texto completo: These past few weeks we’ve been discussing “omissions” (you can decide whether these are errors or sins). As an estate planning attorney, I instantly think of “omitted heirs.” And you may think, “huh?”
An omitted heir is a person who would have inherited by law but was not mentioned in a will or trust. A related concept is “pretermitted heir”– someone who was born to, adopted by, or married to the deceased after the date of the will. Both situations have legal consequences, which may or may not have been intended.
Occasionally, I meet with a client who intends to disinherit a child. We always state that clearly and upfront in the will with a statement such as “I have intentionally not provided for my child Badly Behaving Bob and for all purposes hereunder he is to be treated as having predeceased me,” and sometimes we add “leaving no issue” if the client also wishes to disinherit any of Bob’s children (and let’s face it, if the behavior was bad enough those grandchildren could be sprinkled across the globe). This can make clients uncomfortable. But there is a reason for it.
California law
California provides that in the case of an omitted or pretermitted heir the heir will inherit an intestate share (what they would have received had there been no will at all) except in some specific circumstances. In other words, the law assumes you mean to provide for your children, with only a few exceptions, which are:
* The decedent’s failure to provide for the child was intentional and that intention appears from the testamentary instruments.
* The decedent had one or more children and devised or otherwise directed the disposition of substantially all the estate to the other parent of the omitted child.
* The decedent provided for the child by transfer outside of the estate, and the intention that the transfer be in lieu of a provision in said instruments is shown by statements of the decedent or by other evidence.
California law also provides that if at the time the decedent executed the estate plan they failed to provide for a child solely because they were unaware of the child or believed the child was deceased, the child will be entitled to take a share of the decedent’s estate.
Thus, documenting your wishes and intentions becomes important in these situations. And disclosing to your attorney any children, stepchildren, adopted children, or possible children you may have is also extremely important.
Celebrity omissions
Remember when actor Heath Ledger died, leaving behind 2-year-old Matilda, his daughter with Michelle Williams? Ledger’s will pre-dated Matilda’s birth by several years and left everything to his sisters and parents.
His will was signed when his assets were estimated at just above $100,000. When he died, his net worth was said to be more than $16 million. Luckily for Matilda, Ledger’s family agreed to give it all to her and no court battle ensued. Ledger was an Australian citizen; in California, the pretermitted heir law would have given the estate to Matilda anyway, but with a greedier family, a long court battle would have likely ensued.
The family of Michael Crichton, creator of Jurassic Park and ER, was not so lucky. At the time of his death in 2008, he was 66 years old and left behind four ex-wives, a 20-year-old daughter, and a new wife who was six months pregnant.
Crichton executed a will and trust in 2007 and specifically stated, “I have intentionally made no provision in this will for any of my heirs or relatives who are not herein mentioned or designated, and I hereby generally and specifically disinherit every person claiming to be or who may be determined to be my heir-at-law, except as otherwise mentioned in this will.”
If Crichton had updated his estate plan when he learned his wife was expecting, a protracted battle between his daughter (who thought that provision should apply to disinherit her half-brother) and the mother of his son (who had a prenup but fought on behalf of her son) could have been avoided. The court eventually ruled that Crichton’s son was entitled to one-third of his estate as a pretermitted heir since his son was not conceived or known of at the time the will was executed.
Crichton’s $100 million art collection soon went to auction at Christie’s to begin making distributions (and paying legal fees, no doubt).
When is a child not a child?
It is equally important to name those who may not be considered “children” by law. It’s not uncommon for a child to take the last name of a stepfather so that mom, stepdad and child all had the same name and to the world at large they were a family. This is particularly true if biological dad is not part of the child’s life.
But if stepdad did not legally adopt the child, the child will not be a legal heir. The stepdad would need to specifically state that he intended to treat the child as his own.
You forgot you were married?
The laws are similar for omitted spouses. When a testamentary document is executed before a marriage and does not mention the spouse, the surviving spouse will be considered a pretermitted heir entitled to all the community property and a share of separate property.
No contest
If you do intend to disinherit a child or a spouse, you will need to carefully state as much in clear language in your will or trust.
In some circumstances, however, you may want to consider a gift to that person instead. I know that sounds nuts, but hear me out. Most folks are aware of the “no-contest” provisions in testamentary documents — that’s the clause that says “if anyone contests this document, they inherit nothing.”
If you’ve completely disinherited someone, they have nothing to lose by contesting your plan. Instead, if you’ve given them a gift at least they have the loss of that gift to consider.
Let me not omit the best advice of all — implement and regularly review your estate plan.

Texto completo: The Ukrainian scandal that has threatened Donald Trump's presidency snaked its way to Palm Beach County when a Boca Raton man and his business partner were arrested Wednesday night on campaign finance law violations as they prepared to board a Frankfurt-bound plane with one-way tickets at a Washington-area airport.
Lev Parnas, of Boca Raton, who was born in Ukraine, and Igor Fruman, of Sunny Isles Beach, who was born in Belarus, are among four men indicted by a grand jury in New York on charges of conspiring to "circumvent federal laws against foreign influence” to “buy potential influence with candidates, campaigns, and the candidates' governments."
The indictment alleges that Parnas and Fruman, who were subpoenaed Thursday to testify in the Trump impeachment scandal before Congress, formed a company called Global Energy Producers and, with money from foreign nationals, made large contributions in that firm's name to state and federal candidates in Florida, Nevada, New York and other states.
A West Palm Beach businessman, David Correia, and a fourth man, Andrey Kukushkin, also were indicted. Prosecutors say they helped mask the source of Global Energy Producers’ money.
Attempts to reach Correia, who had not been arrested Thursday, were unsuccessful.
Court documents and Florida campaign finance records indicate Global Energy Producers contributed $325,000 to a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action.
Trump said Thursday he didn’t know the men, adding that while he may have a photo with Parnas, "I have pictures with everybody."
"You'll have to ask Rudy," Trump said about the two, referring to his personal lawyer, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
Global Energy also gave money to prominent Florida Republicans, including $50,000 to Gov. Ron DeSantis’ campaign as he ran against Democrat Andrew Gillum.
Fruman gave $20,400 to Sen. Rick Scott’s campaign in May 2018 and Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Mast’s campaign got about $2,400. Records show Fruman’s name was misspelled as Igor Furman, a point made in the indictment.
DeSantis’ spokeswoman, Helen Ferre, said the governor is giving away the money Global Energy Producers donated.
“The allegations regarding Global Energy Producers to the governor’s affiliated political action committee in 2018 are troubling,” Ferre said. “Therefore, Governor DeSantis is directing the political action committee to return the money to the federal government.”
Earlier Thursday, Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Terrie Rizzo urged the governor to donate the money to charity. "The stench of Governor Ron DeSantis' dirty money grows more foul with each passing day," Rizzo said in a statement.
U.S. Rep. Lois Frankel, D-West Palm Beach, said the indictments strengthen her party’s impeachment push.
“This just adds to the evidence of the shakedown of the Ukrainian president by Trump and the apparent corrupt activities of Rudy Giuliani and his associates,” Frankel said in a statement.
Trump is not mentioned in the indictment unsealed Thursday, but Parnas and Fruman are reported to have worked with Giuliani to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, who could end up as Trump's Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election.
Parnas and Fruman are represented by John Dowd, an attorney who until March 2018 served as a legal adviser to Trump.
The president’s efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Biden and his son, Hunter, sparked an impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House.
Hunter Biden sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that was, for a time, under investigation in Ukraine. His father, while vice president, joined other Western political leaders in urging Ukraine to remove the prosecutor who oversaw the investigation.
Federal prosecutors allege that Parnas and Fruman were involved in an effort to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch. She was recalled in spring, an action the House is investigating.
Parnas and Fruman promised to raise money for then-Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, identified as “Congressman-1” in the indictment, The New York Times reported. The men asked Sessions, who then was the chairman of the House Rules Committee, for his help in removing Yovanovitch, according to the indictment.
With the arrest of Parnas and Fruman, the president faces the prospect that the men could make a deal with federal investigators in which, in exchange for leniency, they would provide information that could bolster the Democrats' push for impeachment.
The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. Attorney General William Barr has been briefed on the case and is supportive of it.
The men could make a deal with prosecutors that imperils Giuliani, who has aggressively sought to assist the president's efforts to get the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens.
It is also possible, however, that Barr, a staunch backer of the president, could slow the case or snuff it out altogether.
The case is being handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan, which has exercised some independence during the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, Giuliani, who has joined in speculation that a “deep state” cabal of officials within the U.S. government are out to get Trump, told Fox News that he found the arrest of Parnas and Fruman “extremely suspect.”
Already, the case is adding a wing to the house of scandal in which Trump finds himself living. However, his supporters say it doesn’t touch the president.
CNN reported that Jay Sekulow, also a personal attorney for Trump, said the indictment has nothing to do with the president or his reelection campaign.
“Read the indictment,” the network quoted Sekulow as saying. “Neither the candidate nor the campaign have anything to do with the scheme these guys were involved in.”
The $325,000 donation to the Trump PAC, America First Action, came on May 17, 2018, from Global Energy Producers. Prosecutors say GEP got the money from an unidentified lender.
At the same time, Palm Beach County Circuit Court documents indicate that the Pues Family Trust of New York has been pursuing a $510,435 judgment against Lev Parnas and Parnas Holdings.
The trust successfully sued Parnas for failure to repay a 2011 loan of $350,000. Parnas was ordered to repay the money with interest.
In November 2018, the trust questioned whether Parnas’ company had the money to do so.
"It should be noted that the prominent news articles referenced above involve GEP donating over $300,000 to the American First Super PAC very soon after incorporation of the entity in April of 2018," the document states. "It is extremely likely that Lev Parnas is the direct source of these funds."
The document indicates that Pues Family Trust issued a subpoena to GEP as part of its effort to get the $510,435 from Parnas, "who has not made any attempts whatsoever at paying or even negotiating settlement of the final judgment."
Reached by The Palm Beach Post on Thursday, Tony Andre, an Aventura attorney for the trust, said Parnas' indictment was a surprise.
"I was unaware that he was under any federal investigation," Andre said. "Like everybody else, we're waiting to see how this plays out."
Andre said his client is still trying to collect the judgment from Parnas.
"It remains wholly outstanding," Andre said.
A July 2018 Federal Election Commission complaint against Global Energy Producers and Fruman and Parnas details connections between the men and Trump, including a picture showing Fruman offering a thumbs up as he stands next to a smiling Trump.
The complaint quotes from a Russian news article "describing how a businessman named Igor Fruman participated in an event for President Trump's campaign on March 3, 2018, at President Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida."
The complaint includes Fruman's quotes from the Russian article.
"In the 2016 elections, I made donations to Trump's election campaign fund, and now, a year after taking over the presidency, Trump decided it was right again to invite us and turn to his supporters," Fruman is quoted as saying. "To date, President Trump is a man who has collected the best ideas for the development of the country and the settlement of international conflicts. The meeting in Mar-a-Lago was the start of his campaign in the 2020 elections. Donald Trump clearly told us that he is going for a second term and intends to win it."

Emissions tests needed in Florida

Having moved here to the Tampa Bay area recently, I do not understand why the state does not require annual inspections of autos for both emissions and safety. Fifteen states have a periodic (annual or biennial) safety inspection program, while Maryland and Alabama require a safety inspection on sale or transfer of vehicles that were previously registered in another state. Included in this group are the largest states population-wise that contribute to high carbon dioxide emissions. Florida, the third-largest state, has no such program. It certainly seems short sighted by the state government not to initiate these auto inspections. Transportation is the largest source of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the United States today and the bulk of those emissions come from driving in our cities and suburbs.

According to a New York Times analysis, the Tampa Bay area has seen a 55 percent increase in total emissions since 1990. The other large metro areas of Florida have seen like increases. Vehicles pollute more as they age and add to the carbon dioxide levels. Repairing high-polluting vehicles will help lower the carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, safety inspections of brakes, tires and lights will help reduce accidents. Florida is the undisputed leader by far in vehicle accidents. Having a yearly emissions and safety check mandatory would help make Florida a safer place to drive and breathe in.

Leave no one behind

Our American armed forces involved in combat operations have a heroic code of honor that they will leave no one behind. This call to brave and honorable acts does not apply just to their American fellow combatants but to their allies who have been fighting shoulder-to-shoulder with them against their common enemy. Now, in a most egregious violation of this code of honor, the current commander-in-chief is leaving our fellow Kurdish allies behind. It was the Kurds, with limited assistance from U.S. forces, who defeated ISIS, a fact known among our forces that fought with them. This absurdly wrong decision belittles our reputation as a nation that will come to the aid of our friends and allies in times of need. It is time for him to go and to restore honor to the position of commander-in-chief.

Diversitys gray area

The last sentence in this editorial summarizes the Times position: Gov. Ron Desantis should do the right thing and appoint at least one black justice. Id like to better understand exactly what that means. If the nominee has one black parent and one white parent, à la President Barack Obama, is that acceptable? What about one-fourth black like my son, whose grandfather was a Jamaican immigrant? What about a person who immigrated from Africa and speaks with a British accent  in other words black, but not African-American? What about a black nominee with conservative/originalist leanings à la Justice Clarence Thomas? Ive heard repeatedly from the left that he isnt authentically black. Its all so confusing. Its sad that in the most racially accepting and diverse country in the world, were still having these pointless tribal discussions.

David Brooks: What makes us all radically equal

Texto completo: Around New Year’s 2017, a community organizer named Chris Lambert leased a soon-to-be-empty school building for $1 in one of Detroit’s poorer African American neighborhoods. The plan was to pour $5 million into remodeling the building, take on the $1-million-a-year operating expenses and turn the place into a vibrant hub for the surrounding community, with nonprofits, culinary training programs, after-school programs and artists.
Lambert did not communicate this well to the people who actually lived in the community.
When neighbors learned Lambert had acquired the building for a dollar, many wondered why a white outsider, not somebody from within the community, had gotten such a deal. They assumed that he was the cutting edge of gentrification, that he was going to pour money in and push the current folks out. This kind of outsider exploitation is the lived history for many Detroiters.
That month, Lambert hosted some community meetings to mollify fears. They did not go well. People called him a colonizer. They called his black colleagues Oreos. “This white guy is going to subject us to more slavery,” somebody declared.
Lambert wanted to argue back. But his black partner, Dwan Dandridge, advised him to just listen. It’s a hazing process, Dandridge told Lambert. You feel voiceless tonight. These people have felt voiceless their whole lives. Just listen.
This fullest account of the episode can be found in Bittersweet Monthly in an article written by Anne Snyder, my wife. I visited Lambert and Dandridge in Detroit a few weeks ago, a year and a half after the grand opening.
The building, now called the Durfee Innovation Society, has children teeming the halls, a pizzeria, training programs, yoga classes. Lambert is humbled by the mistakes he made, but his center is fantastic. Some of his angriest critics have now taken part in neighborhood festivities held in the building. There is still distrust, suspicion, rage at injustice coursing through the neighborhood. But there is also life together, happening every day.
I see these messy clash-ups across the country, wherever people are trying to do racial reconciliation. You realize that coming together across race is not a neat two-step process: truth and reconciliation. It’s an emotionally complex, thousand-step process, with moments of miscommunication, resentment and embrace. This is the hard process of trying to see each other across centuries of wrong.
The somewhat comforting truth is that it’s always been like this. When you read David Blight’s brilliant biography of Frederick Douglass, for example, you see that Douglass passed through exactly these many moods in dealing with his countrymen of another race — moments of fury and harmony, despair and hope.
Sometimes he was disgusted with America. “I have no love for America, as such,” he once said. Other times he was enraptured: “I am an American citizen. In birth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations and responsibilities.”
Douglass’ genius was his ability to balance his indignation at oppression with his underlying faith in the American project. In his speeches he would praise his white audiences in one movement and thunder condemnation in the next. In an 1876 speech about Abraham Lincoln, he both condemned and complimented the man who inspired and infuriated him: “Viewed from the genuine abolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull and indifferent; but measuring him from the sentiment of his country ... he was swift, zealous, radical and determined.”
Douglass could withstand all the ups and downs, all the ambivalences, because of an unchanging underlying belief: in the natural rights of all humankind.
He constantly returned to the core belief of America’s founding in 1776, that we are endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights. Slavery and racism were not just wrong — they betrayed the divine natural order of the universe. Douglass had an underlying faith in the providence. Justice would eventually triumph. The “laws which govern the moral universe,” he said, would make it so.
And here we get to the nub of what sustained Douglass and what sustains people today as they do this work. It is the belief that all humans have souls. It is the belief that all people of all races have a piece of themselves that has no size, weight, color or shape, but which gives them infinite value and dignity.
It is the belief that our souls make us all radically equal. Our brains and bodies are not equal, but our souls are. It is the belief that the person who is infuriating you most right now still has a soul and so is still, deep down, beautiful and redeemable. It is the belief that when all is said and done all souls have a common home together, a final resting place as pieces of a larger unity.
When people hold fast to their awareness of souls, then they have a fixed center among the messiness of racial reconciliation, and they give each other grace. If they lose the concept of the soul, they’ve lost everything.

Texto completo: Regulators appear poised to cave to the tech industry. What's the rush?
A mother can't clean her kitchen because her toddler's next YouTube video won't automatically play. A Native American language instructor won't be able to monetize her Navajo language teaching channel. Online videos will be riddled with ads that have nothing to do with your interests.
That's the supposedly ominous future that critics in the technology industry paint for American life online if the Federal Trade Commission doesn't weaken -- ahem, "update" -- the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, as it applies to education technology, platforms that host child-focused content and the voice-assisted devices that are flooding into homes today.
The commissioners have an unusual opportunity, though. Rather than ratcheting back one of the nation's only federal privacy laws, they could instead choose to study the issue in greater depth and ultimately make privacy protections stronger.
Signed into law more than two decades ago, the law, known as COPPA, seeks to ensure that children under the age of 13 cannot share private information, be targeted by advertising or have their data collected online without their parents' consent. It was updated in 2013 to include protections against tracking children with cookies, the persistent identifiers that track users' activity online, often for advertising purposes.
This week, the F.T.C. hosted a public workshop, "The Future of the COPPA Rule," to discuss changes to -- and most likely, the weakening of -- the act. The focus of the event, attended by many industry advocates, was about how evolving business practices in the tech industry affect children's privacy on social media, wireless devices and general audience sites.
That focus is important, as more and more products that are not intended for children have become destinations for young people online, while some websites with child-oriented content attempt to dodge compliance with the privacy regulations. One of the major issues under consideration is whether the commission should make special exceptions for education technology and voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home. In her opening statement on Monday, Christine Wilson, an F.T.C. commissioner, offered a pre-emptive defense of the commission's willingness to entertain changes, claiming that the purpose of the rule review was not to roll back protections, but rather to ensure that the law continued to serve the goals set by Congress when it passed the legislation.
The F.T.C. has no legal obligation to update the act this year, as its next compulsory review is not scheduled until 2023. The agency says the reason for the early review is that technology has changed greatly in the past few years.
Yet Americans' attitudes toward privacy have changed sharply, too. Rather than bow to industry pressure, the commission is in a strong position to use its authority to compel the tech industry to share more about its business practices toward children, to better inform both public discussion and its own regulatory efforts.
Concern about the commission relaxing the law's privacy provisions has led to a rare moment of bipartisan cooperation: Two Democratic senators, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, have joined two Republican senators, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, in calling on the commission to hit the brakes. In an interview, Mr. Hawley said about the practice of targeting ads to children based on their previous online behavior, "I'm concerned about some of the comments that F.T.C. officials have made where they seem to suggest that behavioral-targeted advertising is a good thing." He added, "I mean, that sounds frankly crazy to me."
One such official is Andrew Smith, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, who has echoed industry talking points about how increased privacy protections could hurt the internet experience. He went off script at a Better Business Bureau conference last month to say that if creators are unable to monetize their content with behaviorally targeted ads (to which children are particularly vulnerable), YouTube would become "a desert of crap." That prompted privacy advocates to call for his recusal from rule-making on the issue.

The senators are concerned about the commission's spotty record of enforcing compliance with COPPA, and warned in their letter to the commissioners that the "F.T.C. is at risk of favoring the interests of giant tech companies over the interests of parents and children."
Mr. Hawley and Mr. Markey have co-sponsored a legislative update to COPPA that includes an "Eraser Button" that would give parents the power to delete their children's data. It also would raise the age covered by the law to 15 from 12, as well as tighten the requirement that a website seek parental consent to collect information if it has reason to believe a viewer is a child. The current standard is looser, and companies like Google and its subsidiary YouTube have abused it, knowingly targeting children for advertising.
Just last month, the commission fined Google and YouTube $ 170 million for violating the children's privacy law by harvesting children's personal data and using it to target them for ads using cookies. While it was by far the F.T.C.'s largest privacy fine leveled to date, it was a small sum for such flagrant violations. In Mr. Hawley's opinion, "The F.T.C. has just, in the last two months, gone very easy on YouTube and Google over blatant and widespread violations of COPPA."
The Markey-Hawley bill would give the commission clear direction on how to enforce the law, limiting the power of industry lobbyists and lawyers to influence agency decisions.
Hope is fading for comprehensive federal online privacy legislation this year, which is all the more reason that the one federal statute designed to protect children's digital privacy should be strengthened, or at least left alone. As Mr. Markey put it this summer, "if the commission is truly serious about protecting young people online, it will enforce existing protections."
Silicon Valley prides itself on moving fast and breaking things. It's time for those who oversee privacy protections to slow down and think hard about what rolling back this foundational law would mean for children.

Texto completo: U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker will "absolutely and immediately" return campaign contributions sent to him during the 2018 election cycle by a South Florida businessman who allegedly circumvented Federal Elections Commission rules to contribute foreign money and influence into state and federal elections.
Igor Fruman contributed approximately $2,500 to Smucker’s campaign in two contributions -- one totaling $260 on May 14, 2018 and another on June 12, 2018 totaling $2,174. Fruman contributed under the alias “Igor Furman,” according to FEC filings, which is against campaign finance regulations.
"Under no circumstances does Smucker for Congress knowingly accept improper campaign contributions," the Smucker campaign said in a statement, adding that the contribution came to the campaign unsolicited through a joint fundraising committee. Smucker never met with Fruman or his associates, the campaign added.
Fruman and his business partner Lev Parnas were arrested on campaign finance charges at Dulles International Airport in Alexandria, Virginia, Thursday with one-way international tickets, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York announced today in a press conference. Two others were indicted as part of this investigation.
Fruman and Parnas helped Rudy Giuliani’s efforts to investigate Hunter Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden’s son, the New York Times reported. Both businessmen are U.S. citizens but foreign born; Parnas was born in Ukraine and Fruman was born in Belarus, according to the indictment.
Giuliani has come under fire for his work as President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer and his attempts to pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens for Trump’s alleged political gain.
The federal indictment alleges Parnas and Fruman “began attending political fundraising events in connection with federal actions and making substantial contributions to candidates, joint fundraising committees and independent expenditure committees with the purpose of enhancing their influence in political circles and gaining access to politicians.”
Fruman also contributed approximately the same amount of money to U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, PA-01. Fruman sent almost identical contributions to both Smucker and Fitzpatrick’s congressional campaigns on June 12, 2018, along with a $50,000 contribution to Protect the House, a joint fundraising committee for state Republican parties and candidates.
Fitzpatrick's campaign wrote in an email the contribution will be "immediately donated to charity."
"With this and any other instance where an unsolicited contribution from an unknown donor is made, and wrongdoing is discovered, the money is instantly donated to charity," the Fitzpatrick campaign said.
Fruman and Parnas also created a limited liability corporation named Global Energy Producers to “intentionally” contribute to campaigns in the LLC’s name, instead of their own in an effort to exceed federal maximum contribution limits.
Another congressman, U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, announced he will immediately return the $5,400 in contributions he received from the indicted businessmen, the Post and Courier reported.

Turkey takes a page out of Russian playbook; threatens to weaponize refugees

Texto completo: Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned Thursday he would flood Europe with millions of Syrian refugees if European countries condemn the invasion of northern Syria.
"We will open the gates and send 3.6 million refugees your way," Erdoğan said in a speech to members of his Justice and Development political party.
The threat comes straight out of the Russian playbook. Russia and its ally, Syrian President Bashar Assad, spurred waves of refugees into Europe in 2015 after attacking civilian populations in Syria. The operations were meant to destabilize Europe, said the former NATO supreme allied commander, Gen. Philip Breedlove.
"Together, Russia and the Assad regime are deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve," Breedlove told the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2016.
Assad's use of barrel bombs and Russia's use of unguided munitions prove that the regimes intended to cause mass migration into Europe, Breedlove said.
"These indiscriminate weapons used by both Bashar al-Assad, and the non-precision use of weapons by the Russian forces — I can't find any other reason for them other than to cause refugees to be on the move and make them someone else's problem," Breedlove said.
Turkey, which borders Syria to the north, "Hosts the largest number of refugees worldwide," according to the United Nations. Millions of refugees passed through Turkey's northwest border with Greece and Bulgaria on their way into Europe, creating political turmoil in several countries. In recent weeks, Turkey has forced thousands out of major cities, according to a report by the New York Times.
In September, Erdoğan threatened to "open the gates" to allow Syrian refugees into Europe unless a "safe zone" was established along Turkey's border with Syria.
Despite being a member of NATO, Turkey has drifted toward the Kremlin's sphere of influence in recent years. Turkey's decision to purchase S-400 air defense systems from Russia rankled the United States and prompted President Trump to boot Turkey out of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

Tourism websites get moralistic

Texto completo: A few years ago, vacationing families driving down Interstate 75 toward Orlando could see, among signs for gas stations and Waffle House, a billboard with a message.
Waiting just ahead of the Florida Turnpike, it read, "FREE WORLD NOT SLAVEWORLD: END WHALE CAPTIVITY." The phrase is strange, as if it's supposed to rhyme. But it makes some sense when you realize "SLAVEWORLD" is a substitute for "SeaWorld."
"I still cannot believe whales and dolphins are being kept for performing circuses," said Jan Pettifor, the woman who put up the billboard for the Dolphin Project. "Dolphins and whales belong in one place — the ocean."
Animal rights groups have long targeted SeaWorld for raising whales and dolphins in captivity. They have a new ally now: the travel website TripAdvisor.
The self-described world's largest travel platform has an animal-welfare platform, and the site has decided that it requires a SeaWorld ban. TripAdvisor will no longer be selling tickets to venues such as SeaWorld and the Georgia Aquarium, targeting attractions that breed or import cetaceans such as whales, dolphins, and porpoises.
"Whales and dolphins do not thrive in limited captive environments, and we hope to see a future where they live as they should — free and in the wild," TripAdvisor's president for experiences and rentals, Dermot Halpin, told the New York Times.
SeaWorld stopped breeding orcas a couple of years ago in response to protests and exposés, including the 2013 documentary Blackfish, which documented the death of a SeaWorld trainer after a killer whale dragged her underwater. But that incident was almost a decade ago, and SeaWorld says it has changed.
"We are disappointed by TripAdvisor's new position that ignores the educational value and conservation mission of professionally accredited zoos and aquariums," said Chris Dold, Seaworld's chief zoological officer. "SeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals, including cetaceans."
SeaWorld may continue to amend its practices, but for some of the animal rights activists targeting tourists, the protests won't end until whales and dolphins are all back in the sea.

Overlooked No More: Mitsuye Endo, a name linked to justice for Japanese Americans and who was interned in Utah

Texto completo: Overlooked is a series of obituaries about remarkable people whose deaths, beginning in 1851, went unreported in The New York Times.
It was January 1942, and Japanese American civil servants in California were alarmed. Within weeks of Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, the state government had sent an invasive questionnaire to its employees of Japanese descent.
Did they speak Japanese? Had they ever visited Japan? Were they members of any Japanese organizations?
Anti-Japanese sentiment was high, and the survey, with its accusatory tone, seemed bent on portraying workers as untrustworthy.
Mitsuye Endo, a 22-year-old typist with the Department of Motor Vehicles, dutifully answered the questions, and that spring she was fired, along with dozens of other Nisei, or second-generation Japanese Americans, who worked for the state.
Although born in the United States, Nisei were accused of holding Japanese citizenship as well, a sign to many Americans of potential disloyalty. Their attending Buddhist schools and their ability to read and write Japanese only raised suspicions further.
“We were given a piece of paper saying we were suspended because we were of Japanese ancestry,” Endo said in the only interview she ever gave, to John Tateishi, for his book “And Justice for All: An Oral History of the Japanese American Detention Camps” (1984).
By then President Franklin Roosevelt had signed Executive Order 9066, ordering the internment of about 120,000 Japanese Americans in camps throughout the country.
Endo, who was interned with her family, would go on to become the chief plaintiff in the only U.S. Supreme Court case to successfully challenge Japanese incarceration during World War II. Three similar Supreme Court cases failed, most notably Korematsu v. United States, in which the justices upheld the restrictions placed on Japanese Americans.
In Endo’s case — ex parte Mitsuye Endo — the court unanimously ruled on Dec. 18, 1944, that the government could not detain citizens who were loyal to the United States.
Yet Endo, an unassuming woman, would never seek the spotlight, and by the time of the ruling she had never set foot in court.
Mitsuye Maureen Endo was born on May 10, 1920, in Sacramento, the second of four children of Jinshiro and Shima (Ota) Endo, Japanese immigrants. Her father was a salesman in a grocery store, her mother a homemaker. In the 1940s, the family lived and worked in one of the country’s largest and most vibrant Japantowns, a section of Sacramento with 3,400 residents and hundreds of businesses.
After the forced evacuation of Japanese Americans, the Japanese American Citizens League, a national group, hired James Purcell, a San Francisco lawyer, to put together a case that would challenge the government and shutter the 10 detention camps it had opened. In looking for the ideal plaintiff to represent the group, he distributed a questionnaire to internees. In a stack of 100 or so responses, one stood out.
Endo had never visited Japan, had attended a Sacramento public school and was a Methodist. To top it off, her brother had served in the Army. On paper, she was perfect.
“They felt I represented a symbolic, ‘loyal’ American,” she said in “And Justice for All.”
The Endo family had been moved to a temporary relocation facility near Sacramento, then 300 miles north to the remote Tule Lake Segregation Center, near the Oregon border.
On July 13, 1942, Purcell filed a writ of habeas corpus, arguing, “If you can abrogate certain sections of the Constitution and incarcerate any person without trial or charges just because you do not like his nationality, what is to prevent from abrogating any or all of the Constitution?”
It took a year before Judge Michael Roche of the U.S. District Court in Northern California denied Endo’s freedom. The government, expecting Purcell would file an appeal, offered her release, but on one condition: She was not to return home.
“The top lawyer for the War Relocation Authority met with her in camp to offer her freedom in exchange for a commitment not to try to return to the forbidden area of the West Coast,” Eric Muller, a law professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said by email. “She refused the offer.”
Some of her friends and relatives accepted the offer and were released, but Endo remained incarcerated indefinitely while her case remained under appeal.
By this time, her immediate family had been transferred to the Central Utah Relocation Center in Topaz, about 140 miles southwest of Salt Lake City. They made do with meager food rations — “they gave them just any old thing — scraps here and there,” Endo’s daughter Terry DeRivera said in an interview — and Endo sometimes became ill. She remembered armed soldiers in towers watching them from on high.
“She was really afraid,” DeRivera said .
During her detainment Endo met her future husband, Kenneth Tsutsumi, who played the ukulele with friends to pass the time and entertain fellow detainees.
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in her case in October 1944. That December it ruled unanimously in Endo’s favor, calling her a “concedingly loyal” citizen.
The ruling said the government had no legal right to confine people who had been screened and found to be loyal, but though it referred to the detention of Japanese Americans as “racial discrimination,” it stopped short of defining the constitutional limits of wartime detention based on factors like race.
As Muller put it in his email, “It didn’t want, on the one hand, to approve of racial detentions, or, on the other, to hand President Roosevelt a defeat during wartime.”
In fact, the day before the court issued its ruling , the Roosevelt administration announced that Japanese Americans could return home beginning on Jan. 1, 1945. Besides effectively closing the remaining concentration camps (though it took until the end of the year before they were entirely emptied), the Endo case has continued to be cited in matters related to the detention of U.S. citizens.
It was invoked in 2004, for example, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, a Supreme Court case that ruled that U.S. citizens who were detained as enemy combatants were entitled to due process and could not be barred from challenging their enemy combatant status.
Despite the Supreme Court ruling citing discrimination, anti-Japanese sentiment remained pervasive on the West Coast.
“It was not a good thing,” Endo’s daughter said. “It was a nightmare for them.”
During the war a Senate committee on Japanese resettlement released a report saying that there would be “violence and bloodshed” if internees were returned to the West Coast. It appealed to Roosevelt to keep them out of California until the end of the war.
Despite her earlier insistence on returning home, Endo decided that it wouldn’t be safe to do so. “My mom said no, she would never go back to California,” DeRivera said.
Endo and Tsutsumi moved to Chicago, where they married on Nov. 22, 1946. They raised three children in a close-knit community of Japanese American transplants. Endo rarely spoke of the past and strove to fit in “like American apple pie,” DeRivera said.
Endo died of cancer on April 14, 2006. She was 85.
Later in life, when she was interviewed for “And Justice for All,” she marveled at how her incarceration and the subsequent court case “seemed like a dream” to her so many years later.
“When I think about it now — that my case went to the Supreme Court — I’m awed by it,” she said. “I never believed it, that I would be the one.”

Texto completo: The assistant principal of Salisbury High School was telling an audience about the school's efforts to warn students about the dangers of vaping when several parents interjected.
"We need it in middle school," one parent said.
"It's on the bus. Middle school. It's on the buses," another said.
"They're doing it on the bus!" one parent shouted.
Vaping horror stories typically are told in two pictures: the first is a glamorous Instagram photo of a high school or college student showing off a colorful smoke cloud from a sleek vape pen, and the second is that same person unconscious on a hospital bed and hooked up to medical machinery.
The people who really need to see those pictures are middle school students, said parents at a Sept. 26 community forum on vaping held at Salisbury High hosted by St. Luke's University Health Network. School administrators and parents say kids are starting to vape as young as middle school. They like the flavors and flashy technology and see their peers vaping.
"Unfortunately, if one or two cool kids do it, it doesn't take long for other kids to follow," said Kathleen Halkins, supervisor of health services at Bethlehem Area School District.
Health officials have been warning the public against the possible long-term health effects of e-cigarette use, but an escalating number of serious lung injuries the past year among young people has spurred action from policy makers and doctors across the country, including in the Lehigh Valley.
Nearly 1,100 mysterious vaping injuries have been reported across the country, including 18 deaths in 15 states, according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most patients said they have a history of using THC products, according to the agency.
Lehigh Valley Health Network has treated two young men with suspected vaping injuries, spokesman Brian Downs said.
As of last month, St. Luke's University Health Network had treated about half-dozen suspected cases of vaping-related lung injuries in young adults in recent months.
The patients typically are young adults. Dr. Douglas Corwin, a pulmonologist from St. Luke's told the audience at Salisbury High that he's treated a 17-year-old, an 18-year-old and a 21-year-old. One had asthma and the other two were healthy, he said.
"These aren't chronically ill people, these aren't people on a bunch of medications. These aren't your weak and feeble people," Corwin said.
Doctors and scientists have not identified a chemical or product causing the injuries, but state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said illegally sold vape pens are causing the majority of these vaping injuries.
The injuries are on the rise as the popularity of e-cigarettes has surged among teens and young adults. Like tobacco, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to buy vape pens, which have nicotine. Juul, the biggest seller of e-cigarette products, bans online sales to anyone under 21.
About half a million middle school students smoke e-cigarettes - jumping from 3.3% of middle school students in 2017 to 4.9% in 2018, according to the 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey. The trend is even more alarming for high school students, where 1 in 5 used e-cigarettes last year, nearly double the number from 2017. E-cigarettes have eclipsed cigarettes as the most commonly used tobacco product by teens, reversing decades of declining tobacco use among youths, according to the survey.
"It doesn't smell like cigarettes. It comes in a million flavors, from cherry to bubble gum to mint. Kids don't understand a lot of those chemicals that make it flavored can hurt you," Halkins said.
When e-cigarettes hit the American market more than a decade ago, federal and state governments were slow to regulate the product. For example, the advertising restrictions placed on cigarettes don't apply to e-cigarettes, allowing companies to promote their fruity-flavored products on television and in magazines, said Sarah Lawver, director of advocacy for Pennsylvania and West Virginia for the American Lung Association. And spending on e-cigarette advertising increased from $6.4 million in 2011 to $115 million in 2014, according to the CDC.
Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration, which gained regulatory power over e-cigarette manufacturers in 2016, isn't scheduled to review e-cigarette products until 2020.
So, the e-cigarette industry captured some young smokers lost by the tobacco industry after decades of public health campaigns by rebranding cigarettes as flavorful, clean and fun, Corwin said.
During his presentation, Corwin showed a picture of colorful vape products in fun fonts.
"This looks like Sour Patch Kids," he said, referring a popular brand of chewy candy.
"Talk about deceptive marketing. You want to talk about bait and switch?" he said.
On its website, Juul says it stopped selling non-tobacco and non-menthol pods in stores, and shut down its Facebook and Instagram accounts in the United States.
"Underage vaping is a serious problem. Juul Labs is committed to preventing underage use and has taken the most aggressive actions of anyone in the industry to proactively curb underage use," Kevin Burns, then-CEO of Juul Labs, said in a statement on the website.
Public campaigns against cigarette smoking have successfully discouraged students from smoking by stripping away the glamour and highlighting the bad hygiene, smell and health risks. But e-cigarette marketers distanced the product from cigarette smoking, presenting vaping as an entirely different habit.
"'I don't smoke. I just vape.' Has anyone heard that before?... They've done a fabulous job of marketing, right?" Corwin asked. "Able to separate smoking from vaping. Smoking is disgusting. Who would do that? That's hideous. I just vape."
That certainly rings true for Madison Ekdahl, a Salisbury High School student who has heard that sentiment expressed many times. "Everyone says it's better than smoking," she said.
It's hard to know how to talk to her friends about vaping, she said. "You don't want someone to stop being your friend."
School districts are stepping in with programming to discourage students from vaping. The Bethlehem Area School District has a vaping webinar for teachers and is considering presentations to students. In the Salisbury Township School District, administrators brainstormed with students about how to teach about vaping, such as in large class assemblies and small group conversations.
The New York Times reported that on Monday three districts - in New York, Kansas and Missouri - sued Juul, accusing the company of endangering students and forcing schools to devote time and money to fighting nicotine addiction.
Vaping is not allowed in schools across the Lehigh Valley, and students caught breaking that rule face the same consequences as those caught smoking cigarettes.
However, vaping is easier to hide than smoking, Halkins said. Some vaping products look like a thumb drive and can fit under bracelets or wristbands.
With the health scare associated with vaping, lawmakers across the country are under pressure to make it harder for students to purchase e-cigarettes, such as raising the age to purchase and use tobacco products to 21 and regulating e-cigarettes the same way as tobacco.
State Sen. Mario Scavello, R-Monroe, one of the senators who has introduced a bill lifting the smoking age to 21, said the goal is to keep cigarettes away from 18-year-olds who may spend time with younger teenagers.
"You don't want them to be exposed to it so early," he said.
Eighteen states, including New Jersey, New York and Maryland, and the District of Columbia have raised the smoking age to 21, according to the American Lung Association. Juul came out in support of such legislation last year.
While the evidence and arguments against vaping are compelling, students are unlikely to listen to adults about it, Nancy Thomas, a middle school health teacher and mother of teenagers, said at the St. Luke's assembly.
"You got to find the right speaker. Otherwise, they're just hearing sounds. They're not listening."
The best person to get through to teenagers is a teenager, she said.

Texto completo: "I think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could," Mr. Sanders said. "No apologies."
Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Wednesday that he knew he had suffered a heart attack three days before his campaign released that information, but he defended the decision to keep those details private.
Mr. Sanders's campaign had been inundated with questions from the news media last week as he recovered at a hospital in Las Vegas, and speculation about whether he had had a heart attack spread on social media and among voters. Campaign officials waited until Mr. Sanders was released from the hospital on Friday, smiling and waving to news reporters, before disclosing that he had.
In an interview with NBC News, Mr. Sanders said a doctor at an urgent care facility in Las Vegas, where he went last Tuesday night after experiencing chest pain, had informed him that he was having a "heart event." The interviewer then asked if the doctor had said he was having a heart attack, to which Mr. Sanders said, "Yeah."
His campaign did not announce that until Friday, saying only that doctors had inserted two stents to open a blocked artery -- a fairly common procedure. A heart attack, known medically as a myocardial infarction, means that there was at least some damage to the heart muscle.
Mr. Sanders, 78, rejected the idea that his campaign had showed a lack of transparency in not disclosing the information more quickly.
"No, I don't accept that. I think that's a media thing," he told NBC, adding that his campaign had been trying "to understand what in fact is going on."
"I think we did it appropriately and did it as quickly as we could," he said. "No apologies."
His wife, Jane Sanders, said in an interview with The New York Times that she had received the heart attack news on Thursday, and that it was her decision to wait to release that information until her husband was discharged the next day.
Mr. Sanders and his family were dealing with another crisis at the same time: the cancer diagnosis of his daughter-in-law, Rainè Riggs. Ms. Riggs -- who was married to Mr. Sanders's son Levi Sanders -- died this weekend at age 46.
"I heard it on Thursday," Ms. Sanders said, referring to her husband's heart attack. "But frankly, I wasn't thinking about the campaign."
Asked in the NBC interview what voters should think with regard to the future of his campaign, Mr. Sanders said: "People should think that I had a procedure which hundreds of thousands of people a year have. People should think that according to the doctors, I'm on the way to a full recovery."

Texto completo: New Farrow book details alleged attack during 2014 Winter Olympics
Matt Lauer was accused of raping a former NBC News employee in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, according to journalist Ronan Farrow, who details the allegation in his forthcoming book "Catch and Kill."
As first reported Tuesday night by Variety, Farrow devotes a chapter to the alleged attack and its aftermath at NBC. On Wednesday, the network's "Today" show - where Lauer worked for more than 20 years - took a somber turn as his former colleagues addressed the news.
NBC News correspondent Morgan Radford warned viewers of "graphic" details as she reported the former employee's allegation that Lauer forced her to have anal sex after she repeatedly declined.
The former employee, identified as Brooke Nevils, had been drinking in the company of colleagues, including Lauer, in the hours before, and told Farrow she had gone to Lauer's hotel room after he summoned her. She had not been expecting him to initiate sexual contact. "He always treated me like a little sister," Nevils told Farrow in the book, a copy of which has been obtained by The Washington Post. "I had been to his room many times."
As Radford noted on "Today," Nevils was at the center of the 2017 complaint that prompted Lauer's abrupt firing. At the time, NBC News said Lauer had been fired for "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace," and promised to keep Nevils's identity anonymous at her request. More women came forward to accuse Lauer of misconduct - including allegations that he once gave a colleague a sex toy as a gift and that he had exposed his penis to another female colleague.
"Today" co-hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb were emotional as they addressed the report Wednesday. "I feel like we owe it to our viewers to pause for a moment. This is shocking and appalling, and I honestly don't know what to say about it," Guthrie said, sounding on the verge of tears. "I know it wasn't easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then - it's not easy now - and we support her and any women who come forward with claims."
"It's just very painful for all of us who are at NBC and at the 'Today' show," she added. "It's very, very, very difficult."
As Kotb acknowledged, the moment was strikingly similar to the 2017 "Today" episode that found the pair announcing Lauer's firing to the world.
"I'm looking at you and I'm having a weird moment, that we were sitting here just like this two years ago," Kotb told Guthrie. She then turned her attention to viewers, noting that she and Guthrie had prayed ahead of Wednesday's broadcast.
"You feel like you've known someone for 12 years," Kotb said. "And I don't know if you guys have ever felt like that - you know someone . . . you feel like you know them inside and out, and then all the sudden, a door opens up and it's a part of them you didn't know."
"And we don't know all the facts in all of this, but there are not allegations of an affair," she added. "There are allegations of a crime."
Farrow also makes this point in his book, writing that, in 2017, "NBC leadership and the press had deemed" her story "a consensual affair."
Lauer cast their relationship as such in a letter provided to Variety on Wednesday through his lawyer. In the lengthy statement, Lauer emphatically denies the allegation, which he said is "categorically false, ignores the facts, and defies common sense."
Lauer begins his letter by addressing his decision to not speak out against what he called "some of the false and salacious allegations leveled at me."
After concluding that his "silence was a mistake," Lauer writes: "Today, nearly two years after I was fired by NBC, old stories are being recycled, titillating details are being added, and a dangerous and defamatory new allegation is being made. All are being spread as part of a promotional effort to sell a book. It's outrageous. So, after not speaking out to protect my children, it is now with their full support I say 'enough.' "
Lauer repeatedly refers to his relationship with Nevils as an "affair" and notes that "it showed terrible judgment on my part, but it was completely mutual and consensual."
On "Today," Radford noted that Lauer was fired a day after Nevils and her lawyer met with NBC's human resources department. According to Farrow's book, Nevils went to HR at the suggestion of Meredith Vieira, the longtime "Today" journalist she had worked for in Sochi.
Farrow writes that Nevils "left out nothing" in her discussion with HR reps - including subsequent encounters with Lauer, such as the time he allegedly requested oral sex in return for contributing to a goodbye video Nevils made for her ex-boyfriend, another NBC colleague.
Farrow's book also notes that Nevils and Lauer had sexual encounters in the former "Today" host's Upper East Side apartment and in his office, and that "sources close to Lauer emphasized that she sometimes initiated contact."
But Farrow writes that Nevils "lived in terror of Lauer jeopardizing her career and that the encounters caused anguish and shame."
"It was completely transactional," Nevils told Farrow of her continued encounters with Lauer. "It was not a relationship."
The author describes a devastating fallout for Nevils, who said she felt betrayed by the network's management as Lauer's alleged misconduct was presented as infidelity. And although her identity was hidden from the public, it was not necessarily so at work. NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack cited the Sochi Olympics in his statement about Lauer's firing, Farrow notes, "narrowing the potential complainants to a small group of women on that trip with proximity to Lauer."
Nevils threatened to sue NBC after the Comcast-owned network "offered her one year's salary to depart and sign a nondisclosure agreement," Farrow writes. She eventually agreed to a seven-figure settlement in exchange for not talking about the matter publicly because, as Farrow writes, she felt she "didn't have a choice" because of "the damage she felt the network had done to her reputation."
Nevils later agreed to share her story with Farrow because of his bombshell reporting on decades of alleged predatory behavior by influential Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. ("I saw myself in those stories," Nevils told the author. "And when you see the worst part of your life in the pages of The New Yorker, it changes your life.") Farrow's work - along with explosive reports by the New York Times - was central to the 2017 reckoning against Weinstein and other powerful men.
Those reports revealed a culture of complicity that, according to Farrow, pervaded NBC's top ranks, where Lauer's alleged misconduct was reportedly an open secret. Farrow, a former investigative correspondent for NBC News, had initially been reporting on Weinstein for the network. But, the author contends, NBC ultimately killed the story because of pressure from Weinstein himself.
Weinstein, whose alleged efforts to intimidate and silence both his accusers and journalists have been well-documented in Farrow's work, had caught wind of Farrow's reporting and began a pattern of contacting top NBC executives - including Lack, NBC News President Noah Oppenheim and MSNBC President Phil Griffin. According to Farrow, Weinstein's strategy involved American Media Inc., which publishes the National Enquirer; the tabloid had obtained reports of other alleged misconduct by Lauer, which Weinstein threatened to expose in repeated conversations with NBC execs.
NBC told the Hollywood Reporter in a statement Wednesday that "NBC News was never contacted by AMI, or made aware in any way of any threats from them, or from anyone else, for that matter."
"And the idea of NBC News taking a threat seriously from a tabloid company about Matt Lauer is especially preposterous, since they already covered him with great regularity," the statement continued.
On "Today," NBC News addressed Nevils's allegation Wednesday with a statement Radford read on-air: "Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time. That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague."

Resumen: Baseball/softball is my favorite sport to write about. Because I spent so much time playing the game, I feel I have a better grasp on the nuances and quirks of the game. When evidence grows that a president has abused his power or broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to investigate. [...]I believe it is important for the House to proceed if for no other reason than to make it clear to future presidents the limits of executive power. 5 What would you consider to be your single greatest accomplishment in the newspaper business?

1 What were your thoughts when SIU Athletic Director Jerry Kill decided to leave SIU again to become assistant coach at Virginia Tech?
Disbelief and a little disappointment. I thought Jerry had really come back to SIU to stay. He didn’t explicitly say this is where he would end his career, but I think people believed he would be here for the long haul. Jerry did a lot of good in his short tenure as SIU’s AD, but I, like of lot of other people, feel there is still work to be done. Having said that, I know how much coaching means to him. A person has to follow his/her dreams.
2 What is your favorite sport to write about?
Baseball/softball is my favorite sport to write about. Because I spent so much time playing the game, I feel I have a better grasp on the nuances and quirks of the game. On the other hand, there is nothing I like better than watching Saluki basketball. The speed of the game, the athleticism of the players is breathtaking.
3 You will retire in a few months from the Southern, where you were a reporter, sports editor and outdoors editor. What is your take on the future of print journalism?
I think it will always exist. Small-town papers are vital to the health of their communities. Newspapers cover school boards, city councils and county boards. Someone needs to serve as watchdog of the taxpayer’s dollar and newspapers are uniquely positioned to do that — either in print or augmented by online coverage. And, in these trying political times, the New York Times and Washington Post are thriving because of their investigative work. Again, newspapers are better able to devote time, resources and space to in-depth investigative journalism.
4 You have also been a member of the Southern Illinoisan editorial board. What do you think about the impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump?
No person is above the law. Members of Congress, of both parties, have taken an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States. When evidence grows that a president has abused his power or broken the law, it is the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives to investigate. In this political climate, at least at this moment, it is unlikely the Senate would convict the president. However, I believe it is important for the House to proceed if for no other reason than to make it clear to future presidents the limits of executive power.
5 What would you consider to be your single greatest accomplishment in the newspaper business?
Surviving. And, that’s only half-facetious. Over the years, I’ve covered presidents, governors, big-time athletes, goose callers, high school athletes and the everyday hobbies of the guy/gal who lives next door. The best accomplishment? Having people say this story or that story made me smile. Thanks. That makes it all worthwhile.

Texto completo: It started when Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey posted a (now-deleted) tweet with an image that said "Fight For Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong." Within hours, The Chinese Basketball Association, sportswear brand Li-Ning, SPD Bank, state broadcaster CCTV's sports, and tech-giant Tencent all announced they would suspend business with the Rockets. We know the Chinese government organized this swift punishment because so many Chinese entities shunned the team so quickly; in China that only happens with official approval.
Morey, under pressure, issued a partial apology, saying, "I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event."
The NBA issued a measured statement in English calling Morey's views "regrettable," and a more apologetic statement in Chinese, saying, "We are extremely disappointed in the inappropriate remarks made by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey."
Beijing is costing the Rockets millions while pressing them to apologize - and implicitly threatening every other NBA team. The punishment came before the trial. That's how coercion works. It's how the Chinese Communist Party operates.
But the Chinese government's massive, punitive and coercive reaction to Morey's tweet must not be allowed, because the CCP is using its government power to bully Americans and American organizations to shut up about its repression. The fact that the NBA is playing along just shows how powerful Beijing has become in getting U.S. institutions to do its political bidding.
Lawmakers and Democratic presidential candidates have quickly and rightly criticized the NBA today for folding on human rights in pursuit of cash in China. But it's not the NBA's job to stand up to the Chinese government; that's a job for the U.S. government.
The U.S. government must first explain to the American people that this is not an isolated incident; Beijing has been exporting its political censorship abroad as part of its comprehensive effort to interfere in free societies. Last year, China severely punished Marriott after an employee in Omaha, Nebraska, "liked" a pro-Tibet tweet. Marriott profusely apologized and fired the employee.
Next, Chinese authorities demanded all international airlines literally wipe "Taiwan" off their maps, under threat of economic punishment, in what the White House called an instance of "Orwellian nonsense." In this case, the U.S. carriers resisted and Beijing partially backed down.
Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta tried to claim on Twitter that his team is "not a political organization." As the New York Times noted, the NBA supported Enes Kanter's right to speak out about the abuses of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The NBA stands with me for freedom and democracy. It's made all the difference," Kanter tweeted Sunday.
But unlike the Turkish government, the Chinese government can hold billions of dollars in business over the NBA's head. LeBron James and the Lakers are set to play the Brooklyn Nets in Pudong and Shenzhen this week. If the Rockets, the most popular NBA team in China, can be banned over a tweet, there's no mystery why the rest of the league is running scared.
U.S. companies are not strong enough to resist Chinese government coercion on their own. The U.S. government needs to do much more to make sure U.S. companies don't have to abandon their values at the point of an economic gun.

Is Trump's 'war' on California just for show?

Texto completo: Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
It's easy to find an obvious motive for President Trump's well-documented and much-ballyhooed "war" on California. After all, this state in 2016 gave Hillary Clinton a margin of more than 3 million votes over Trump and he's felt hurt and angry over it ever since.
He's taken action after action against this state's best interests, one example his September attempt to eliminate California's unique authority the early-1970s Clean Air Act to regulate its own air quality.
Even though Trump and his hand-picked chief of the federal Environmental Protection Agency moved the other day to revoke that ability, most legal authorities say he can't actually do it because California's right to fix its air was granted by Congress, not the President of that time, Republican Richard Nixon.
Presidents have a lot of executive authority, those legal experts say, but they cannot unilaterally reverse acts of Congress.
Showing its whimsical nature, Trump's administration shortly after announced it would withhold highway funds from dozens of California areas because they don't meet federal clean air standards — even though some of the affected areas do in fact meet those standards.
So Trump wants to penalize California for having dirty air at the same time he seeks to take away its ability to clean up that same air. Go figure, or as Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein deadpanned, the combined moves "seem counterintuitive."
Trump also threatens to withhold federal grants from police in California's many "sanctuary cities." He warned he would cut federal wildfire aid and penalize San Francisco because its homeless population allegedly dumps human waste and hypodermic needles into the Pacific Ocean and San Francisco Bay. Except they don't do that.
Time after time, Trump trumpets actions against California, with the state's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, reacting with lawsuits like a Pavlovian laboratory dog.
But does Trump really mean all this seriously, when he's had so little success at it? Or is another agenda at work here?
This question arises because the pre-presidency Trump was in effect a carnival barker, always aware of the legendary circus impresario P.T. Barnum's observation that "There's a sucker born every minute." Trump the showman understood while running his reality television show that, as a New York Times television critic observed, "the only rule is that there are no rules."
He carried this sense over into his presidency, where a day rarely goes by without some crisis, be it a threat to bomb Iran or one to punish California. Trump also knows that California-bashing is a longtime, popular national pastime everywhere outside the Golden State.
So when Trump blasts America's longtime allies and cozies up to the most murderous of foreign dictators, it may all be for show, with the sense that as long as he keeps America entertained, he can get on with his real interest, which is making profits.
It's an approach completely unlike any previous President, and one whose ultimate consequences are unknown as an impeachment inquiry gets started. But it is fairly clear that Trump stands little chance of making good on most of the attacks he's made against California.
Top state officials say they are fairly certain of that, despite a Supreme Court that's upheld some other unprecedented Trump actions, like his condoning the caging of small immigrant and refugee children.
Said Gov. Gavin Newsom, who seems to enjoy sparring with Trump, and so is part of the President's new show, "If Trump prevails, we will have more asthma in California...and other diseases. But that's the state of things today in this country...We will fight back when he goes after our Dreamers and our health standards. And we will win in the courts."
Added Becerra, "If the arguments in the President's tweets are the arguments they will use to propel (legal actions), then we're looking pretty good and we will enjoy facing them in court."
The trick here is to see Trump's real apparent motive: Less to hurt California or the potential victims of his actions than to keep the spotlight constantly on himself, impeachment investigation or not, and thereby help ensure another presidential term and even more personal profits while he steers government and foreign spending to his many properties.

Netflix star Samin Nosrat mulls going part-time vegan

Texto completo: Samin Nosrat's laugh is delightful and infectious. It's the kind of warm uninhibited chorus that makes you feel not only like you've known the New York Times best-selling author for years, but also that she couldn't be more happy to talk with you today.
This charming, approachable persona is an undeniable part of the reason why Nostrat's Netflix series "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" — inspired by her James Beard Award-winning book of the same name — has been hailed for changing the food show landscape forever.
In the four-part series, viewers see Nosrat lose herself in the pleasure of a piece of aged Parmesan cheese, giggle as her eyes water while chopping onions and do an adorable happy dance with a friend as they devour a dish while standing around the kitchen counter.
It's a show that's as much about food, where it comes from and how to make it, as it is about watching someone simply enjoy it.
The show premiered on the streaming platform almost a year ago, and Nosrat's been busy in the intervening months. She's already begun work on a second series and thinking about her next book, "What to Cook."
She's also hitting the road, crisscrossing the country for evening events during which she chats with local hosts about food, cooking and anything else that might come up when she fields questions from the audience.
We chatted with the author, TV star and chef about what fans can expect.
Question: So, what can people expect from this tour?
Answer: We basically laugh a lot (laughs) and then, I mean, each conversation is different, which is something I really love about it.
One thing I'm really excited about that is that I edited this year's edition of "Best American Food Writing." I was pretty riled up when I was doing the editing and writing the forward but what I'm excited about is I think it will rile people up when they read it. I did my best to highlight all sorts of different issues beyond what we just consider to be food and I'm really excited to get to talk about the wonderful diversity of the writing.
The other thing I'm thinking so much about is climate change and how food affects and is affected by it.
I have been reading a lot about climate change and agriculture and food and I feel like — and I'm so hesitant to say this, but I gotta start saying it somewhere — I feel like the only responsible thing for me to do is become a daytime vegan. And I really don't want to. Like I really don't want to but I feel like it's something I have to do and I feel like it's what I need to, not necessarily bully other people into doing, but at least model for people. Changing out diets is the single most powerful thing we as individuals can do.
It's both depressing and exciting. (laughs)
Why getting a show was a 'whiplash moment' Q: It sounds like you maybe have been thinking about using your platform to be an activist? Or raise awareness, maybe?
A: I wouldn't use the word "activist." I still do have a relationship with the New York Times so I have not fully jumped into activism. But I do think education and awareness is really important and it's my job.
I found out that Netflix was interested in the show two days after the 2016 election and it was a really hard time for me. I really felt that that election said to me, personally, that people who look like you are not wanted here. So I was sort of sitting with the grief of that and then found out this thing two days later.
It was a really whiplash moment for me and I took it really seriously and thought really carefully about whether I wanted to put myself in the public eye when the public had made it clear that people who look like me or are from the part of the world that my family is from are not necessarily considered American or welcome here.
I did in the end decide that I did want to do it and I was like, OK if I am going to do this then I'm going to use it to promote the kind of message that's really important to me, which is one of unity and sharing with people my ultimate belief that we are more similar than different across the world.
So I don't know that I would use the word "activist" necessarily, but I do think that there are so many things in our daily lives that feel really overwhelming. Changing a habit is really hard. I get how hard it is. I have my own really conflicted decisions about changing the way I eat and yet my brain understands that it's what we all have to do. Or it's what I have to do at least.
What being 'daytime vegan' means Q: But vegan? I don't know if I could give up cheese...
A: Well, the thing is it's daytime vegan (laughs)
Q: So, only when the sun is up?
A: Totally. Basically, statistically, if you give up animal products for two of your meals, you end up using less carbon than if you're a full-time vegetarian. I think if I fully had to give up cheese and dairy and butter it would just be like, I couldn't. I would die.
One of the books I've been reading is by my friend Jonathan Safran Foer. He has a new climate change book coming out, and he proposes this and his whole book is about his own personal difficulty with it and also the understanding that if you don't do it, you're just a person who didn't do something when the moment required it.
Q: I know you're working on another book. Can you share anything about what people can expect in "What to Cook"?
A: Yeah! I mean to be completely honest I have not actually started working on it because I am going to make another TV series first. I'm in the sort of development part, which is like the brainstorm part of the show, so that's been taking up most of my mental energy.

Texto completo: Nancy Drew is reimagined in a new CW series. And a new season of the legal drama "Goliath" is streaming on Amazon.
What's on TV
NANCY DREW 9 p.m. on the CW. Sex, darkness and a dash of the supernatural are added to the Nancy Drew formula here, in a series that reimagines that classic young sleuth for a contemporary audience. The hourlong drama raises Drew's age to 18, and it relocates the action to Maine. The show also gives Drew (played by Kennedy McMann) a tough back story: In this show, she has a strained relationship with her father, and her mother has recently died. There are also ghosts, an element that factors into the show's first major case, which involves the murder of a socialite. "At the core is the idea of a young woman who believes in righting wrongs and finding the truth," Stephanie Savage, a creator of the series, said in a recent interview with The New York Times.
FAMILY TIME 9 p.m. on Bounce TV. Six seasons have gone by since this sitcom introduced Anthony Stallworth (Omar Gooding) and Lisa Calloway-Stallworth (Angell Conwell), a married couple who started off the series by winning the lottery and relocating to the suburbs. The seventh season sees the couple transitioning into empty nesters. That lifestyle should support more quips among their fellow adults, like Cheryl (Shanti Lowry), whom, in Wednesday's season premiere episode, explains a new home "security system" to Lisa. "Basically, it's just a recording of a couple arguing," she says. "That way it always sounds like there's someone bickering at home."
What's Streaming
GOLIATH Stream on Amazon. Amy Brenneman, Illeana Douglas, Griffin Dunne, Beau Bridges and Dennis Quaid are among the celebrity guests in the third season of this legal drama, which stars Billy Bob Thornton as a lawyer with a troubled past. This season centers on a parched California vineyard, where a death is apparently the indirect product of corporate greed.
ANTHROPOID (2016) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. The actor Cillian Murphy is back in the spotlight right now as a 20th century gangster in the new season of "Peaky Blinders" on Netflix. On Hulu, find him hunting the infamous Nazi Reinhard Heydrich in this World War II thriller. Directed by Sean Ellis, the film is an account of the true Czech-British mission to assassinate Heydrich, the main architect of the Final Solution. Murphy and Jamie Dornan play Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis, soldiers who parachuted into enemy territory to hunt Heydrich. It takes the movie "a while to build steam," Andy Webster wrote in his review for The Times. "But once it does, hang on."
LIVING UNDOCUMENTED Stream on Netflix. This six-episode docuseries follows undocumented immigrants from eight families in America as they navigate the immigration system, endure bias and seek asylum. The subjects have come from a wide range of places -- Mexico, Honduras, Colombia, Laos, Israel and Mauritania -- and their differing experiences and challenges reflect the range of realities that families face when trying to make a new life in the United States.

Texto completo: Signs at the SoHo location, which opened in 1977, say the closing is only temporary, but the company is mum.
Dean & DeLuca has closed its flagship store in SoHo, after months of financial turmoil in which it shuttered all its other New York City stores. Two notices on its locked and grated front doors Monday announced the store's "temporary closing," and said it "will reopen soon."
Asked to elaborate, a Dean & DeLuca spokeswoman said in a text message Tuesday that she was hearing only "silence" from Pace Development, the Thai real estate company that bought the cafe and grocery chain in 2014.
Pace's chief executive, Sorapoj Techakraisri, told The Nation, an English-language paper in Thailand, this summer that he planned to expand the brand into major Asian capitals.
When The New York Times reported the first of the New York closings in July, Dean & DeLuca confirmed that it was shutting three of its stores in New York. Four more closed in August, and a Midtown location closed in September. The company's website no longer lists the SoHo location, only Dean & DeLuca's two remaining United States stores, in Hawaii. Calls on Tuesday to both Honolulu shops confirmed they are still in operation.
In New York, suppliers had complained that they had not been paid, and employees said their paychecks had been frequently delayed.
The SoHo store stayed open throughout the summer, despite nearly empty bins and shrinking customer traffic. Signs saying it would close for renovations hung on pillars in recent weeks.
When the store opened in 1977, it quickly became a destination for imported and specialty foods.
"We have been a proud part of this neighborhood and building for over 30 years," the signs on its doors read. "From all of the Dean & DeLuca team, we thank you for all the years of support you've given us."
Above, in lipstick, someone wrote, "SO SAD!"

Texto completo: The timeline of the Intelligence Community whistleblower complaint stemming from a discussion between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows just how quickly a controversial phone call turned into the calls for impeachment that have gripped Washington, D.C.

July 25, 2019 — Trump and Zelensky spoke by phone for roughly half an hour, while top officials such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listened in. Trump asked for a "favor" from Ukraine in investigating a conspiracy theory related to the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, which determined the Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee’s email systems, an assessment special counsel Robert Mueller and the U.S. Intelligence Community agreed with. Trump also urged the Ukrainian leader to look into any Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election. Trump brought up his request related to CrowdStrike immediately after Zelensky asked about purchasing anti-tank weaponry, known as Javelins, from the United States. Trump also talked about "the other thing," suggesting the Ukrainians investigate allegations of corruption related to 2020 Democrat Joe Biden and his son, Hunter. Trump urged Zelensky to speak with Rudy Giuliani, his personal attorney, and Attorney General William Barr. Giuliani had spent months publicly urging Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, but the Justice Department quickly made it clear that Barr wasn’t associated with the effort.

July 25, 2019 through Aug. 12, 2019 — The whistleblower said he spoke with numerous U.S. government officials with knowledge of the call and other activities within the White House, the State Department, and elsewhere connected to the Trump administration and its Ukraine policy. The New York Times reported that the whistleblower had a CIA colleague communicate some concerns to the CIA’s top lawyer, after which the whistleblower spoke with a staff member on the House Intelligence Committee days before the complaint was officially submitted.

July 26, 2019 — The whistleblower wrote that now-resigned U.S. Special Envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker traveled to Kyiv to meet with Zelensky “and a variety of Ukrainian political figures” and gave “advice to the Ukrainian leadership about how to ‘navigate’ the demands that President [Trump] had made” to Zelensky. Text messages among Volker, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, and U.S. Chargé d’Affaires to Ukraine William Taylor in the following weeks show them pushing Ukraine to declare its intent to investigate issues related to the 2016 election and Burisma.

Aug. 2, 2019 — The whistleblower said “multiple U.S. officials” told him about an Aug. 2 trip by Giuliani to Madrid to meet with Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak in person, characterizing the meeting as a “direct follow-up” to the Trump-Zelensky call about the “cases” they’d discussed. Giuliani disputed this, saying the meeting was already in the works before that call. Giuliani spoke with Yermak prior to July 25, and that call is mentioned by Zelensky to Trump. Giuliani says Volker put him “in direct contact” with Yermak days before the Trump-Zelensky call and that Yermak indicated Ukraine was open to pursuing these investigations. The whistleblower also said Giuliani reached out to other Ukrainian officials, too.
Aug. 12, 2019 — The whistleblower complaint, addressed to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, was submitted to and received by the office of the Intelligence Community inspector general, led by Michael Atkinson. The whistleblower complaint alleged, among many things, that U.S. officials believed that the Trump-Zelensky call transcript was “locked down” in a potentially “abusive” way and were “deeply concerned” by Giuliani’s “circumvention of national security decision-making.”

Aug. 26, 2019 — Atkinson sent a letter to acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, letting him know about the existence of the complaint, summarizing its claims, informing Maguire that Atkinson determined that the whistleblower “appears credible” and that the complaint is of “urgent concern,” and recommending the information be provided to the appropriate congressional committees.

Sept. 2, 2019 — At an overseas press conference, Vice President Mike Pence was asked about the meeting he’d had with Zelensky the day before and, first, whether he’d discussed Joe Biden “at all” and, secondly, whether he could assure Ukraine that the hold-up of money has “absolutely nothing to do with efforts, including by Rudy Giuliani, to try to dig up dirt on the Biden family.” Pence replied that “on the first question, the answer is no.” But Pence then went on at length, adding, “but as President Trump had me make clear, we have great concerns about issues of corruption.”

Sept. 3, 2019 — A group of five bipartisan senators wrote to Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to “express our deep concerns” about nearly $400 million dollars in military aid for Ukraine being delayed.

Sept. 9, 2019 — Atkinson wrote a letter to Schiff and Rep. Devin Nunes of California informing the Intelligence Committee chairman and ranking member of the existence of the whistleblower complaint and that Maguire had informed him that the complaint was not required to be handed over to Congress. Atkinson disagreed, saying that while he believed Maguire was “acting in good faith," he didn’t think Maguire’s decision was “consistent with past practice.” That same day, three Democrat-led committees announced a “wide-ranging investigation” into reports that Trump and Giuliani had pressured Ukraine to help with Trump’s 2020 reelection bid.

Sept. 10, 2019 — Schiff wrote to Maguire that he had been made aware of the whistleblower complaint and claimed that Maguire was “required” to hand it over immediately.

Sept. 11, 2019 — Republican Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said he spoke with Trump “to ask him to release the security funds for Ukraine” and Trump agreed to release the money that day.

Sept. 13, 2019 — Schiff made the existence of the whistleblower complaint public after Maguire informed him that day that he was declining to provide him with the complaint, with Schiff accusing Maguire of improperly withholding the information from Congress and issuing a subpoena to compel Maguire to hand the complaint over to Congress. That same day, Jason Klitenic, the general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, wrote a letter to Atkinson informing him that, after consulting with the Justice Department, Maguire had determined “that no statute requires disclosure of the complaint” to Congress because the allegations in the complaint didn’t relate to the conduct of a member of the Intelligence Community or to anyone under Maguire’s supervision.

Sept. 17, 2019 — Atkinson wrote to Schiff and Nunes that himself and Maguire were “at an impasse” due to “unresolved differences" and informed the congressional leaders that he was bound by the determination made by Maguire not to hand the complaint over, although he “respectfully disagreed with it.” That same day, Schiff went on MSNBC where he was asked whether he had heard from the whistleblower and misleadingly stated that “we have not spoken directly with the whistleblower" even though an Intelligence Committee staff member had spoken with the whistleblower and had made Schiff aware of at least some details related to the whistleblower’s allegations.

Sept. 18, 2019 — Schiff informed Maguire that he was accepting his offer to testify on Sept. 26, 2019.

Sept. 19, 2019 — Schiff met with Atkinson behind closed doors. That same day, the Washington Post claimed that the whistleblower complaint “made by an intelligence official centers on Ukraine” and that it “involved communications with a foreign leader and a 'promise' that Trump made.”

Sept. 20, 2019 — The Wall Street Journal wrote that the whistleblower complaint alleged that Trump had “repeatedly pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden’s son.” Biden declared that “such clear-cut corruption damages and diminishes our institutions of government by making them tools of a personal political vendetta” and called for the Trump-Zelensky call transcript to be released. Trump defended the call as “totally appropriate.”

Sept. 24, 2019 — Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that “the House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry.”

Sept. 25, 2019 — The Trump-Zelensky call transcript memo was released by the White House.

Sept. 26, 2019 — The whistleblower complaint was declassified and made public. Maguire also testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee, where he said he believed the whistleblower had “acted in good faith.”

STUDY FINDS RESEARCHERS WILLING TO MISREPRESENT THEIR WORK

Texto completo: Trisha Phillips of West Virginia University set out with her colleagues to answer an uncomfortable question that is relevant to the workplace in general and her field in particular.
The question: How often do faculty researchers misstate fact?
The study didn't focus on common measures of scientific integrity, such as veracity of research results. Instead, the team she co-led wanted to know how often researchers misrepresent their research accomplishments in applying for a university job.
In various corporate fields - from finance to engineering to public relations - the difference between polishing a resume and fabrication is perilous. The team found that academia is not immune: Some 44% of total curriculum vitae examined generally, and 56% of those that claimed authorship, contained one or more unverified or inaccurate research citations.
The pilot study, published in the Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics, is based on one research university's hiring during a single year - an institution the team intentionally kept confidential.
"When scholars express concern about trust in science, they often focus on whether the public trusts research findings," stated the study, whose lead author is Ms. Phillips, an associate professor of political science. "This study explores a different dimension of trust."
The researchers would like to expand the work to look at other universities. But Ms. Phillips said what the team found in their pilot study, published in July, suggests a problem to which campus leaders should pay heed, as it approximates a broader workplace problem.
To conduct the research, the team gathered curriculum vitae submitted for faculty positions during 2015-16 that met the study's criteria and examined a manageable subset of one-tenth of the total, Ms. Phillips said.
Of 180 applicants analyzed, 141, or 78%, claimed to have at least one publication. Of those 141, 79 - 56% - "listed at least one publication that was unverifiable or inaccurate in a self-promoting way."
The study had limitations that could have over- or understated the inaccuracies. For example, there was difficulty obtaining books and journals in languages other than English, and the researchers looked only at reported publications and not the veracity of grants, past employment or other credentials claimed by job seekers.
"We were initially trying to determine whether and how frequently people were lying. You can't truly know that without intent," the researchers wrote. "So, we looked for other indicators. We considered any inaccuracies that were not self-promoting to just be accidents."
Twenty-seven inaccuracies fell into the apparently accidental category, compared to the 79 that were self-promoting.
The team noted that there is a problem generally in the workplace with falsehoods, including a study by The Society of Human Resource Management in 2012 that found more than 50% of resumes and job applications contain falsifications.
In addition, the society found 70% of college students admit they "would lie on a resume to get a job they want," the researchers said.
The team also pointed to some high-profile falsehoods within academia.
Among them was a 2004 case involving then-Albright College President Henry Zimon, who resigned after he was accused "of lying about his academic and publishing record," said the team, citing The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The embellishments included a forthcoming book "for which he had neither a manuscript nor a publishing contract, and claiming a postdoctoral position at Harvard when in fact he had only given a guest lecture," they said.
They also cited a 2007 case involving Marilee Jones, then dean of admissions at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She departed after conceding she had falsified her resume by misrepresenting her academic degrees, said the researchers, quoting coverage in The New York Times.
They also cited a case involving WVU researcher Anoop Shankar, then professor of epidemiology, accused of offenses including falsifying his credentials to obtain grants.
The researchers limited their study to faculty positions with research expectations in non-health science programs. The 141 applicants claiming to be authors had among them 1,127 publications current or forthcoming.
Within that total, the researchers found 193 instances of unverified or inaccurate research citations.
Among the problems: six articles in journals that could not be located; 72 articles not found in journals that were located; 31 books and book chapters unable to be found; 24 forthcoming articles not found in journals that were located; four instances of authorship insertion, 27 instances of authorship promotion, 27 instances of authorship omission, and five generally categorized as "other," researchers said.
In addition to Ms. Phillips, the team included co-leader Lynne Cossman, professor and chair of the WVU Department of Sociology and Anthropology; R. Kyle Saunders, doctoral student in sociology at Florida State University; and Elizabeth Heitman, professor in the Program in Ethics in Science and Medicine at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Texto completo: At the New York convention, fans donned green wigs and smeared on clown face paint for the opening weekend of the "Joker" film.
At Comic Con, where attendees show off meticulously prepared costumes inspired by their favorite fictional characters, one generally does not dress up as the Joker without knowing which Joker they are.
Are they Heath Ledger's Joker from "The Dark Knight?" Are they Mark Hamill's cartoon villain? Or Jared Leto's, or Jack Nicholson's? Or have they harkened all the way back to the 1960s to portray Cesar Romero's merry prankster version?
At this weekend's convention at the Javits Center in Manhattan, there was a new Joker character to consider. The "Joker" movie opened in theaters this weekend, and this rendition of the comic book character, played by Joaquin Phoenix, has drawn scrutiny for exhibiting psychological traits of real-life mass shooters.
The chilling twist to the Joker's past has been criticized for having the potential to inspire young men with similar inclinations. At Comic Con, some costumed Jokers clung instead to the characters of the past, while others embraced Phoenix's tortured portrayal.
The New York Times spoke with several Jokers at Friday's convention about their costumes and how they feel about Hollywood's latest interpretation of the Joker.
Andrew Santos, 32
Occupation: Manager at American Airlines
Hometown: New York City
Santos hasn't gotten a chance to watch the "Joker" movie yet, but all he needed to see was the trailer to decide that he was going to dress like Phoenix's Joker at Comic Con. He loves the DC Comics version of the character, but Phoenix's performance looked like it was going to be special.
"The movie is going to be something dark that you shouldn't take children to," Santos said. "But I like movies where you see it from the other side, the villain's side. You don't necessarily sympathize with them, but it's a different view."
He said he considers the definitive origin story of the Joker to be his falling into a vat of chemicals that turns his hair green, his skin a chalky white and his mouth blood red. But he appreciates the filmmaker's attempt to add depth to the character's background -- even if it's a disturbing narrative.
Mei Velasco, 30
Occupation: Medical assistant
Hometown: High Point, N.C.
Velasco describes her costume as Ledger's Joker from "The Dark Knight" -- but "girl-ified." (Her husband dressed up at Harley Quinn, the Joker's frequent accomplice and love interest who fell for him while treating him at a psychiatric hospital.)
She said the costume was easy to throw together: She found the jacket at Target, the neon green wig on sale and for the makeup, she found an online tutorial for Joker-style face paint.
Velasco said she considers the true-to-life angle of the "Joker" film to be potentially instructive to audiences rather than harmful.
"I feel like what he's trying to say is that our society looks like it's going toward that way, so this is like a warning," she said, "It's like, 'Hello, everybody, wake up!"'
Andrew Rancy, 31
Occupation: Employed at a tile distribution business
Hometown: Marlboro, N.J.
Rancy didn't want to choose just one Joker to portray, so he took pieces of several versions of the character to incorporate into his outfit.
He kept his mustache as a homage to Cesar Romero, who left his own facial hair for the television adaptation of the Batman comic book. The green dreadlocks were inspired by the Joker's hair in the Batman cartoon. And the royal purple coat came from Ledger's Joker.
Rancy said he was impressed by the new movie but he could see the possibility for some viewers to interpret Phoenix's character as a figure worth emulating, something that relatives and friends of those killed in the Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting expressed concern about in a letter to Warner Bros.
"It does delve deep into mental illness and how, in some areas of society, not a lot of people understand or know how to handle it," Rancy said.
"You can't really predict these things," he continued, "But I can see some people taking it too far."
Julio Cruz, 25
Occupation: Wrestler and fitness center employee
Hometown: Rahway, N.J.
Cruz was so set on playing Phoenix's version of the Joker that he bought the movie-specific costume on Amazon just for the occasion.
"I was the 'Dark Knight' Joker previously," Cruz said. "I'm just a Joker-head. This is one I wanted to take on."
He committed to getting the makeup right, too. When the first set of face paint he purchased didn't look right, he went to the store at 1 a.m. to find the right stuff. He decided to apply the makeup the night before the convention, which meant that he had to make himself fall asleep on his back in order to not mess it up.
Cruz said he planned to see the movie on Friday night in his costume. He said he considered it important that the film takes on issues of mental illness. Cruz doesn't think filmmakers should shy away from that subject.
"It's art," he said. "The way you perceive it is how you perceive it."
Krystal Valle, 27
Occupation: Phone technician

Valle doesn't just know which Joker character she's dressed up as. She knows the exact movie scene she's portraying: In "The Dark Knight," Ledger's Joker dresses up in a white nurse's outfit as part of a scheme to blow up Gotham General Hospital.
"I've already done Harley. Harley had her time," Valle said. "I wanted to do nurse Joker."
It's a particularly evil version of the Joker character. But Valle said it's ultimately just a character in a movie, and that if a person does something violent, they should be blamed -- not the movie.
"It's just like the whole 'video games are causing violence' thing," she said. "It all depends on who the person is."

Giacalone's Joker cosplay is a bit more relaxed than his Comic Con counterparts. He said it was just the easiest option after he procrastinated on his costume. Giacalone already had the velvet jacket and vest lying around, and he could buy inexpensive white gloves online.
He didn't really know which particular Joker he was playing, though someone had suggested to him that he looked like a steampunk Joker. He plans to see the film -- but not in costume. While riding the train on Friday morning in his get-up, Giacalone said he sensed some of that concern. He was carrying an overnight duffel bag, and some other passengers looked worried.
"I felt like I was getting looks from people," he said, "so I tried to do normal things like take out my granola bar and have a snack."

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
In rural Barnard, Vt., the local general store was the only place you could get a copy of The New York Times or The Boston Globe. That was until the day last year that Barnard General Store announced that it would stop selling copies of out-of-town newspapers.
On the local listserv, a sort of online forum, residents of the town shared every opinion they had on the decision. They criticized the general store for cutting off the community from print news. Some waxed poetic about the important differences between reading the news online and in print. A few even said that people who read The Times were snobs.
The cries were heard, eventually making their way to Oliver Szott, a budding entrepreneur who had previously sold craft sodas at the farmers market, as well as his own electronic music online. After some suggestions and assistance from his mother and neighbor, Oliver, 14, opened up shop as the town's newest, and only, purveyor of out-of-town newspapers.
"I've read and flipped through a bunch of papers over time," Oliver said. "Because of how my dad would read the paper, that kind of made me have an appreciation for print newspapers."
Print circulation for American newspapers is in decline. In 2018, weekday circulation dropped 12 percent from the previous year, while digital circulation rose by 6 percent during the same period, according to the Pew Research Center. The figures for Sunday circulation were similar. Some publications have slashed the number of days they produce and deliver print papers, and retailers like Starbucks have stopped selling newspapers altogether.
In February 2018, the Barnard General Store announced that it would no longer carry copies of The Times or any other out-of-town publications because of a price increase by the store's out-of-town newspapers distributor, White Mountain News. Under the new pricing, the general store would have had to pay the full retail cost of the papers to White Mountain News, in addition to the delivery fee.
By August, Oliver had drawn up a plan for filling the demand by paying White Mountain News the full retail cost for the papers plus delivery, then selling them for retail plus a dollar surcharge. This would save passionate readers a drive of over 15 minutes to a neighboring town to pick up a copy of The Times.
"This is what happens in remote America, where entrepreneurs take hold," Mark Weitzel, the vice president of circulation operations at The Times, said about Oliver's business.
Oliver admitted that his foray into print news wasn't driven by any romantic sentiments of newspapers or personal connections to the industry. Rather, he figured he could at least learn through this experiment how to better communicate with customers and suppliers, as well as how to notify potential customers about a product's availability, as was the case with The 1619 Project, a Times initiative that examines slavery's legacy in America.
"When people heard about the special edition," Oliver said, "some people who were not my regular customers showed up because they knew I was the newspaper guy."
In the beginning, Oliver sold copies of The Times, The Boston Globe and The Wall Street Journal six days a week at a local church, pulling in a couple of regular weekday clients, and 14 regular customers plus walk-ins on Sunday.
Later that fall, he relocated his business to his family's home. But by April this year, weekday sales were slumping. So Oliver, too, cut back. He now sells the Sunday paper from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m., with only The Times and The Globe for sale.
"A lot more people were upset about the discontinuance of the service at the general store than read the paper," Ted Williamson, a longtime customer, said.
Every weekend now, after assembling the dropped-off papers and their inserts, Oliver leaves stacks of the Sunday papers on the end of his family's small, white-fenced porch. Although he monitors pickups through the windows while eating breakfast or doing homework, there's a box for people to drop off $ 7 for a paper using the honor system.
He sells around six copies of The Times and one of The Globe each week, which translates to $ 2 or $ 3 profit a week on average. Plus, Oliver's mother, Pamela Fraser, said: "Every once in a while, he'll get a tip."

Trump's Trade Delusions

Texto completo: The president and his advisers have been deluded about what big tariff hikes and aggressive negotiating tactics will achieve.
Debating trade issues with President Trump's anti-trade supporters is a constant game of goal shifting. If you point out that the Trump tariffs are raising revenue for Uncle Sam on the backs of American consumers, they reply that China is hurting the most. If you note that the trade war is the main reason the stock market is losing its mind, not actions by Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, they reply that China is "a brutal Communist police state that abuses its own people and steals from the world."
Mr. Trump and his team of unrepentant protectionists have made wild claims about what big tariff hikes and aggressive negotiating tactics will achieve. Let's pick the top five claims. Have any actually panned out? The answer will not come as a surprise. (It's no.)
Claim 1
Let's start with an easy one. On March 2, 2018, when Fox Business Network's "Mornings With Maria" asked whether China would retaliate against the metal tariffs, Mr. Trump's economic adviser Peter Navarro replied, "I don't believe any country in the world is going to retaliate for the simple reason that we are the most lucrative and biggest market in the world."
He was wrong: Everyone has retaliated against us. A recent study by the economists Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve, Stephen J. Redding of Princeton and David Weinstein of Columbia shows that our trading partners, "especially China, have retaliated with tariffs averaging 16 percent on approximately $ 121 billion of U.S. exports."
Claim 2
The president said that tariffs are "a powerful way to get companies to come back to the USA." Mr. Trump can't do much more than point to anecdotes of companies relocating to the United States. But the broader trend tells a different story. Most companies can't afford to shift their supply chains to use domestically produced parts or move their production back home. Data show that when companies move out of China, they're relocating to other countries in Southeast Asia.
Even the Commerce Department acknowledges that companies face a tariff-related challenge when thinking about moving back here. Expect this trend to continue because the future of most manufacturing in America -- including the automobile industry -- is in exporting. Rising production costs in the United States means that to stay competitive, an increasingly large number of businesses will shift their production abroad.
The bottom line: It means fewer manufacturing jobs here than otherwise, not more.
Tariffs are just not a good way to sustain a domestic manufacturing revival. After picking up some steam in 2017 and 2018 thanks to deregulation and tax reform, the manufacturing sector is cooling down. The latest jobs report shows that in 2019, manufacturing employment has risen by a monthly average of 5,000 jobs. In 2018, that number was 22,000.
A recent survey by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturing contracting in September and capital investment growth is slowing down, too. Even the heavily protected steel and aluminum sectors have started to see a decline in jobs this year.
Claim 3
On that same day that Mr. Navarro was talking nonsense, the president tweeted that "trade wars are good, and easy to win." Wrong again. Instead, we found out that they are bad and difficult to wind down. We are nowhere near a trade deal with China. In fact, apart from a deal with South Korea, which required no congressional approval, no comprehensive and better trade deals are yet on the books, and most pending agreements are subpar when compared with what was agreed to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
Meanwhile, the trade war has pushed our trading partners to sign trade deal agreements -- not with us, but with one another. The list includes Japan and Europe, Europe and the Mercosur zone in South America, and Europe and Mexico. As Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics documented, China's tariffs against the United States rose to 20.7 percent on June 1, 2019 from 8 percent on Jan. 1, 2018 -- but its tariffs against all other countries went down from 8 percent to 6.7 percent during that same period.
Claim 4
"Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries" of the trade war with China, Mr. Trump tweeted in May. Also wrong. Farmers have suffered on all fronts in this trade war. For starters, they saw their production costs rise thanks to the metal tariffs that increased the cost of farm equipment.
Farmers have also been devastated by the retaliation from many countries. For instance, soybean exports to China will most likely -- and perhaps permanently -- be one-third of what they were last year. Exports of dairy products to China have dropped more than 50 percent, too. Obviously, if farmers did so well under Trump's trade war, he wouldn't need to provide them with $ 28 billion in aid.
Claim 5
During his campaign, Mr. Trump said that he would wipe away the trade deficit. Aside from the fact that this is a foolish goal, his trade disputes have achieved quite the opposite. As my colleague Daniel Griswold documents, "During President Obama's second term in office, from 2013 through 2016, the monthly trade deficit in goods and services averaged $ 40.7 billion; under President Trump the monthly deficit has averaged $ 50.1 billion."
A reduction in the bilateral trade deficit is a meaningless measure of success because when one deficit goes down, many others go up. Case in point: The deficit with China is going down, but it has been more than offset by rising bilateral deficits elsewhere, including with Vietnam and Mexico. Imports from China are also down 12 percent, but exports to China are down 19 percent. So even by the president's own mercantilist standard, he is failing.
The bottom line is that pretty much everything Mr. Trump has promised on the trade front by imposing tariffs hasn't panned out, even if the president persists in saying the opposite.

Demands for Baby Banquets?

Texto completo: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortex was holding a Climate Change town hall in a Queens Public Library on Oct. 3 when an impassioned young woman rose from the audience with an unusual proposal. I quote: “A Swedish professor [said] we can eat dead people, but that’s not fast enough. So I think your next campaign slogan has to be this: ‘We got to start eating babies! We don’t have enough time! There is too much CO2.”
This blithering would have provoked immediate dismissal in a sane world. But sanity is rarely a feature of climate control gatherings, Representative AOC neither endorsed nor repudiated this slogan. “I’m so happy that you really are supporting New Green Deal,” she replied, “but it’s not enough, you know. Even if we would bomb Russia, we still have too many people … we need to treat the climate crisis with the urgency that it does present … Luckily we have more than a few months. We do need to hit net zero in several years.”
Her anonymous interlocutor ignored this namby-pamby evasion and repeated her demand. “Too much pollution,” she persisted, “so we have to get rid of the babies! That’s a big problem. We need to eat the babies!”
The Swedish professor invoked by the young woman is Magnus Soderlund, a social scientist who recently delivered a speech entitled “Can you imagine eating human flesh? This was his contribution to the Stockholm Gastro Summit conference entitled “Food of the Future: Worms, Grasshoppers, or Human Flesh.” President Trump seized the opportunity to call Representative Bright Eyes Ocasio-Cortez “a Wack Job.” The Wack Job tweeted right back, saying it’s “better than being a criminal who betrays our country.” Donald Trump Jr.’s contributed a comment that the cannibal advocate “seems like a normal [Ocasio-Cortez] supporter to me.”
It turns out that the young cannibalism advocate was a provocateur working for the LaRouche PAC, which liberal commentators identify as a group of right-wing Trump supporters. Readers who are interested in this group might want to visit their website at https://larouchepac.com/
I first became aware of LaRouche when I read a story on the front page of the New York Times in 1974 (nearly as I can remember). A young woman had thrown messages from an apartment building window saying that she was being held prisoner. When the police rescued her she explained that a little group of LaRouchians were “reprogramming” her. They happened to know something the police did not. They knew about a powerful diabolic group that could capture the minds of its victims and command them to do all kinds of things, many of them nasty. Only LaRouche and his closest assistants could resisted the programming.
Now some background, LaRouche was active in the Socialist Workers Party, a Trotskyite faction from 1948 to 1963. His personal cult appeared in the late sixties as a splinter off the radical leftist Students for a Democratic Society at Columbia University. It evolved into the Marxist National Caucus of Labor Committees. He ran for president on the United States Labor Party in 1976. Later her ran for president in the Democratic, or in the Republican primaries. I can’t remember which date, but I do remember that he once got more Democratic votes in Connecticut’s primary than Jerry Brown. I remember thinking that this spelled the end of Jerry’s political career. No such luck for California.
I first became an activist Republican in 1979, on behalf of Ronald Reagan. That’s when I had my first personal encounter with the LaRouche cult. An elderly Republican party official visited me at home with happy news about an anti-Carter Democrat named Cohen who had come from Washington to coordinate with New Jersey Republicans. He had given the activist a stack of his organization’s newspaper, “New Solidarity,” for distribution. After I explained the LaRouchian origin of his newspaper the old guy wanted to give young Mr. Cohen a piece of his mind. I suggested it would be more productive to ask for more stacks on New Solidarity and then take them to the dump. So it was done.
Rutgers University seemed to have a significant group of cultists back in the eighties. Posters appeared there regularly. The art work was pretty good and the texts described the vast conspiracy controlled by Nelson Rockefeller, Queen Elizabeth, the CIA, the KGB, the New York Police Department, and the Anthropology Department at New York University. As it happens I knew a grad student who subscribed to the cult’s glossy magazine at $360 a year. Turns out the conspiracy went all the way back to the Byzantine Empire and incorporated Frances Merovingian Dynasty. Very convincing, it was illustrated by, among other things, a photo of the tomb of Dagobert I. Yessir, an actual photo of Dagobert’s tomb. Can’t argue with a picture.
Rutgers students appeared at Middlesex County College every spring to set up a LaRouchian table with copies of New Solidarity and other inspiring literature. The first few years they dressed counter-culturally. Then orders came down from the Leader and they begin to show up dressed like Mormon missionaries.
Moving on to more recent times, we find that LaRouche welcomed the election of Barack Obama and warned that he was in “grave and imminent danger” of being assassinated by the “British Empire.” By 2015 he started demanding Barack’s impeachment – he had discovered that the wretch was organizing an act of war that endangered the United States and all of humanity.
This somehow fits right in with the news that the 2003 invasion of Iraq was a neoconservative conspiracy orchestrated by Dick Cheney. Lyndon LaRouche died early this year, so he never got around to exposing Donald Trump for … whatever. It suits the left-leaning media to describe these crank-cultists as “right-wing.”

New Trump whistleblower to speak up

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – A second whistleblower "in connection to" the allegations surrounding the call between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will be coming forward, according to that person's attorney.
"I can confirm that my firm and my team represent multiple whistleblowers in connection to the underlying August 12, 2019, disclosure to the Intelligence Community Inspector General," tweeted attorney Andrew Bajak, whose firm Compass Rose also represents the first whistleblower.
Mark Zaid, another Compass Rose lawyer, told ABC News about the firm's representation of a second whistleblower.
ABC News reported that the second whistleblower – "described as an intelligence official – has firsthand knowledge of some of the allegations outlined in the original complaint."
According to ABC, the second whistleblower already had contacted Intelligence Community inspector general Michael Atkinson but had not yet reached out to any of the House Intelligence Community -or other congressional committees involved in the impeachment inquiry.
Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., said on CBS News' "Face the Nation" that the House Intelligence Committee has not heard from a second whistleblower and added that "people around the president, professionals who are in the Oval Office, who are in the situation room, are watching what is happening and finally saying, 'My God, this cannot happen anymore.'"
The seven-page whistleblower complaint released to the public Sept. 26 had helped spark an impeachment inquiry by revealing that Trump had pressured the Ukrainian president to open an investigation into his political rival former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
The complaint also said White House officials had tried to "lock down" details of the call.
Republicans had criticized the first whistleblower for not having firsthand knowledge of the call, though the Intelligence Community inspector general had found the complaint credible, and other information consistent with the complaint was publicly reported.
Trump has railed against the whistleblower as having the "facts wrong about the phone call" and tweeted on Saturday evening in response to a New York Times report Friday about a second whistleblower coming forward.
It is unclear if the whistleblower represented by Zaid is the same person.
"The first so-called second hand information 'Whistleblower' got my phone conversation almost completely wrong, so now word is they are going to the bench and another 'Whistleblower' is coming in from the Deep State, also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!" Trump wrote.
Zaid later tweeted what appeared to be a response to those who had criticized the first whistleblower for not having firsthand information.
According to Zaid, the second whistleblower had firsthand possession of "certain info," but "there is NO legal requirement for any (whistleblower) to have such knowledge. Law only requires a 'reasonable belief.'"
Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, when asked on "Fox News Sunday" about a second whistleblower related to the Trump's call with Zelensky, said, "It does not matter."
"This person is going to come forward and say, 'Yep, the president had this phone call,'" Stewart said. "And yep, we have this transcript. Why should I care at all?"

Texto completo: WASHINGTON -- "Are you O.K.?" Andrew G. McCabe, the acting F.B.I. director, asked Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general.
"No," Mr. Rosenstein replied.
"Are you getting any sleep?" Mr. McCabe asked.
"No," he said.
It was Friday morning, May 12, 2017, three days after President Trump had summarily fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director.
The conversation is described in a new book that portrays Mr. Rosenstein as anguished and isolated as he struggled with the realization that Mr. Trump might have ousted Mr. Comey to obstruct the F.B.I.'s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election -- and that he would probably have to appoint a special counsel to take over the inquiry, even if it cost him his job.
The book, "Deep State: Trump, the F.B.I. and the Rule of Law" by James B. Stewart, provides new details about the history-making interactions between top Justice Department and F.B.I. officials immediately after the president ousted Mr. Comey. It recounts how Mr. Rosenstein was so troubled by Mr. Trump's behavior that he twice proposed that he secretly wear a wire and record the president in the White House, the second time in the presence of an F.B.I. official who took notes.
Drawing heavily on reporting by The New York Times, Mr. Stewart, a Times reporter, also fleshes out how Mr. Rosenstein raised with Mr. McCabe the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment, which allows a vice president and a majority of cabinet members to remove an unfit president from office. In a new detail, he wrote that Mr. Rosenstein told Mr. McCabe during a May 16, 2017, meeting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, would most likely support such a move.
"At times he got up and walked around the table," Mr. Stewart wrote of Mr. Rosenstein during the meeting in the deputy attorney general's office. "At one point, he was so upset he went into an adjoining bathroom to compose himself."
That evening, Mr. Rosenstein revealed that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Kelly to run both the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security as part of a "strategy for disruption," according to the book. "You've got to be kidding," Mr. McCabe told him.
For his part, Mr. Kelly was deeply disturbed by Mr. Comey's ouster. He called Mr. Comey as soon as he learned of it, saying that "he felt sickened by Trump's decision to fire him and wanted to quit in protest," the book said. "He didn't want to work for someone so dishonorable."
Those reservations were apparently short-lived: Mr. Kelly went on to serve as Mr. Trump's chief of staff for 17 months.
The book does not resolve the mystery of how Mr. Rosenstein managed to hang onto his position after The Times, more than a year later, reported the gist of his conversations about the 25th Amendment and secretly recording the president.
Mr. Rosenstein at the time publicly dismissed The Times's September 2018 article as "factually incorrect." He added in a statement, "Based on my personal dealings with the president, there is no basis to invoke the 25th Amendment."
Despite widespread speculation that the president would fire him, Mr. Rosenstein remained in his post until this May, overseeing the investigation by special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, through its conclusion.
The book also offers new details about the F.B.I.'s decision to open a counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Trump one week after he fired Mr. Comey. According to Mr. Stewart, the firing itself convinced Mr. McCabe and four other top F.B.I. officials that they had sufficient reason to open the inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had acted at Russia's behest. The decision was unanimous, according to the book.
Mr. McCabe and another official were later fired from the bureau for unrelated reasons; the other three officials have also left.
On May 17, the day after he met with Mr. Rosenstein, Mr. McCabe briefed the so-called Gang of Eight, a bipartisan group of senior congressional leaders privy to major intelligence issues, about the decision. According to Mr. Stewart, only Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, asked a question. He wanted to know if the investigation was also a criminal inquiry; Mr. McCabe said criminal charges could result.
Mr. Rosenstein, who also briefed the congressional leaders, appointed Mr. Mueller as the special counsel the same day.
Before the president fired Mr. Comey, Mr. Rosenstein had written a memo suggesting that Mr. Comey should be dismissed. But it quickly became clear to him that his arguments for terminating Mr. Comey were entirely different from the president's.
Mr. Rosenstein had argued that Mr. Comey made critical errors in handling the F.B.I.'s investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was the secretary of state.
But when the White House tried to pressure Mr. Rosenstein to state publicly that firing Mr. Comey had been his idea, not the president's -- thus cloaking the president's real motivation -- Mr. Rosenstein refused, with Mr. Sessions's backing. He said he would not be part of a "false story," Mr. Stewart wrote. In a broadcast interview two days after he fired Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump admitted that he acted because of "this Russia thing," not Mr. Rosenstein's memo.
According to the book, the sense that Mr. Trump had used him deeply unsettled Mr. Rosenstein, who had been in his post less than two weeks. Mr. Stewart described the May 12 meeting with Mr. McCabe in detail, saying that Mr. Rosenstein struggled to keep his emotions in check.
"His voice was wavering, his eyes teared up. He said he couldn't believe what was happening," according to Mr. Stewart's account.
"There's no one here I can talk to about this. There's no one I can trust," Mr. Rosenstein confided to Mr. McCabe, whom he knew only slightly.
He added, "The one person I wish I could talk to is Jim Comey."

After Madea, Tyler Perry builds a new kingdom

Texto completo: ATLANTA - Tyler Perry hears voices in his head, and they have made him wildly popular, divisive and very rich.
The voices created the Paynes, the Browns, the Cryers and countless other characters and caricatures that peopled Perry's plays, movies and television series. And they unleashed his golden goose, Madea, the smack-talking, purse-wielding black Southern matriarch that Perry depicted, in tent dresses and a pendulous prosthetic bosom, in dozens of plays and films before retiring the character earlier this year.
Now, with Madea behind him - he was fed up with playing her - Perry's cultural legacy remains complex, ever evolving, and dependent on what he does next. In the short term, that means opening sprawling new studios here with a big, glittery party this weekend. The studios will serve as the home for an astonishing six new shows, all of which he has written and will direct - part of a major content deal with Viacom.
Is he sacrificing quality for quantity? Perry said he was not aspiring to great artistry. "It's a business," he told me. "And key in this business is to deliver to this audience, to superserve them and give them everything they want that you can give them."
In many ways, Perry still feels like the most successful mogul Hollywood has ever ignored.
"If I was a white man and had done these things, and had this success, they would have had a much different reaction to me," Perry said one late September day, sitting in his huge, plush office in the Dream Building, the center of the new studios south of downtown. "No one, Black or white, has been able to do what I've been able to do."
Undisputed is his employment of scores of Black actors, particularly women, who struggled to find work in mainstream Hollywood, an achievement Perry deftly referenced in June when he collected the Ultimate Icon Award at the BET honors.
Hollywood can talk about #OscarsSoWhite, he told the crowd, but "I'll be down in Atlanta, building my own, because what I know for sure is that if I could just build this table God will prepare it for me in the presence of my enemies."
The crowd leapt to its feet, the performer Lizzo among them. It was a measure of the reverence for Perry's achievements, and the recent warmer embrace of his work. Spike Lee, who once infamously described Perry's work using a racial slur, has since distanced himself from that comment. (For what it's worth, aside from "Inside Man," Perry told me, "there's not a lot of Spike Lee films that I get or understand.") And Perry is no longer one of the very few Black voices in film and television. The rise of power brokers like Ava DuVernay, Donald Glover and Issa Rae, Perry said, has "lifted all of the pressure."
Many of the stories Perry tells adhere to his tried-and-true formula; threaded with moralizing, they confront tough issues like abuse before shifting to levity, all of which proved deeply cathartic for audiences, and for Perry himself.
Perry grew up in New Orleans with an abusive father, and was sexually molested by several adults. To cope, he learned to slip into a rich, imaginary world. "It would bring me so much joy, no matter what was going or. with me as a kid," he said.
It was only recently that Perry realized that he goes to that same place to write. "I literally have to push them out of my head to go on to the next show, to make them stop talking," he said.
He wrote all six new Viacom shows, along with a new season of "The Haves and the Have Nots," for Oprah Winfrey's OWN network - 200 episodes in all - in six months. The writing overlapped with the 43-city Madea farewell tour earlier this year, and I caught a glimpse of what that workload looked like at Radio City Music Hall in May.
A capacity crowd cheered Perry's longtime castmates, Tamela Mann, Cassi Davis and David Mann, reserving the biggest whoops for Madea herself. Backstage, Perry spent every moment at his laptop, in full Madea regalia, working on one of the new Viacom shows, typing as if possessed. "I'm on autopilot," he told me. He stopped to issue stage directions, punk the other actors by messing with their props, and, of course, to star in the show. He spent exactly zero seconds in repose.

Lujan Grisham's political profile grows with buzz over policies

Texto completo: National media coverage about a plan to eliminate college tuition.
Unveiling new fuel economy standards at a climate change event in New York.
Withdrawing National Guard troops from the border in a challenge to President Donald Trump.
These are just some of the policy initiatives Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has pushed in New Mexico during her first nine months in office that are garnering national attention -- the kind that creates inevitable talk about bigger, if not necessarily better, political landscapes.
"Her actions on the state level and the solutions she's pursuing are creating a buzz," said Christina Amestoy, deputy communications director at the Democratic
Governors Association in Washington. "National press and other states are really taking notice of what she's able to do and thinking about ideas on what could happen on a federal level and in other states as well."
In part, this may be because the partisan gridlock in Congress makes any flurry of initiatives at the state level more noticeable, Amestoy said, adding issues the governor is taking on happen to align with those at the forefront of national policy conversations and in the Democratic presidential race.
For instance, there's climate: A recently inaugurated Lujan Grisham issued an order aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state.
There's gun control: She's already signed a controversial background check bill and wants to pass so-called red-flag legislation in the next session.
And others: The governor is making legalizing recreational marijuana a priority and has taken on other contentious issues, such as an abortion bill that failed earlier this year.
Asked about national attention, Lujan Grisham's office said the governor is only focused on New Mexico.
"If you're doing great things for New Mexicans, I suppose it's possible that you will be noticed outside of these borders," spokesman Tripp Stelnicki said. "That's not at all what we're paying attention to or aiming for or interested in."
Perhaps, but some people in Democratic circles in Washington say they've heard Lujan Grisham's name mentioned more often in influential policy circles and also on the sidelines of the Democratic debates.
"I've recently heard of people talk about her for VP," said Colm O'Comartun, who is a partner at Washington-based consulting firm 50 State and the former director of the Democratic Governors Association. "Now, nobody as a first-term governor is going to want to encourage that kind of conversation. But I was at the debates and as people asked, 'Who would you put on a ticket?' there was talk about her.
"That's just chitchat," he continued, but "she brings a brightness and excitement that is unusual among the 50 governors of the U.S."
Doug Thornell, a principal at political consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker who was a senior adviser to the Democratic National Committee, called Lujan Grisham "a rising star in the party" who has "a lot of good buzz inside the Beltway and actually beyond."
"Whoever the nominee is, they're probably going to take a look at her," said Thornell, who has also been a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. "She's an accomplished governor, a Latina and has been able to get some significant things done when a lot of things aren't getting done in D.C. All of those things add up."
And Adrienne Elrod, senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, said she also had noticed increased attention around Lujan Grisham's policies in New Mexico.
"Anytime you get a New York Times story or you're getting booked on MSNBC, people are going to say, 'Why is she getting national attention?' " Elrod said. "People are going to start buzzing about that."
Elrod said she hadn't heard Lujan Grisham's name as part of the vice president rumor mill but believed she could be a good option for the eventual nominee.
"She would be a very attractive candidate for vice president or higher office at some point, should she decide to go that route," said Elrod, who also is an MSNBC contributor. "The ticket has to have a woman and has to be diverse in some way, so someone like Lujan Grisham fits the bill. But there are many others who do, too."
The governor's spokesman reiterated last week that Lujan Grisham is not aiming for any other positions, and Lujan Grisham said as much in a July interview with The New Mexican.
"I want to be focused on this job," she said at the time. "I know it may sound trite, but I want to do a great job. I do that by being focused on being governor."
Even if the governor isn't seeking national attention, that doesn't mean she's not getting it.
U.S. Rep. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., said he has noticed "growing excitement" around Lujan Grisham nationally, with mayors and governors in other states taking note of some of her policies.
"Michelle Lujan Grisham charging forward to get us to net-zero emissions in New Mexico by 2045 is something that has been applauded across the country," Lujan, the assistant House speaker, said in an interview. "Big city mayors are taking notice that she's moving policy forward and that we're standing up to the Trump administration when it comes to climate standards."
Former state officials who worked with former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson have made similar comments.
"It's natural that she is attracting national attention," said Paul Bardacke, former state attorney general and chairman of Richardson's 2002 gubernatorial campaign. "That is what happens when you take firm stands on important issues rather than just see which way the wind blows."
"There are a lot of people around the country who think she has star power," said Michael Stratton, a senior consultant to Richardson's 2008 presidential campaign. "There is some buzz around the country that she could be a good match to be a VP candidate."
One factor that may bring more attention to Lujan Grisham over the next year is Trump's declared intention to try to flip New Mexico in next year's presidential election, said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.
Lujan Grisham already has challenged key Trump administration policies on border security and climate, for example, and such opposition could be noticed more nationally if the president is campaigning here.
"If the Trump people follow through," Sabato said, "there
will be a lot of attention on
New Mexico."

Texto completo: A person could watch Roger Ross Williams’ “Traveling While Black” on The New York Times’ website, where it was first posted in January.
But if you haven’t seen it through a virtual reality headset, as viewers can at Salt Lake City’s Broadway Centre Cinemas starting this week, “you basically haven’t seen it,” Williams said.
“The beauty of VR, especially with a subject like this, is that you can’t escape it,” Williams said in a phone interview last week. “You are trapped in that reality, in that world. You can’t eat popcorn or candy, or glance at your cellphone or your watch. You have no choice but to experience what you are experiencing in every way.”
“Traveling While Black” will be presented as a VR exhibit in the lobby of the Broadway, starting Tuesday, Oct. 8, and running through Dec. 31. Admission is free.
The documentary, which premiered in the New Frontier section of this year’s Sundance Film Festival, is a series of conversations about the struggles African Americans have faced over the decades.
The interviews start with people who dealt with restrictions traveling through segregated areas of the country in the 1950s and 1960s. The last interview — with Samaria Rice, whose 12-year-old son Tamir was killed in 2014 by police in Cleveland — shows the pain of racism isn’t confined to the past.
“It’s amazing. I’ve cried in my headset every time so far,” said Barb Guy, marketing director for the Salt Lake Film Society, the nonprofit that runs Broadway and Tower theaters.
'TRAVELING WHILE BLACK’
A VR documentary that captures the experiences of African Americans in the 1950s and today.
Where • Broadway Centre Cinemas, 111 E. 300 South, Salt Lake City.
When • Opens Tuesday, Oct. 8, and runs through Dec. 31; during regular movie showtimes, usually from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Admission • Free; limited to 11 viewers at a time.
School groups • The Salt Lake Film Society is working to make the exhibit open to school groups; plans have not been finalized.
The interviews take place in Ben’s Chili Bowl, a landmark diner in Washington, D.C., known as a safe haven for black travelers. People seeing “Traveling While Black” at the Broadway, as they did at Sundance, sit in a black-box set resembling a diner’s interior — providing the sensation of sitting in the booth or at the counter, listening to people telling their stories.
Williams was approached by Bonnie Nelson Schwartz, who had written a play called “Traveling While Black,” nearly a decade ago. Williams wanted to explore what was then called “transmedia” and began experimenting with storytelling forms at the Sundance Institute’s New Frontier Story Lab.
“I didn’t want to make a traditional documentary,” Williams said. “This is such a subject that calls out to the audience to participate in it, to be a part of it.”
Williams has a long resumé as a documentarian. His 2010 short “Music by Prudence” won him an Academy Award. His feature films “God Loves Uganda” (2013), about the evangelical movement in the African nation, and “Life, Animated” (2016), which follows an autistic man communicating with his family through Disney cartoons, both premiered at Sundance. His next feature — “The Apollo,” about the legendary Harlem music venue — airs on HBO in November.
Williams, working with grants from The New York Times and the MacArthur Foundation, struggled to find the right format for “Traveling While Black.” At one point, he planned to use animation; at another, he hired actors to reenact the conversations. He also went on “VR dating,” spending a year meeting production companies specializing in virtual reality.
Eventually, Williams met Félix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphael, co-founders of the Montreal-based Félix & Paul Studios — and was particularly impressed by their VR documentary “The People’s House,” a 2016 tour of the White House with Barack and Michelle Obama.
“They said, ‘Think about a place that is iconic and important, and basing it there,’” Williams said. “Ben’s Chili Bowl is this incredibly iconic place. It’s a safe space for black people, and it’s part of a community. I know the stories in that place and community have something important to say.”
The restaurant was one safe location listed in The Negro Motorist Green Book, a series of travel guides printed from 1936 to 1966. The Green Book told African American travelers which hotels were open to them, which restaurants would serve them, and which towns were safe to drive through at night. (The guide is mentioned, barely, in last year’s Best Picture Oscar winner, “Green Book.”)
Williams said he wanted his film “to really express the experiences African Americans have had traveling in America in the ‘50s and ‘60s with the Green Book, and connect it to the present day, and what we still experience in America.”
Working in VR has technical challenges, Williams said. For one thing, he had to sit in a “video village” outside of the diner, because if he was in the diner, he would show up in the camera array’s 360-degree view. Editing also is tricky, because there’s no cutting away from an interview subject in the middle of a sentence.
“You have to walk out of the room and let things happen, and hope they happen the way you want them to,” he said.
The results can be worth it.
“It’s amazing to watch people experience it,” Williams said. At Sundance and other venues this year, he said, “people were just weeping, crying into their headsets. I saw this couple holding hands across the table … as they were experiencing it. It’s some very powerful stuff.”

Texto completo: American Dream Meadowlands is hoping to take shoppers to new heights.
The entertainment and retail center, which will open in phases beginning Oct. 25, could become one of the region's first retail centers to offer customers a new way to shop.
By helicopter.
"It paints a bigger picture for you — the whole concept," said Chuck Lanyard, president of retail brokerage firm The Goldstein Group in Paramus. "In today's world, we're such jet-setters where things like that can happen."
The concept is simple: Offer wealthy shoppers a painless, if pricey, way to get to American Dream that doesn't involve sitting in traffic on the congested roadways that crisscross Bergen and Hudson counties. So why hasn't anyone done it yet?
An on-site helipad is a huge investment for "a very elite few who can afford to fly in and out in helicopters just to shop," said Lanyard, who has more than four decades of experience brokering real estate deals for retail tenants in the area. But, he added, American Dream is hoping to lure the kind of shopper willing to spend that kind of money.
Don Ghermezian, president of American Dream, told WWD in May that the center purchased three helicopters, two Rolls-Royces and two Bentleys to bring in customers from Manhattan and the Hamptons. He also said American Dream will have a Rolls-Royce golf cart to whisk VIP guests throughout the property.
When NorthJersey.com asked how a helicopter service might work at the complex, an American Dream spokesperson declined to comment.
"I don't have information to share regarding your transportation questions, but we are planning to make additional transportation announcements prior to opening," the spokesperson said in an email.
Hudson's Bay Company, which owns Saks Fifth Avenue, did not respond to questions about a possible helipad on its store at American Dream, which The New York Post reported.
Although American Dream has not released details about how it plans to fly shoppers to the 3 million-square-foot property in East Rutherford or where a helipad would be located on the property, aviation experts say they are not surprised by the proposal.
"There's always interest in the development of heliports at locations that can service the public, and this is just another way in which helicopters can do that," said Chris Martino, vice president of operations for Helicopter Association International.
Adding a heliport to a project is not that difficult, Martino said. Officials would coordinate with the appropriate local officials to get it approved.
"There are hoops that they need to jump through to make sure that they're complying with all the local regulations," Martino said.
Not the first mall helipad Although having an on-site helicopter service would be a first for a North Jersey mall, shopping centers on both coasts have toyed with similar concepts.
The owners of Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Orange County, New York, have proposed constructing an on-site helipad as part of the mall's upcoming expansion, which also includes building two hotels and a parking deck.
The helipad is "something new" for the mall's Premium Outlets platform, said John Villapiano, vice president of development for Simon Property Group, which operates the New York mall. The concept was inspired by a noticeable demand from shoppers interested in skipping the 52-mile traffic-plagued trip to the mall from Manhattan.
"There are several helicopter operators in and around the city who are eager to engage with Woodbury Common and establish a route for customers willing to pay for the convenience of taking a helicopter," Villapiano said.
Mall officials plan to work with the appropriate local boards to figure out how to include a helipad in the center's expansion, he said. The concept is in an early exploratory phase.
In the past, the outlet mall has coordinated transportation to its site for shoppers flying into nearby airports. The mall has also partnered with helicopter operators to offer round-trip flights from Manhattan during the holiday shopping rush.
"Obviously, it's an expensive way to travel — so not everyone would be coming [by helicopter], and I don't anticipate this to be a regular event," Villapiano said. "It's something that could just provide another amenity for customers who otherwise would maybe not come to Orange County."
In the past, Woodbury has partnered with Blade — a company that lets users book an on-demand flight using an app, similar to the way Uber works for cars.
On its website, Blade offers flights to at least two malls in California — Westfield Century City in Los Angeles, and Westfield UTC in San Diego — through a program called The Westfield Experience. Shoppers can skip the traffic by taking a helicopter and then a "door-to-store" black car to either mall for a day of shopping and dining. The service even comes with a $100 dining credit per flyer.
Those two malls are owned by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, which also runs Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus. A spokesperson said the Paramus mall has not launched any programs with helicopters.
The concept of flying shoppers to malls dates back at least two decades. In 1996, the Mall at Short Hills in Millburn experimented with the idea of flying shoppers to its property.
That year, The New York Times reported that the luxury mall was preparing to launch limousine, ferry and helicopter services that would bring Manhattan shoppers to New Jersey.
The helicopter, which could seat four shoppers, departed from four locations in Manhattan and flew shoppers to Morristown Airport, 10 miles from the mall. Then a limousine took shoppers from the airport to the mall entrance of their choice. The service cost $1,500.
A spokesperson this week said the mall no longer has this service.
A new era for flight Although flying to shop by helicopter may be rare, large corporations with heavy pockets have been tapping carriers for similar services for years.
"There's lots of corporations that have corporate aviation departments with helicopters they use for transporting folks to and from their work sites and to airports," Martino said.
But even that kind of helicopter service is changing in the New York metro area, where American Dream is hoping to lure potential flyers.
At Hudson Yards, the new, mixed-use neighborhood along the Hudson River in midtown Manhattan that is home to offices as well as more than 100 shops and restaurants, Blade recently partnered with Related Companies to offer office tenants weekday flight service from the West 30th Street Heliport to John F. Kennedy International Airport for $195, The Real Deal reported in March. A few months later, Uber launched a similar program called Uber Copter. The program, available now as a soft launch for Uber's Diamond and Platinum members, flies riders from Manhattan to JFK.
"Those are relatively new with regard to a kind of on-demand, if you will, utilization of helicopters to take you from Point A to Point B," Martino said. "That all ties into urban air mobility — the whole next-generation concept of how unmanned systems, for the most part, will develop within urban areas for delivering goods [and] delivering people."
The concept of urban air mobility is still in its infancy.
Companies like Uber, which has proposed developing a flying taxi service by 2023, are at the forefront of this concept. But the aircraft needed for these envisioned services are still under development.
If and when that concept takes off, it's possible that shoppers could be using an on-demand service to get to and from American Dream in the heart of North Jersey.

In Providence, Everyone Has a Buddy Story

Texto completo: A veteran of the newspaper that covered Vincent A. Cianci Jr.'s travails gets all the inside jokes in "The Prince of Providence," the hit play about him. So, it seems, does everyone in the audience.
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The swapping of Buddy stories is a common pastime here. Nearly everyone is in on the game because the man called Buddy was everywhere. At the block parties. At the ribbon cuttings. At the Little League games. In the bars. In your head.
It hardly matters that Buddy, also known as former Mayor Vincent A. Cianci Jr., has resided for the last three years at the St. Ann Cemetery in nearby Cranston. He lives on in anecdotes that sound apocryphal only if you haven't spent time in Providence.
Here's a test. Is the following true or false?
While stewing one night at home, the mayor of Providence summoned a man he believed to be sleeping with his estranged wife. Then, in the presence of a city police officer guarding the door, he tortured and assaulted the man with an ashtray, a fireplace log, a lighted cigarette and a coffee mug.
Good for you if you guessed false. There was no coffee mug.
The story of Cianci's rise and fall (and rise and fall) is the story of recent Providence history; an urban opéra bouffe. So it was all but destined that the city's leading theater, the Trinity Repertory Company, would someday make dramatic use of the rich material he generously provided right up to his death in 2016, at 74.
Destiny fulfilled. "The Prince of Providence," written by George Brant and based on the best-selling biography by Mike Stanton, opened this month to critical acclaim and feverish box-office demand. It has become the Passion Play of Providence.
Adding to the production's local appeal is the knowledge that nearly all its characters were or are actual Rhode Islanders, and any one of those still alive might very well be sitting in the theater seat beside you. Having worked for several years at the Providence Journal, I recognized the thrill of this possibility during a recent performance, just as I recognized the play's leading character -- a man I knew well enough for him to dislike me.
"It's kind of gone beyond meta," Mr. Brant said by phone recently. "The people of Providence play a big part in the play, so it's directed back at them. Many are cheering the local references, but it's more about the makeup of the people themselves. Hopefully everyone is asking: 'This was the longest-serving mayor? What kept him there?"'
The play, directed by Taibi Magar, deftly captures the Tilt-a-Whirl sweep of Cianci's life. The privileged childhood. The law school rape allegation that never went away. His time as a prosecutor fighting the Patriarca crime family. His astounding victory in 1974 over the political establishment to become the city's first Italian-American mayor.
Quick-witted and energetic, Cianci was a political star in ascent, an "ethnic" who gave the Wonder Bread Republicans of the 1970s some cover to feign diversity. He demonstrated his considerable potential with a well-received speech during the 1976 Republican National Convention.
But the man could have taught a Brown University master class in self-destruction. He undid himself with his megalomania, bullying management style and alliances with the city's more sinister forces. When he was forced to resign after his felony conviction in 1984 -- for that assault in his home -- Providence fairly sighed in relief.
But Cianci lingered in the city's consciousness for several years as the bilious host of an afternoon radio talk show. Then, in 1990, he stunned everyone by running again for mayor -- and winning. His slogan: "He never stopped caring about Providence."
It's true that the presumably rehabilitated Cianci improved the look and feel of downtown Providence, and his unwavering support of the local arts scene helped to keep Trinity Rep open. Mr. Brant said that he was initially drawn to the Cianci project "by the idea of doing a profile of someone who once sat in this theater -- who kept the lights on in so many ways."
But it's also true that Cianci's perverse understanding of public service led to yet more corruption, culminating in a second criminal conviction, for racketeering, in 2002. He served several years in federal prison, then resumed his role as acid-tongued radio personality, eviscerating anyone who had dared to succeed him.
In other words: He never stopped.
"The Prince of Providence" maintains a parochial coziness, reflected in the inside jokes that win knowing laughs: the time that monkeys escaped from the zoo to take their own walking tours of the city (true); the stale Oreos that Cianci lackeys ate while he committed that infamous assault (true); the assortment of Cianci toupees, including an "action rug" for use at crime scenes and in inclement weather (true.)
"I think that's part of being the state theater of Rhode Island," Tyler Dobrowsky, Trinity Rep's associate artistic director, said. "It's a responsibility we have: to tell local stories, but also to put our community onstage."
It's a community with zero degrees of separation. Scott Aiello, the actor who captures Cianci in all his pugnacious charm, recalled a recent trip to St. Ann Cemetery. When the woman driving his Uber asked why he was visiting Cianci's grave, Mr. Aiello explained that he was paying respects to the dead man he was nightly bringing to life at Trinity Rep.
Is my brother in that play? she demanded to know.
Who's your brother?
Bobo Marrapese.
That would be the notorious late mobster Frank L. Marrapese Jr., also known as Bobo, whose use of violence as a tool of persuasion was -- enthusiastic.
Umm. He gets a mention.
But will this only-in-Providence vibe, which continues through to the production's astounding ending, play well in other cities? Do you need to know why Cranston works as a gentle punch line? Dear Lord, do you need to know who Bobo was?
The success of Mr. Stanton's 2004 biography, along with the popularity of the podcast "Crimetown," whose first season focused on Providence during the Cianci era, suggests that the play could do well outside the country's smallest state. It has the requisite Shakespearean echoes, and its take on our embrace of political rogues -- even against our own interests -- is timely and universal.
"Buddy was a colorful local character, but he was also an archetype of politics," Mr. Stanton, a former Providence Journal colleague of mine, said. In writing the book, he said, he often thought of Robert Penn Warren's "All the King's Men," a novel ostensibly about Louisiana politics.
I also see larger meaning in the life of a thuggish mayor from a smallish New England city. So here is my Buddy story.
One of the several articles I wrote about Cianci was a profile for The New York Times Magazine in 2000, in which I noted that the mayor of Providence was living in the "presidential suite" of the Biltmore Hotel, next to City Hall. He explained that he had sold his East Side home, where he had once beaten a man, because the time and price were right. (A more likely reason was that he needed to cover the legal costs of the criminal indictment coming his way.)
Cianci spent much of his time being police-chauffeured around his city, a portable lectern bearing the city seal stored in the car's trunk. After hitting a block party or two, and maybe checking again on the elephants at the city zoo, he could often be found at the Biltmore bar, hunched, I wrote, "as if waiting for a tap on the shoulder."
Cianci greeted the profile with chilling silence. After his indictment a few months later, I said hello to him on the steps of the federal courthouse, only to be brushed off. As I walked away, he turned to another reporter and said: "You see that son of a bitch? He's the worst in your business."
The reporter asked why.
"He made me look lonely."
How classically tragic. Here was a man whose unfaithfulness had blown up his marriage. Whose second love had given up on him. Whose only child would die of a drug overdose. Whose further infidelities, to his beloved city, would land him in a federal facility where toupees are banned and no one deserves to be called "Your Honor."
It's not just Providence. Buddys are everywhere.

Texto completo: Téa Leoni is president in her series' final season; and the Shakespeare veteran Corey Stoll tackles the Scottish king.
Theater: The Incomparable Corey Stoll in 'Macbeth'
Oct. 10-Dec. 15, classicstage.org .
For three brilliant summers running, Corey Stoll starred in Shakespearean dramas in Central Park. He played Ulysses in "Troilus and Cressida"; Brutus in "Julius Caesar"; and, just last year, the treacherous Iago in "Othello." Each time, Mr. Stoll was so uncommonly unaffected, so at home inside the language, that it made you exhale just to watch him. You knew you were in excellent hands.
All of which is a strong enticement to the more intimate, indoor experience that will be Classic Stage Company's "Macbeth," with Mr. Stoll ("House of Cards") in the title role of the Scottish thane who would be king. Mr. Stoll's wife, Nadia Bowers -- terrific recently in Aaron Posner's Chekhov adaptation "Life Sucks" Off Broadway -- will play the tactically ruthless Lady Macbeth; while Mary Beth Peil ("The Good Wife") has been cast, intriguingly, as Duncan. Directed by John Doyle, the production starts previews on Thursday, Oct. 10, in Greenwich Village. LAURA COLLINS-HUGHES

TV: Hail to the Chief in 'Madam Secretary'
Oct. 6.
In a parallel universe, we've already elected a female commander in chief: Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord. And she's a dream -- an exemplar of honor and decency, intelligence and candor, who embraces the constitution, a free press and principles of both the left and the right but who won as an independent.
Madam President, a weary country awaits you.
Alas, Bess (Téa Leoni, with whom we'd gladly drink a beer) didn't breeze into office, and she's not about to escape unscathed when "Madam Secretary" returns on Oct. 6 to CBS for its sixth and final season.
The opener jumps ahead to Bess's 100th day in office, when it is revealed that Iran had leaked salacious information about her former presidential rival. It caused his campaign to crash and burn while it might have bolstered hers -- and undermined the legitimacy of the election.
But it's not all war games. When the first gentleman (Tim Daly) alludes to the couple's waning sex life on "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," Bess is forced to address the imbalance within their relationship. Turns out that power really is the ultimate aphrodisiac. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Dance: William Forsythe Quiets Down
Oct. 11-25; theshed.org .
When a choreographer like William Forsythe names a production "A Quiet Evening of Dance," he means it. The innovative artist is back with a program at the Shed in Manhattan, which strips movement from ornamentation and, to a great extent, music. A combination of new and existing works, Forsythe's latest features seven of his most experienced dancers who use the sound of their breath to guide them through his intricate, slippery and virtuosic -- though never conventionally showy -- choreography.
The evening highlights two commissioned works, "Epilogue" and "Seventeen/Twenty-One," as well as reimagined repertory pieces. It's a welcome return from this American who danced with the Joffrey Ballet before relocating to Europe and building a reputation for transforming classical ballet by pushing the limits of strength and agility. In a sense, after experimenting with contemporary dance and theater, he's returned home: back to ballet. GIA KOURLAS

Nicolas Moufarrege was ahead of his time. Born in Egypt to Lebanese parents, he played a brief but pivotal role as critic, curator and artist in New York's 1980s East Village art scene before dying of AIDS-related complications in 1985, at the age of 36.
His hand-embroidered mash-ups of found and invented imagery presaged our post-Internet comfort with appropriation, as well as the strange courtship between digital and traditional crafts that's dominated so much art in the last two decades.
A memorable example in "Nicolas Moufarrege: Recognize My Sign," which travels this week from the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston to the Queens Museum, is a canvas on which Hokusai's "The Great Wave" threatens to drown a crying cartoon woman borrowed from Roy Lichtenstein. WILL HEINRICH

Film: All Mushrooms Are Magical in 'Fantastic Fungi'
Oct. 11; fantasticfungi.com .
Mushrooms, glorious mushrooms. We devour them. We fear them. We use them to treat ailments and to get high. But how much do we really know about them? Louie Schwartzberg's "Fantastic Fungi" is about to educate us.
Around 4.5 billion years ago, fungi climbed out of the sea to create the Earth's soil and set the stage for all of life. And now they're everywhere, with some 300 miles of fungi's underground threadlike network beneath each step we take. Those massive organisms, called mycelia, both decompose matter that would otherwise choke the planet and help trees exchange nutrients and communicate. "Mushrooms represent rebirth, rejuvenation, regeneration," says the mycologist Paul Stamets, noting how fungi-based technology can even decontaminate the environment.
Beautifully shot with dazzling time-lapse, mushroom-sprouting images, expert opinions from Michael Pollan, Eugenia Bone and Dr. Andrew Weil, and narration by Brie Larson, "Fantastic Fungi" is a mind-trip unto itself.
"Fantastic Fungi" opens in New York on Oct. 11, and across the country this fall. KATHRYN SHATTUCK
Classical Music: Justice and Peace at Carnegie
Oct. 11; carnegiehall.org .
For more than two decades, the Sphinx Organization has advocated for the work of underrepresented musicians of color. And its touring string ensemble, the Sphinx Virtuosi, continues to bring necessary diversity to major concert halls.
On Friday, the Virtuosi perform at Carnegie Hall, with a program that highlights the work of four black composers: Michael Abels, Philip Herbert, Xavier Foley and Damien Sneed. Tied to the "400 Years of Inequality" nationwide initiative -- which raises awareness about the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to Virginia in 1619 -- the concert includes a new work by Foley titled "For Justice and Peace" as well as the world premiere of a vocal suite by Sneed that explores the legacy of slavery in the Americas.

Pop: Paula Cole Back in the Spotlight
Oct. 10; lpr.com .
For many artists, winning a Grammy is a career highlight. For Paula Cole, the Best New Artist award she won in 1997 -- and the press she received because of it -- made clear just how little her artistry was understood by the public. Her satirical hit, "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone," was misread as anti-feminist, and as she became a target of misogynistic gibes, Cole briefly considered leaving the industry altogether.
In the decades since, she has continued making music, but adopted a lower profile. Though she's still known for early pop chart-toppers, including "I Don't Want to Wait" (the theme song of "Dawson's Creek"), Cole's heart has always been in the less radio-friendly sections of her catalog. Her recent work includes a collection of jazz covers, and her latest album, "Revolution," tackles a range of sociopolitical topics. On Thursday, she will perform at Manhattan's Le Poisson Rouge in support of the record. OLIVIA HORN

Texto completo: "He's a good storyteller. Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
Carl "Tinker" West, Bruce Springsteen's former manager
Bruce Springsteen has a story to tell.
That's one aspect of a young Springsteen that former manager Carl "Tinker" West noticed early on.
"He's a good storyteller," said West, who's also a giant in the surfing world thanks to his founding of Challenger Eastern Surfboards in Ocean Township. "Vini (Lopez of the future E Street Band) brought him over to the shop (in Ocean Township). He was a smart kid, sort of quiet and he wrote songs. I said, 'You just keep writing something, you guys rehearse — work here all day, make surfboards and rock 'n' roll.'"
That was the plan. It worked.
Springsteen has sold millions of records, plays to stadiums around the world, is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, all for his rock 'n' rolling.
Now Springsteen, who turned 70 on Sept. 23, he's in an era of new artistic pursuits, new creative formats. The latest is the movie "Western Stars," a filmed version of his latest album. He co-directed "Western Stars" with frequent collaborator Thom Zimny. The film features a performance of the folk-rock orchestral album, and vignettes starring a solo Springsteen.
The film follows the hit "Springsteen on Broadway," which featured the Boss baring his life story, set to song and remembrance. "Springsteen on Broadway" ran from October 2017 to December 2018.
The music play was based on his New York Times best-selling memoir "Born to Run," which was released in September 2016. Springsteen did a nine-city book tour, where he greeted thousands of fans in person for hours at a stretch in a feat of physical and mental stamina.
The Boss stood on a platform, under lights, while he met fans.
Cindy Marselis of Huntington Valley, Pennsylvania, was in tears after meeting Springsteen at the Freehold Barnes and Noble signing on Sept. 27, 2016.
"I met the person I always wanted to meet," said Marselis, at the signing. "I got to kiss him. It was awesome."
Springsteen is still telling stories, and still on stage. But now he's exploring new formats for the stories, and the stories he's telling are largely his own these days.
"I think he's said this before, but he truly envisions himself as an artist and I feel that all of these projects are in service of him wanting to tap into all of the different facets of who he is," said Caroline Madden, 26, of Toms River.
Madden is set to release a book on Springsteen's music in films and TV, "Springsteen as Soundtrack: The Sound of the Boss in Film and Television," from McFarland & Co. "That's why he's so unique and has endured as an artist for so long – he doesn't settle. He's always looking to renew himself or try something new."
West saw that creative energy up close when Springsteen fronted the band Steel Mill, which West managed and did sound for.
"I liked Springsteen because those guys would go in the back of the shop and they would rehearse," West said. "Vini Lopez, Danny Federici, they would write lots of music and whenever we'd get a couple of songs together that were pretty good, we'd go and try it out at Pandemonium, right at the bottom of Sunset Avenue."
The club was less than a mile from West's surfboard factory.
"What changes his music is that he wants to write something different," West said. "He writes some great stories. Stories to me are what makes great music, especially the early stuff. The first two albums ('Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.' and 'The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle'), people are still asking for those songs. Even so, he's written a lot of stuff after that's pretty damn good."
West and Springsteen's enduring friendship is explored in the book "Born to Run" and, subsequently in "Springsteen on Broadway." A highlight of the play is West, Springsteen and West's dog driving out west in West's 1950 Chevy flat-bed truck to play a concert and meet music industry contacts.
Springsteen didn't know how to drive until he drove the Chevy truck with West in the passenger seat. West still owns the truck.
"He knew what he wanted to do, I'm pretty sure," said West of Springsteen's artistic drive. "He wanted to wow an audience and he did. He had a great band. Federici was great. Lopez was great. Little Vinnie Roslin was great."
West used his connections and hustle to get a deal with Paramount Records.
"I finally found a deal that wouldn't screw him over," West said. "Then he said 'I don't want to do Steel Mill anymore.' (I said) That's up to you."
"I introduced him to Mike Appel. He introduced him to John Hammond and the rest is history," said West of Springsteen's subsequent manager and the of the famed Columbia Records talent scout. .
The stories Springsteen has been telling in recent years are stark, revealing and confessional.
"For a long time, if I loved you or if I felt a deep attachment to you, I would hurt you if I could," says Springsteen in "Western Stars."
He talked without censor of his troubled relationship with his father in "Springsteen on Broadway" and has been candid about his struggles with mental illness.
"I have come close enough to (mental illness) where I know I am not completely well myself," Springsteen previously told Esquire. "I've had to deal with a lot of it over the years, and I'm on a variety of medications that keep me on an even keel; otherwise I can swing rather dramatically and ... just ... the wheels can come off a little bit. So we have to watch, in our family. I have to watch my kids, and I've been lucky there. It ran in my family going way before my dad."
Springsteen is married to Patti Scialfa and they have three children, Evan, 29; Jessica, 27; and Sam, 25.
Springsteen's non-rock 'n' roll work of the past few years has also framed the aging process for fans. He's showing the way to baby boomers about what to do, how to do it, and what's important in life when you get to a certain age.
The fans of his generation might have looked to John Lennon for the answers, but he didn't get to grow old like Springsteen. Lennon would have been 78 if he were still alive.
"Aging is scary but fascinating, and great talent morphs in strange and often enlightening ways," said Springsteen in "Born to Run."
There no official events planned to recognize Springsteen's 70th birthday, but"Springsteen: His Hometown," an exhibit presented by the Monmouth County Historical Association and the Bruce Springsteen Archives and Center for American Music at Monmouth University, is now open at the historical association in Freehold. Ticket information is at www.SpringsteenHisHometown.com.
Preview showings of "Western Stars" are scheduled for Oct. 19 and 23 in area movie theaters. Visit www.fathomevents.com for more info and tickets.
As for the E Street Band, Springsteen ain't done yet, despite the success he's had with his new avenues of artistic expression.
"We want the band to get back together," Springsteen said to applause at the Toronto International Film Festival. "I've got some songs written for the band and I'd like to make a really good rock band record with the E Street Band.
"We'll be seeing you."

Texto completo: NEW YORK (AP) — Diahann Carroll, the Oscar-nominated actress and singer who won critical acclaim as the first black woman to star in a non-servant role in a TV series as "Julia," has died. She was 84.
Carroll’s daughter, Susan Kay, told The Associated Press her mother died Friday in Los Angeles of cancer.
During her long career, Carroll earned a Tony Award for the musical "No Strings" and an Academy Award nomination for "Claudine."
But she was perhaps best known for her pioneering work on "Julia." Carroll played Julia Baker, a nurse whose husband had been killed in Vietnam, in the groundbreaking situation comedy that aired from 1968 to 1971.
Although she was not the first black woman to star in her own TV show (Ethel Waters played a maid in the 1950s series "Beulah"), she was the first to star as someone other than a servant.
NBC executives were wary about putting "Julia" on the network during the racial unrest of the 1960s, but it was an immediate hit.
It had its critics, though, including some who said Carroll’s character, who is the mother of a young son, was not a realistic portrayal of a black American woman in the 1960s.
"They said it was a fantasy," Carroll recalled in 1998. "All of this was untrue. Much about the character of Julia I took from my own life, my family."
Not shy when it came to confronting racial barriers, Carroll won her Tony portraying a high-fashion American model in Paris who has a love affair with a white American author in the 1959 Richard Rodgers musical "No Strings." Critic Walter Kerr described her as "a girl with a sweet smile, brilliant dark eyes and a profile regal enough to belong on a coin."
She appeared often in plays previously considered exclusive territory for white actresses: "Same Time, Next Year," ‘’Agnes of God" and "Sunset Boulevard" (as faded star Norma Desmond, the role played by Gloria Swanson in the 1950 film.) "I like to think that I opened doors for other women, although that wasn’t my original intention," she said in 2002.
Her film career was sporadic. She began with a secondary role in "Carmen Jones" in 1954 and five years later appeared in "Porgy and Bess," although her singing voice was dubbed because it wasn’t considered strong enough for the Gershwin opera. Her other films included "Goodbye Again," "Hurry Sundown," "Paris Blues," and "The Split."
The 1974 film "Claudine" provided her most memorable role. She played a hard-bitten single mother of six who finds romance in Harlem with a garbage man played by James Earl Jones.
In the 1980s, she appeared in the long-running prime-time soap opera "Dynasty" for three years. More recently, she had a number of guest shots and small roles in TV series, including playing the mother of Isaiah Washington’s character, Dr. Preston Burke, on "Grey’s Anatomy."
She also returned to her roots in nightclubs. In 2006, she made her first club appearance in New York in four decades, singing at Feinstein’s at the Regency. Reviewing a return engagement in 2007, a New York Times critic wrote that she sang "Both Sides Now" with "the reflective tone of a woman who has survived many severe storms and remembers every lightning flash and thunderclap."

Why does everyone want to write a book?

Texto completo: Writers’ workshops are popping up everywhere.
Some, like Inlandia Institute’s workshops around the Inland Empire, are free, sponsored by Inlandia’s donors and philanthropic organizations. Others are hosted by celebrity authors or internet bloggers, such as Elizabeth Gilbert, Joyce Maynard and Dani Shapiro. A recent New York Times Style section reported on the proliferation of celebrity-run workshops that cost hundreds — even thousands — of dollars and take place in venues as disparate as New York City and San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.
Why are these workshops — free or expensive — finding so many takers? It’s quite possible that rubbing elbows with celebrities motivates some who pay up for Maynard’s or Shapiro’s sessions. But it’s certainly not why about 120 people have come to my free or low-cost Inlandia workshops over the past three years.
For them, I believe the motivation comes from a need to tell stories.
In my memoir-writing workshops, I sense an urgency to be heard, read and remembered by their children and grandchildren. Since most of my participants are at least as old as I am (mid-60s), I understand the urgency: There’s no time like the present. In fact, we may have no time other than the present.
But even my fiction-writing participants feel compelled to tell stories. Their ages spread across generations — currently, my workshop at the Palm Springs Public Library comprises 14 writers, ages 25 to 91. I believe my 91 year old will live well past 100, given his health and energy, and my 25 year old is certainly not contemplating an imminent demise. That’s not the source of their urgency.
Some people suggest people hope to make money writing now that real jobs (not gigs) are harder to find. If that were the case, they would be quickly disabused of that fantasy. The average full-time novelist makes somewhere around $6,000 a year — not a living wage.
Authors, essayists and academics have written books about humans as “storytelling animals.” They argue that we teach by telling stories, we make excuses for ourselves by telling stories and we grab the limelight by telling stories. We learn by hearing stories, and we empathize by listening to stories. Stories are the means by which we entertain ourselves, share our humanity, make friends and construct arguments.
So, why this sudden rush to write them down?
I believe the urgency to write isn’t about money or time, it’s about a pent-up supply of stories to tell. My husband and I once lived in a tree-lined neighborhood in Denver, in a house with a fine front porch that comfortably accommodated us and our two dogs plus a couple of neighbors or passersby. Nearly every night when the weather was amenable, we sat out there with a beer or a glass of wine, and talked with friends and complete strangers. I doubt that we were aware of it at the time, but as I look back, I realize this was our story-telling hour. We told stories about our days and about our lives, and we listened to stories. It was an essential part of our day, and when the weather turned bad, our cabin-fever was at least in part a result of the isolation that the snow, ice and cold caused and the hiatus in our story-telling hour.
We no longer have such a front porch, and neither do most Americans. And those who do may sit out on the step for days without anyone wandering by or coming out of the house across the street. Most of us are inside watching “Game of Thrones,” playing video games or Googling. While all of those activities are about story, as well, most of us are passive, not active participants in the telling. We’re not asked to tell a story — we’re just asked to listen. Our extended families are spread across the country — if not the globe — as well. We see them rarely, and most of our communications are via Facebook or Instagram, neither of which lend themselves to in-depth story telling.
In some towns, including Palm Springs where I live, community organizations have initiated storytelling events where people are coached and encouraged to stand up and tell stories to a receptive audience of their peers. But clearly, these programs can’t soak up all of the desire to tell stories, and hence, writers’ workshops proliferate.
Perhaps some of the current popularity of writing workshops has to do with self-publishing — now made easy by the likes of Kindle Direct Publishing, Ingram Spark and Lulu. Anyone can write a story and make a book these days; we don’t have to wait for a big publishing house in New York or London to grant us permission. And Joe Moran, author of the recently published book “First You Write a Sentence,” suggests that computers and printers produce pretty pages, which encourages everyone — regardless of the quality of the sentences — to think they’re a bona fide “writer.”
But, I believe this rush to write stories has more to do with our technology-inspired isolation than technology-inspired hubris. We want to tell each other stories, and we want our stories to be heard.

Texto completo: President Donald Trump’s latest assault on immigration, cutting the number of refugees accepted to a mere 18,000 from 30,000 last year, is better than the complete ban that some of his aides were seeking. But looking at mere numbers misses the point.
This is the administration’s latest message to anyone dreaming of a freer life in America: that they should just stay away. The Trump administration has systematically acted to bar as many refugees and asylum seekers as possible, virtually from its first day, supplanting America’s traditional welcome to the world’s desperate people with a spirit of xenophobia and bigotry.
Led by Stephen Miller, a zealot who has planted lieutenants throughout the government, the Trump White House has made its anti-immigration campaign something akin to a crusade, with “the wall” along the Mexican border as its symbol.
The administration has tried to scare away Central Americans by separating children from their parents when families arrive at the border seeking asylum; it threatened to end “temporary protected status” for people escaping natural and other disasters in a number of countries, including Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan; it suspended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which let undocumented immigrants who arrived here as children stay and work; it has dramatically deported immigrants without regard for their ties to family and community; and it has enacted a system that would prevent migrants from seeking asylum if they passed through another country without first seeking asylum there.
Any question about the mind-set guiding the administration should have been put to rest by Trump’s icy explanation to reporters last month for why he was barring residents of the hurricane-battered Bahamas from taking refuge in the United States.
“I don’t want to allow people that weren’t supposed to be in the Bahamas to come into the United States, including some very bad people and some very bad gang members, and some very, very bad drug dealers,” he said. He offered not a shred of proof of any such danger, while the shattering evidence of Bahamians’ needs still lies everywhere.
The limit announced by the State Department on Sept. 26 is far below the 110,000 refugees a year that President Barack Obama said in 2016 should be let in. Most of the 18,000 slots, moreover, are already filled by Iraqis who worked with the American military, victims of religious persecution and some Central Americans. That would leave only 7,500 slots for families seeking unification, like parents of Rohingya children who have already been admitted.
The proffered reason for the cut was the huge backlog in immigration courts as the number of people seeking asylum is expected to reach 350,000. Most refugees trying to enter the United States, though, have already been cleared. So it’s not immediately clear how lowering the annual limit will help ease the backlog.
There are enormous backlogs, and the United States cannot let in everyone who wants to come. But the severity of the cutbacks makes clear that the administration’s rationale hides its real motive: to score political points with a base of voters fearful of immigration by seeming to keep out as many people as possible.
This shortsighted politicking denies a fundamental virtue — and key advantage — of America’s democracy: that it is a land of immigrants and refugees. It ignores the contributions of immigrants to the greatness of the United States.
There is no sensible argument for opening the borders to everyone. Any refugee or asylum program needs a solid vetting process. But Trump’s approach is not the answer. Congress should have stepped in long ago with serious immigration reform. But that failure is no reason for Americans to be taken in by Trump’s fear-mongering and evasive explanations.

Texto completo: Our monthly selection of the most interesting shows.
Several new podcasts have quickly earned popularity on podcast charts. Top of the Apple charts this month is NBC News's newest venture into audio, "The Thing About Pam," from Keith Morrison and the "Dateline" team, which demonstrates corporate media's continued experimentation with the audio-only form. But here are some other newcomers that could be worth your time -- whether you're a musical kid, a lover of mafia history, a cosmic believer, curious about classical music, concerned about gentrification and the environment or a Phishhead.
'The Music Box'
'Pitch It'
There are about four million children in the U.S. who don't have access to music teachers, according to the trailer for "The Music Box." This podcast, a production of Louisville Public Media, is here to change that. Revamped from its first season as a classical music education podcast after going through PRX's Project Catapult, a podcast training project for public media stations, "The Music Box" is now a short and delightful children's music 101 class in a podcast. This season Mr. Arthur -- your new favorite music teacher -- leads lessons in timbre, beat, rhythm and pitch. The under-10 minute episodes are interactive and accessible, compelling kids and adults alike to participate by responding and performing along with the class.
'School Colors'
'Old School'
This is a tale of two schools. They're both in School District 16 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. In fact, they're on the same street: Marcus Garvey Boulevard. One has a waiting list of people scrambling to get their child admitted, while the other one is only at a quarter of its capacity and is threatening to close. "School Colors" is an eight-part documentary from Brooklyn Deep that explores the emotions and politics surrounding gentrification. The two hosts are Mark Winston Griffith, a community organizer, journalist and Brooklyn native, and Max Freedman, a teacher, audio producer and self-admitted gentrifier. Together they tell the story of a neighborhood grappling with race, class and power on the battleground of its schools. They interview parents and students, teachers and politicians, and landlords and activists to illuminate a thorny urban upheaval happening across the country.
'Adult ISH'
'Broke ISH'
"Adult ISH," created by YR Media, has joined forces with Radiotopia for the second season of this weekly storytelling and conversation podcast that's made for and by Generation Z. Nyge Turner and Merk Nguyen, both 22, host round table discussions, interviews and advice sessions about the concerns of young people today: debt, sexual health, depression, cannabis, cuffing season. They also take deeper dives into their own stories that bring more serious moments, like being the only black people on a plantation tour or dealing with your immigrant parents' expectations and cultural differences. While aimed squarely at the current generation finding their adult footing, the hosts are ebullient enough and the conversation smart enough that any-stage adult could enjoy.
'On the Green Fence'
'Not Having Children to Save the World'
The German podcast market has been growing tremendously in the last few years and fortunately for Americans, Germans are eager to use podcasts to practice their English. Enter the German international broadcasting company Deutsche Welle, and its new English- language climate podcast, "On the Green Fence." The show follows two decidedly-not environmental journalists as they chase down leads about average Europeans who are, in their own small ways, trying to live a more eco-friendly life. They weigh both sides of wildlife reintroduction arguments, interview youth about the voluntarily child-free movement to lower carbon footprints, and go dumpster diving to discover the hypocrisy of laws that make throwing large amounts of perfectly consumable food away legal, but fishing around in the trash for them illegal. Their lack of expertise, self-critical reflection on their own carbon footprints and goofy blunders makes this kind of climate reporting fun.
'Mob Queens'
'Who Is Anna Genovese?'
Though American culture romanticizes the mafia as an American dream story, too little attention is paid to the other half of that romance: the unsung women who often held "the family" and its business operations together. Stitcher's "Mob Queens," made by Jessica Bendinger, the writer of "Bring It On," and Michael Seligman, a writer and producer for "RuPaul's Drag Race," focuses its first season on Anna Genovese -- wife of "King of the Underworld" and ruthless Mafia boss Vito -- who proves a fascinating figure in her own right. The hosts trawl government archives to piece together her story, review testimony from informants and interview family members and remaining witnesses. They climb treacherous tenement stairs in Little Italy to the spot where Anna's first husband was whacked; two weeks later Vito "dragged" her to the altar. Or was she part of the hit? Later they unearth the drag club she ran and learn about the post-prohibition need for mafia-run gay bars (serving anyone perceived homosexual was illegal). The result is a rich picture of a New Yorker who was far more than just a "mob wife."
'Horoscope Today'
'Welcome to Libra Today'
Spotify has released a suite of daily podcasts that are tailored to where the planets were when you were born. Its "Horoscope Today" feed promises to "help you find your place in the universe" in three minutes or less. For whatever reason you might be into them, you know that a daily horoscope update can help contextualize the moods and events of your day -- or be so off-base it makes you laugh. While there is absolutely an app for that, consider adding your sign's episode to your morning podcast routine.
Each sign has its own feed featuring guidance and affirmations tailored specifically to a sign's quirks and values. Go to Spotify's "Horoscope Today" landing page to listen to your sign's welcome. If it sounds like you, click through to your sign's podcast for your individual daily feed (Virgos, I got us). If it doesn't sound like you, try your rising or moon signs. Even if you're a skeptic, as the host airily intones, "you may be surprised by the knowledge the stars impart."
'The Open Ears Project'
'On Resetting Your Day'
"The Open Ears Project" is an aural experiment of sorts. It's playing with the daily show form cornered by the news media, but using it for something far less anxiety-inducing. For 30 days, WNYC Studios and the New York classical music station WQXR is releasing a daily meditation exploring the emotional impact of classical music. The goal is to reveal the empathetic appeal of the music, rather than the "intellectual," and break down the barriers that make classical music seem inaccessible. Episodes have featured the jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, the musician Jon Batiste, the opera singer Jamie Barton and other entertainers, but also a firefighter who cleared rubble at Ground Zero, a children's book author and a comedian. After they explain why an individual piece of music means so much to them, the piece is played on its own, The quiet joy of the show can also be spread outside of your podcast listening app, as the collaborators have made a Spotify playlist of all of the picks, as have the fans.
'Long May They Run'
'A Pattern Language'
This new music documentary series from C13 Orginals focuses on bands and artists that have influenced broader music culture. Their first season is all about Phish, a touring giant of the industry. "Long May They Run" features history and legend, audio from live-performance moments (flying hot dogs, anyone?), and interviews with band members and their fans. The season explores the decisions behind many of the industry innovations Phish helped pioneer -- like self-produced multiday music festivals and direct-to-fan ticketing.

Texto completo: An imagined conversation between Flyover Man and Urban Guy.
URBAN GUY: I hope you read the rough transcript of that Trump phone call with the Ukrainian president. Trump clearly used public power to ask a foreign leader to dig up dirt on his political opponent. This is impeachable. I don’t see how you can deny the facts in front of your face.
FLYOVER MAN: I haven’t really had time to look into it. There’s always some fight between Trump and the East Coast media. I guess I just try to stay focused on the big picture.
The big picture is this: We knew this guy was a snake when we signed up. But he was the only one who saw us. He was the only one who saw that the America we love is being transformed in front of our eyes. Good jobs for hardworking people were gone. Our communities in tatters. Our kids in trouble. I had one shot at change, so I made a deal with the devil, and you’d have made it, too.
Nothing in this impeachment mess makes me rethink this bargain. If people like you are unable to acknowledge my dignity and see my problems, I’ll stay with Trump.
U.G.: The big picture? The big picture is the U.S. Constitution. It’s no man is above the law. We can’t live in a country in which our leaders flagrantly commit high crimes and nothing happens.
F.M.: I get it. He said some stupid crap on a phone call. But are you going to undo my vote for that? I wouldn’t even rank this among the top 25 worst things he’s done, and I’m a supporter of his!
Listen, do you remember those months just after the election when people like you were briefly curious about people like me? You sent your reporters out on wild safaris into the hinterlands to interview Trump voters. You read “Hillbilly Elegy.” Back then it was fashionable to say that Trump is just a symptom of real problems in America. He’s the wrong answer to the right question.
It didn’t take you long to lose interest in all that. Now we’re just a block of concrete you call “his base.” Now, all you care about is Trump, not his supporters or the issues driving us. Your whole media is Trump-O-Centric.
U.G.: We became Trump-O-Centric because his daily outrages undermine norms, spread xenophobia, degrade public morality.
F.M.: You think that because you have the kind of jobs that allow you to follow Twitter all day. I don’t have that luxury. So all that passing nonsense seems far away. I have to deal with the actual realities of life.
One, mass immigration is changing my town, region and state. Two, the cultural liberalism you preach but don’t practice is leading to the breakdown of families up and down my block. Children out of wedlock. Young men with no dad when they’re young and no wife in their life when they’re grown. Third, an Ivy League elite running government and the economy for itself and shutting out those of us who actually make things with our hands. Fourth, China is replacing us.
U.G.: I’m happy to talk about these big problems.
F.M.: Like hell you are. The media fixates on scandals because they’re easier to talk about than complex issues like why urban and rural America are drifting further apart. You wasted billions of hours speculating about the Mueller report, and now news about Adam Schiff overshadows everything else while my world burns. Let’s face it: Bashing Trump is the media’s business model. That’s what drives eyeballs and profit.
U.G.: We can’t have a productive conversation with Trump around. He lies with abandon. He slanders and insults. He pollutes the water near and far.
F.M.: We can’t have productive conversations if every time I open my mouth you call me a bigot. You may not realize this, but you have Trump supporters around you all the time. It’s just that we’ve learned to keep our mouths shut in your presence. The crushing climate of blue cultural privilege is too strangulating.
U.G.: OK, I get it. You’re not the first person to spin the right-wing victim narrative in front of me. Why don’t we focus on impeachment? On rule of law.
F.M.: Fine. Bottom line: I would be open to impeachment if you cared about my problems. I’d be open if all those silent Republican dissenters in the Senate had given me some GOP alternative candidate who speaks our language and addresses our issues. I’d be open if there was a moderate Democratic Party that I thought deserved a shot. But I only see Democrats who’d make everything worse: Open the border! Socialism! More power to Washington! You could have paid attention to the forces driving Trumpism, but you ignored us.
So please don’t ask us to sign up for our own obliteration or support your impeachment. This is about identity and pride.
Here’s a confession. I used to think Trump was a jerk. Now, after three years of battle, I see him as my captain. He deserves my loyalty, thick and thin.
See ya’ in hell, brother.

Woodward weighs in at Whitworth Legendary reporter talks Trump, impeachment, journalistic ethics

Texto completo: Hours after President Donald Trump publicly urged China and Ukraine to investigate a political rival, legendary journalist Bob Woodward wanted to talk to Whitworth students about coffee.
One of the reporters credited with unveiling the Watergate scandal told a packed room of about 200 students and faculty that his career almost ended with a mistake made in his early days at the Washington Post.
Woodward was reporting that a prestigious hotel's cafe had failed a health inspection, but an editor told him to get his "fat rear off the chair" and actually go to the coffee shop.
When he got to the hotel, he recalled, he asked, "Where's the coffee shop?" And the answer was, "We don't have one."
The 76-year-old Pulitzer Prize winner quickly pivoted from that nearly libelous report to the current occupant of the White House and to his belief that Trump's actions have not risen to the level of those that drove President Richard Nixon from office.
But, Woodward said, Trump is inching closer.
"It gets more serious each day," Woodward said Thursday morning, referencing Trump urging other countries to investigate the activities of Joe Biden's son.
"Impeachment, which of course is the charge from the House of Representatives, is almost certainly going to happen to Trump," Woodward predicted. "But then there's a trial in the Senate."
Woodward shared stories about writing "Fear: Trump in the White House," his latest book on the presidency. The book takes its name from a quote Trump gave Woodward and reporter Robert Costa when he was just a candidate for the presidency in March 2016.
"Real power - I don't even want to use the word - fear," Trump said in a quote that's on the book's dust jacket.
"It's great to have a title that comes from your subject directly," Woodward said.
With the release of "Fear" last September, Woodward published a book about his ninth White House - and broke a sales record in the process. And he hinted to the audience he isn't done yet.
"I'm working on a second book now, and I'm going through interviews with Trump, looking for one word that can be the title for the second book," Woodward said. "I think I've found it, but I'm not going to say."
Students questioned Woodward not only about the presidency, but also about his role as a journalist in a changing media landscape.
One student asked Woodward how he would feel if the president characterized him as "a spy," considering the combative way Trump has dealt with the press and with the whistleblower who raised concerns about a phone call the president had with the Ukrainian president this summer.
Woodward paused, looking at Whitworth University President Beck Taylor and the audience.
"Uh, thank you," Woodward said and turned to Taylor, as the audience laughed. "You said this was going to be a tough afternoon."
After the event, Woodward said he was hoping the talk would be educational for students, by giving them a look into his experience writing "Fear" and the pieces for the Washington Post that eventually became the definitive account of the Watergate scandal.
"I tried to tell some war stories, and talk about things that are lessons," Woodward told The Spokesman-Review.
Woodward also addressed concerns about his appearance Wednesday as the moderator of a discussion with New York Times investigative reporters Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, who authored a book about allegations of sexual assault and harassment made against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Attendees booed and heckled Woodward for interrupting the women when they were speaking, and his approach prompted an outcry on Twitter over what some saw as his disrespectful interviewing style.
"They said the questions were fabulous, the Me Too people," Woodward said. "Katherine Graham, the editor of the Post, said sometimes we're going to ask things, and we're going to write about things, that some people don't like. That's part of the process."
Luke Burns, a senior communications major from Camas, Washington, asked Woodward to reflect on how his involvement in the political process changed his outlook on his life's purpose. Woodward served in the U.S. Navy and wrote for a weekly before joining the Washington Post in 1971.
Woodward again paused.
"Do you major in psychiatry?" Woodward asked, to laughter.
The journalist responded that he'd been put in a unique position through his life's work, and told a story about pestering administration officials at home at all hours and convincing them to talk about uncomfortable subjects.
Burns said he appreciated the inside look at the reporting process, but was hoping for a more introspective response from Woodward.
"I was trying to get more of a personal answer," Burns said.
Others said they appreciated Woodward's talk, which was promoted by Taylor and faculty members in multiple departments. Teachers lined the back of the room in the Hixson Union Building, the chairs mostly occupied by students.
"I think he was honestly revealing what he knows to be true about Trump and current events," said Laura Waltar, a junior in peace studies and a campus spiritual life coordinator from Leavenworth, Washington.
Woodward at times offered criticism of the Trump White House, describing the president as "so infatuated with his own instincts" that he isolates himself from advisers and saying he is singularly focused on feeding what Woodward called a "boiling ego."
But Woodward also praised the president for "being very skeptical of war."
Ashlie Loring, a senior in international studies from Albania, said that despite the criticism of Trump, she didn't believe Woodward's talk was too political.
"It's hard not to be political. Bipartisanship is dead, right?" said Loring, who serves as communications specialist for the Dornsife Center for Community Engagement at Whitworth. "I don't think he was (political). I think he was talking from personal experience."
That emphasis on using firsthand knowledge to tell political stories was key to the message Woodward left with the audience.
In a time when the press is under attack from positions of power, Woodward said the industry has to "walk the painful road of introspection." That started by getting out and talking to people, and verifying information. Just as he did with the coffee shop, years ago.
"We're not showing up," Woodward said of his fellow journalists. "We're hampering ourselves by not showing up."
Woodward will speak in Spokane again today, as part of Whitworth University's President's Leadership Forum. The public event will be held at the Spokane Convention Center and is open to the public. It is sold out.

Texto completo: I'm a lipstick-wearing, red-meat-eating, Diet Coke-drinking, heterosexual, cis-gender patriotic American feminist of Sicilian and French-Canadian descent who can recite both "Who's On First?" and "Little Women" in their entirety without breaking a sweat.
I don't like beer, scented candles, pie or sports, I prefer cats to dogs, and I drive a classic non-fuel-efficient convertible, which my husband of 28 years and I often take to the casino. I believe in a woman's right to choose and hope that God loves me, even though I'm not sure I believe God exists in the first place.
So what part of that made you want to throw me into the alligator moat? Was it my use of the term "cis-gender"? Wearing lipstick or wanting women to have health care? The mention of God alongside a confession of wavering belief?
It was preferring cats to dogs, wasn't it?
Here's what I have to guard against doing these days: I sweep too swiftly past a cursory acknowledgment of differences between people in search of consecrating divisions. I find myself gathering up reasons to distinguish my own clan from rival ones as if I'm working a pyramid scheme in reverse. I'm an omnivore; she's a vegetarian. I'm letting our differences define us.
How can she NOT understand this point I'm making? What is WRONG with her? She, of course, is thinking the same about me. Or at least, that's what I fear - I am, I suppose, easy to judge, if you're so inclined. Not exactly a woman of mystery.
Is it surprising, then, that I hesitate to discuss significant issues with those whose viewpoints I don't think align with my own? Even when we're on the same side, we can end up yelling at each other with a level of viciousness usually reserved for drivers vying for the same parking space if one little piece of their worldview seems slightly askew.
Political discourse has become an oxymoron; nothing is off-limits; rhetoric has been replaced by rock-throwing. Everything encourages us to regard those who aren't with us as against us, and to judge them as treasonous, sinister, desperate or - dare I say? - deplorable.
Then I - and we, yes, I'm going with "we" - unearth justifications for our point of view the way hounds hunt for bones. (It's not that I don't like dogs, you see; it's just that I really like cats.) It's not enough to feel we're right: we want to prove we're right, to ourselves as much as to anyone else (maybe more so). That's why we find ourselves becoming positively evangelical about things we know are none of our business, such as who eats what and who sleeps with whom.
Our beliefs define us. And who wants to be undefined in today's world? So we scrape together convenient truths and build our identities out of them.
A recent article by Gina Kolata in the New York Times, for example, follows the uproar over new scientific evidence suggesting that, despite years of being lectured about the damage a single sausage could cause our overall well-being, "an individual cannot conclude that he or she will be better off not eating red meat" based on existing studies.
Heads of major schools of medicine are weighing in; those studying the climate are weighing in; I'm weighing in (or to be more precise, weighing the locally farmed steaks we're grilling this weekend).
We're having the fillets with home-schooled potatoes, though, because I'm not part of the cult where carbohydrates are seen as the food of the devil. The Paleos treat carbs the way the Puritans treated witches: Dunk them in water, and if they bob to the surface, they must be evil and destroyed. "Get thee behind me, pasta!" cry the Paleos as they recoil, secretly worried that they'll be tempted despite repeatedly whispering "hunger is part of the transition." Truly a tribe of renown, but definitely not my tribe.
If we're in danger of losing our souls, it's not because of what we're putting into our mouths - it's because we're being driven by our guts and not our brains. We push away ideas that aren't form-fitted into our existing biases with the gesture a toddler uses to reject food she's never tasted. But as adults, we justify our uninformed instincts and hunker down in our original positions, shaking our heads without noticing there's an empty sound where original thought should be.
When we encounter a space we haven't yet filled with bias and belief, it gets filled with alligators and other monsters, making us wary and frightened. We don't know where to find comfort. We don't know who counts as a true ally or a genuine friend. Lonely and bereft, we're tempted to become part of a mob just to be able to hang out with people.
It doesn't have to be that way.
Community calls for compromise and trust. I'll cook a vegan lasagna and somebody else can grill while, in the background, the baseball game plays, and your puppy runs in the yard, and people talk with patience and curiosity about their politics and personal choices, unburdened by prefabricated groupthink. The devil, bored, goes searching for beer, while God - who may or may not exist - lies half-listening in the hammock. As I start reciting "Little Women," everybody quickly packs up to home.
It could be worse: There's actually plenty of beer.

Texto completo: Bayonet-armed troops nixed, but aides carried out other Trump plans
President Trump told aides last year that he wanted U.S. forces with bayonets to block people from crossing into the United States across the Mexican border, one of several proposals he floated at moments of peak frustration with his inability to contain a migration surge, according to current and former administration officials involved in those discussions.
Trump also suggested the excavation of a border trench, or moat, that could be stocked with dangerous reptiles, the officials said, adding that such ideas, along with the bayonets, were not taken especially seriously by aides in the White House.
The New York Times reported Tuesday on Trump's proposal for a moat filled with snakes and alligators, along with his suggestion that U.S. forces could open fire on migrants as they attempted to enter the country, potentially shooting at their legs to wound but not kill them.
The president denied those claims in a tweet Wednesday. "Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes, with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top, at our Southern Border," he wrote. "I may be tough on Border Security, but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!"
The Washington Post independently confirmed that the president did, in fact, say those things during border security meetings, including at moments when he demanded the wholesale closure of the U.S.-Mexico border and appeared prepared to enforce the decree with violence.
Deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley declined to comment on the president's suggestions, alleging that "there have been so many wild, inaccurate and offensive fake news characterizations" surrounding his desires. Gidley said Trump has made clear that he wants to secure the border; Trump made immigration and border security a central issue of his first presidential campaign and of his tenure in the White House.
The idea for the bayonets surfaced about the time the president began sending U.S. soldiers to the border last year, according one of the officials involved in the discussions. The official, like others in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about internal discussions.
At the time, then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis did not want U.S. soldiers to interact directly with migrants, and he did not want them to be armed while taking on the mission. The deployment fell short of providing Trump with the kind of intimidating show of force he was seeking.
Staffers advised the president that it would be illegal to use bayonets against migrant families crossing the border, and they warned that the deployment of such weapons would trigger a backlash. The officials said it was not clear whether Trump sought to have U.S. soldiers wield the bayonets, or if border agents would carry them. The idea went nowhere.
"Trump would be throwing extremes at the wall when he was frustrated," said one former official, who, like others, characterized some of Trump's suggestions as fanciful musings aides did not interpret as serious directives.
The United States already has a natural waterway along nearly two-thirds of the U.S.-Mexico border - the Rio Grande - and its lower section is a habitat for alligators, as well as venomous snakes.
That river, in places murky and with a deceptively strong current, has proved deadly to some migrants who have tried to wade, swim or boat across it in the hope of reaching the Texas shoreline.
Aides who participated in the meetings or who were later briefed said Homeland Security staffers and White House aides typically divided the president's proposals into two categories.
Those considered the most extreme - alligators and gunfire - were not acted upon, but other proposals were taken more seriously or implemented, including Trump's request to paint the border barrier black and top it with sharpened spikes that could inflict injury.
Trump has boasted that the black paint absorbs heat from the desert sun and makes the barrier hot to the touch.
U.S. soldiers were ordered to paint a one-mile span of border fencing in California's Imperial Valley this summer, coating the steel with a specific shade of black the president favored, at a cost of $1 million. More recently, Trump has spoken favorably of the "anti-climb" steel panels that are fixed at the top of the barrier's newest spans, which he said can only be defeated by "world-class mountain climbers."
After Trump took office, arrests along the border fell to their lowest levels in more than 50 years, but migration levels began rising again soon after. The arrival of several large caravan groups during 2018 deepened the president's frustration, and an unprecedented number of Central American families crossed the border, many of them surrendering to authorities to seek humanitarian protection.
Trump's exasperation at the soaring migration numbers was compounded by his inability to quickly build his promised border wall and design it to his liking, particularly as Democrats blocked funding and sparred with him during last winter's partial government shutdown.
When then-DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other senior officials explained that U.S. agents were required by law to process the asylum claims of migrants seeking protection once they reached U.S. territory, the president was determined to keep them out at all costs, one senior administration official said.
"The goal was to prevent them from ever setting foot on U.S. soil," the official said. "There was definitely a belief that you could put a line of people across the entry line and say 'you could not enter.' "
The president wanted U.S. forces - soldiers or border agents - to form a human wall at bridges and official ports of entry. "The thing that was explained to him was that even if they set one pinkie toe on U.S. soil, they will get all the rights and protections of a U.S. citizen who has been here 100 years," the official said.
Although Trump's proposal to use live fire was dismissed, the idea appears to have stuck with him, and he has argued that police have the right to fire when criminals attempt to flee from arrest. During a May rally in Florida, he told supporters that U.S. agents were not allowed to use their weapons against migrants, drawing a cry of "shoot them!" from someone in the crowd.
"That's only in the Panhandle you can get away with that statement," he said.
The Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the act of fleeing alone did not justify the use of deadly force by police. In doing so, the court struck down a Tennessee law allowing a police officer to "use all the necessary means to effect the arrest" of a suspect who was fleeing or forcibly resisting arrest.
Police officers can use deadly force, however, if they have a reasonable belief that the fleeing person poses an immediate risk to the safety of officers or other people. For example, if a fleeing suspect were carrying a gun, that would generally represent such a threat and the use of lethal force would probably be justified.
In a subsequent case, the court ruled that determining whether an officer has used excessive force depends on the facts of each case, "including the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest."

Texto completo: Listeners hungry for Sturgill Simpson's familiar croon better keep feasting on the old stuff – because the Kentucky songwriter's new album trades country comfort for all-out helping of rock 'n' roll grime.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer. Instead, he ventures deep into the underbelly of fuzzy, futuristic guitar rock.
Simpson recorded "Sound & Fury" at Michigan's McGuire Motor Inn, working alongside bandmates Bobby Emmett, Chuck Bartels and Miles Miller. John Hill, known for his work with Portugal. The Man and Cage The Elephant, co-produced the album.
And, if Simpson tapping into a no-nonsense dystopian soundscape wasn't enough, Simpson teamed with leading names in anime to team the 40-minute stack of new tunes with a Netflix film of the same name.
How's the album sound? And what can you expect from the Netflix film? Here's what we know about "Sound & Fury."
'Sound & Fury,' the album Simpson's 10-track "Sound & Fury" follows the subtle country storytelling of 2016's "A Sailor's Guide To Earth," which earned the major label newcomer international acclaim – including an unexpected nomination for Album of the Year at the 2017 Grammy Awards (he'd fall to Adele, but brought home Best Country Album that year).
As outlined in a New York Times profile earlier this month, Simpson found "Sound & Fury" by way of Nashville nonconformity, worn-down months on the road ("There was a point in 2017 where I thought I was just going to just go away," he said) and the immobile weeks after a sinus surgery that led him to rediscover the music of his formidable years.
In his time recovering from surgery, Simpson told Apple Music's Zane Lowe that he turned to hip-hop, the Cars and Black Sabbath, each influencing the rip-roaring sound that boils with audacity and swagger on "Sound & Fury."
A cathartic output, Simpson told the Times he wanted it to hit "like a Wu-Tang record." From the article:
"I could've very easily probably made the same record five times by now and just gone right down that middle lane and played it safe, and I'd have $80 million in the bank," Simpson said, dryly. "And I'd probably be hanging from a (expletive) rope on one of these trees over here by now, you know what I mean? So it's not worth it."
The result? A sonic onslaught that explores galaxies between genre.
Simpson blurs between disco itches and gritty guitar scratches on the album. There's the groove of instrumental opener, "Ronin;" The slick, funky flair of "A Good Look;" southern-soaked bombast with closer "Fastest Horse In Town;" and an ode to longing, reflective guitar-pop with six-minute album standout "Make Art Not Friends."
On the subtly spacey "Mercury In Retrograde," Simpson sings to the dog-and-pony show that once greeted his rising success: "They come back stage and on my bus, pretending to be my friend/ Shaking hands behind grandstands, wearing the same 'ole grin."
The songs come from "a weird spot," Simpson told Lowe earlier this year – including his distaste for the industry behind the art.
"It is a dirty toxic industry," he said. "And I wanted to express a lot of that."
'Sound & Fury,' the film A 41-minute "Sound & Fury" anime epic, now streaming on Netflix, puts colorful (and unapologetically violent) context to the album.
Simpson, a Navy veteran once stationed in Japan, enlisted acclaimed creative Jumpei Mizusaki to direct, with "Afro Samauri" creator Takashi Okazaki serving as character designer.
The film draws blood-soaked lines between good and evil, a tension illuminated by dystopian chemicals and city-sprawling guerrilla warfare.
It took about $1.2 million to produce, the Times reported and follows "hegemonic structures, politics, corruption, greed – you know, things that usually lead to really (expletive) music," Simpson said.
On his new album "Sound & Fury," Sturgill Simpson steps firmly away from the outlaw country sound where some once considered him a torchbearer.

Texto completo: Three weeks after his most recent novel, "The Institute," was published, Stephen King has announced yet another book to be published in 2020.
"If It Bleeds," set to come out May 5, 2020, is a collection of four novellas -- like classic King books "Different Seasons, "Four Past Midnight" and "Full Dark, No Stars,"
There have been few details released by King's publisher, Scribner/Simon & Schuster, but cover art for the book was revealed on Thursday, as well as two paragraphs from an as-yet untitled novella, which Entertainment Weekly posted Thursday. In that excerpt, both Ralph Anderson from "The Outsider" and King favorite character Holly Gibney are mentioned.
"The Institute," which came out Sept. 10, debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list and is at No. 2 during its third week out. It will mark an unbroken 10-year streak for King of releasing at least one novel or collection each year, beginning in 2011.
"If It Bleeds" will be King's 62nd novel or collection of novellas or stories.

Texto completo: Bernie Sanders will participate in the Oct. 15 Democratic presidential primary debate despite canceling campaign events so he can recover from an unexpected heart procedure, campaign officials said Thursday.
The Vermont senator, 78, experienced "chest discomfort" during a campaign event in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Doctors discovered a blockage in an artery and inserted two stents. The campaign has canceled its events until further notice so Sanders can recover, and it postponed its first major Iowa television ad buy that was set to start on Thursday.
"Bernie is up and about. Yesterday, he spent much of the day talking with staff about policies, cracking jokes with the nurses and doctors, and speaking with his family on the phone. His doctors are pleased with his progress, and there has been no need for any additional procedures," Jane Sanders, the senator's wife, said in a statement. "We expect Bernie will be discharged and on a plane back to Burlington before the end of the weekend. He'll take a few days to rest, but he's ready to get back out there and is looking forward to the October debate.”

The television ad buy is still postponed, according to CNN. Sanders supporters will continue to campaign for him as the Vermont senator recovers.
Patients who undergo the common procedure that Sanders endured normally return to their regular routines within weeks.
"I have no idea what happened and the particulars of his case, but in and of itself I don't think it means anything for his ability to exercises and function," said Dr. Fred Welt, chairman of the American College of Cardiology's Interventional Committee.
The Democratic debate, hosted by CNN and the New York Times in Ohio, will feature 12 candidates on one debate stage — the largest number of candidates ever on a presidential primary debate stage.
Sanders is the oldest Democratic presidential candidate in the 2020 field, and if elected he would be the oldest president to ever serve in office. President Ronald Reagan, the oldest president ever, was 77 when he left office in 1989.

Texto completo: Investigative journalist Bob Woodward was booed while asking questions during a D. C. event for New York Times reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, according to verified news reporters on Twitter who were at the event.
The event was focused on Twohey and Kantor's book, "She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," which was released in September.
The book is an investigative look into the sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein first reported by Twohey and Kantor in the New York Times.
In a blistering report published on Oct. 5, 2017, the Times detailed nearly 30 years of reports by women accusing the Oscar-winning movie producer of sexual harassment.
Gwyneth Paltrow was 'determined' to help bring down Weinstein, according to new book
Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he's a 'sinner,' not a rapist
Several people took to Twitter to slam Woodward for his questions during the event, which took place at Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington, D. C. Those at the event also said Woodward interrupted Twohey and Kantor repeatedly.
"Listening to (Kantor) and (Twohey) discuss their remarkable reporting, and Bob Woodward keeps cutting them off," Kira Lerner, a reporter for The Appeal, said on Twitter. "He's also repeatedly asking them why Weinstein did this, and the audience is protesting/yelling back/walking out. "
Jodi Kantor: This book is an x-ray into power. Bob Woodward: But it’s also about sex?Audience (loudly): No
— Kira Lerner (@kira_lerner) October 2, 2019
Kara Swisher added, "Ouch (Woodward) is really blowing this interview with (Twohey) and (Kantor) on their book 'She Said. ' Interruptive, not focused on the women who were victimized by Harvey Weinstein and weirdly obsessed with that creep, it’s a exercise in how not to interview. The crowd no like. "

The crowd no like. pic. twitter. com/sEvEZPOlmG
— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) October 3, 2019
In a long thread detailing the night, Works in Progress founder Robyn Swirling said Woodward's questions were "aggressive and uninformed. "
Audience members were "over" Woodward, CNN political commentator Hilary Rosen said on Twitter.
It concerns me that @realBobWoodward is so clueless to the reaction of his push for @mega2e and @jodikantor to speculate on #HarveyWeinsteins desire for “sex”. He isn’t hearing them say this is about power, not sex. The audience is over him.
— Hilary Rosen (@hilaryr) October 2, 2019
"We're just starting our book tour, and we're grateful to all the moderators – Bob Woodward, Katie Couric, America Ferrera and many others – who have agreed to join us onstage," Twohey and Kantor told USA TODAY in a statement. "We welcome all questions, from them and especially from the audience, because each one is an opportunity to relate the wrenching decisions that many of our sources had to make and grapple with #MeToo as an example and test of social change in our time. "
USA TODAY has reached out to Woodward's representatives and The Washington Post, where Woodward is an associate editor.

Texto completo: Worst plane crashes in Connecticut history
The crash of a World War II-era B-17 at Bradley International Airport Wednesday was among the worst plane crashes in Connecticut history. Here are some of the others.
Allegheny Airlines Flight 485
Thirty people - 28 passengers and two crew members - were killed when a plane attempting to land at Tweed New Haven Airport on June 7, 1971 collided with three vacant beach cottages and crashed into a swampy field. A report from the National Transportation Safety Board said the crash was the result of pilot error, specifically that the pilot had descended the aircraft below the minimum altitude for landing under adverse weather conditions. An investigation determined most of the passengers died trying to escape the plane's burning wreckage. Only two passengers and one crew member aboard the flight survived.
Pilgrim Airlines Flight 203
All five people aboard the flight died on Feb. 10, 1970 when it crashed in Long Island Sound near Waterford two hours after taking off from Groton-New London Airport. The plane's original destination was John F. Kennedy International Airport, but it was held in the New York area due to deteriorating weather conditions, diverted to Tweed-New Haven Airport, where it attempted and missed a landing, and then ran out of fuel and went down in the Sound attempting to return to Groton-New London, coming up about five miles short. The NTSB determined the result of the crash was "fuel exhaustion resulting from inadequate flight preparation and erroneous in-flight decisions by the pilot-in-command."
Action Air Charters Piper PA-31-350 Chieftain
Seven people on a charter flight coming home from Atlantic City, N.J., died on April 27, 1994 when the plane carrying them slammed into a fence at Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford. An eighth victim died the next morning of smoke inhalation at the hospital. The NTSB ruled the crash, on a foggy night, was largely the pilot's fault but also blamed the airport's flawed design. Officials "recommended moving a two-lane state highway away from the airport to allow room for a safety zone beyond one runway, to protect planes that overrun it, and installing new landing lights for the runway," according to an account in the New York Times. The NTSB concluded the pilot should have made a second landing approach given the fog and a strong tail wind.
Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B
Four people were killed - including two children on the ground - when a plane slammed into an East Haven home on Aug. 11, 2013 as it approached Tweed New Haven Airport. The NTSB blamed the crash on pilot error, specifically the pilot's "failure to maintain airspeed while banking aggressively in and out of clouds for landing in gust tailwind conditions." That caused the plane to stall and begin an uncontrolled descent, the report said. The pilot and his son died when the plane crashed upside down into a pair of homes. The father and son had been traveling to Tweed from Teterboro Airport.
Collings Foundation Boeing B-17G
The vintage aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff Wednesday morning as it attempted to return to Bradley International Airport after reports of engine trouble, leaving at least seven dead and seven more injured. The plane crashed into an airport building as it was trying to make an emergency landing and burst into flames. It was owned by the Collings Foundation, a Massachusetts nonprofit that restores World War II-era aircraft. The planes travel the country and are open for people to tour or take a ride on. NTSB investigators arrived at the airport in the afternoon but said it was far too soon to determine what caused the plane to crash.

Trump likely to rank last among presidents, makes Nixon look good

Texto completo: Let’s say we had a president who did the following: Redistributed wealth by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. Boosted entitlements. Signed a law to strengthen workplace safety. Poured money into cleaning up the environment. Even helped finance National Public Radio. Liberals would be pleased, right?
We did have such a president. His name was Richard Nixon.
Of course, all this is largely forgotten today, overshadowed by Nixon’s involvement in Watergate — the scandal that drove him from office in 1974, as impeachment and possibly even Senate conviction were nipping at his heels.
Because of this mixed legacy, Nixon ranks as the 28th best president (or the 16th worst, depending on how you look at it) in a 2017 C-SPAN survey of historians. In 10 categories, he scores near the middle for most, though 10th for “International Relations. ” But in terms of “Moral Authority” he’s near the bottom, ranked 42nd. Lying to the American people and covering up a Constitution-shredding crime will do that to a guy.
How will historians rate Trump?
President Donald Trump will be included in the next survey, which is taken every time we have a new president. Where do you think he'll rank? For starters, let's compare his actions with all the Nixon accomplishments mentioned above. Trump is the anti-Nixon. After lying through his teeth in 2017 about how “the rich will not be gaining at all with this plan," he gave them (and himself) a huge tax break.
Entitlements? He has reportedly told Senate Republicans that cutting Social Security and Medicare could be a second-term project. We got a preview of his plans to do just that in his 2020 budget blueprint in which he proposed cuts. Funny, Trump likes to run his mouth on Twitter and at his rallies, but this is something he hasn’t blabbed to his wide-eyed, believe-whatever-he-says base.
Strengthen workplace safety? “We want to protect our workers,” Trump said in 2017. But that was another lie. His administration has rolled back worker protections, making already dangerous jobs like coal mining, working on oil rigs and in meat processing plants even more so. Overall, "they've done more things to hurt workers than they have to help them. And that's unfortunate," AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said last month on Fox News Sunday.
Trump vs. Nixon is no contest
And cleaning up the environment? Nixon proposed a new Environmental Protection Agency in July 1970, and it began operations five months later. Trump has gutted it, and when he brags about all the regulations he has cut — to the wild applause of his base — what he’s not telling them is that he is endangering the air they breathe and the water they drink. They applaud and then go home, apparently oblivious to the 85 (and counting) rules he has rolled back. Air pollution, water pollution, toxic substances, on and on and on.
There's more, but you get the point: Trump is worse than Nixon. And I haven't even gotten to the scandals. What Trump has done is far more damaging to our country. To me, it can be summed up from just one event: his infamous meeting in the Oval Office in May 2017 with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
It was bad enough that Trump revealed highly classified information that, according to two unnamed officials cited in The New York Times, exposed an intelligence source in the Middle East. But we’ve since learned — based on three sources obtained by The Washington Post — that Trump told his Kremlin guests he didn't care that the Russians had interfered in our 2016 election.
Aid and comfort equals treason
An enemy attacks us and our commander in chief doesn’t care? If this is true then I will use, for the first time, a word that distresses me deeply: treason. This isn’t just my view. Article 3, Section 3 of our beloved Constitution says: “Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. ”
The Russians attacked us. If the commander in chief who swore to defend us said it didn’t bother him, this is “giving them aid and comfort. ” The Russians are surely gearing up for more mayhem in 2020, and what does Trump care? Treason.
Now we learn that Trump has leaned on foreign governments like Ukraine and Australia to dig up dirt that would help him politically. For all his dirty tricks, Richard Nixon would never have dreamed of doing that.
Trump is a man with no ethical compass or shred of decency. Worse than Nixon? Worse in every way. And worse than all the rest.

Texto completo: An explosion in reports of child sexual abuse imagery on the internet is prompting the authorities to step up pressure on technology companies over their use of encryption -- and Facebook, which flags by far the largest amount of the material, is drawing outsize attention.
The tension is part of a growing debate over privacy and policing in the digital age. Law enforcement groups have long lamented the use of encryption, a tool that protects personal data from hackers and government surveillance but also lets child predators and other criminals hide their online activities.
There is increasing "international consensus, at least among law enforcement folks, that this is a serious problem," said Sujit Raman, an associate deputy attorney general in the Justice Department. "And the companies, you know, they're just not as engaged on the issue as they really need to be."
The New York Times reported on Saturday that Facebook Messenger, which is not encrypted, accounted for nearly two-thirds of reports last year of online child sexual abuse imagery. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said that Facebook as a whole was responsible for 90 percent of the reports.

In March, the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, announced that the messaging service would move to encryption in coming years, setting up a direct conflict between its business interests and the demands of law enforcement.
Jay Sullivan, Facebook's director for messaging privacy, said the company was transitioning to encryption because it was one of the fastest areas of online growth, according to prepared remarks at a conference last month at Stanford University. The company's other messaging service, WhatsApp, is already encrypted.
Justice Department officials, including Attorney General William P. Barr, are expected to raise concerns about the change to Messenger, and about encryption overall, at an event on Friday with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the national clearinghouse for child sexual abuse imagery and officials from the Australia and Britain.
"Online child exploitation has increased dramatically in the past few years, and offenders continue to adopt more sophisticated means to entice victims and evade justice," the department said in invitations to the event.
Law enforcement agencies say encryption is a major obstacle in child sex abuse, terrorism and other investigations. The Justice Department has repeatedly sought ways to break encryption, but doing so would create opportunities for hackers and allow for broader surveillance. Those efforts have been strongly opposed by groups focused on internet privacy protections.
"A secure messenger should provide the same amount of privacy as you have in your living room," said Erica Portnoy, a technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. "And the D.O.J. is saying it would be worth putting a camera in every living room to catch a few child predators."
But Mr. Raman, the associate deputy attorney general, said platforms like Facebook provided opportunities for child predators that were not readily available in the real world, creating a need for more scrutiny.
"It's a unique platform," he said. "You have a combination of open profiles, which almost creates a menu of options if you're a child predator, and also will provide -- if they implement their plans -- the sort of mechanisms for drilling down and contacting children" with encryption.
Criminals have become adept at using encryption and the so-called dark web to cloak themselves, requiring greater effort by law enforcement to identify them. Even so, mainstream technology companies, like Apple, have come to embrace encryption technologies, particularly after disclosures about large-scale data collection by the National Security Agency.
"There are really good reasons to have end-to-end encryption, but we have to acknowledge it comes with trade-offs," said Hany Farid, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped develop technology in 2009 for detecting online child abuse imagery.
Gavin Portnoy, a spokesman for the clearinghouse of abuse material, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said officials there opposed the widespread adoption of encryption. "The rape and sexual exploitation of children that we see in millions of reports to the cyber tip line will continue to circulate online, but will be invisible to tech companies," he said.
The Times reported on Saturday that tech companies flagged 45 million photos and videos as child sex abuse material last year. Those images were contained in 18.4 million reports, nearly 12 million of which came from Facebook Messenger. It was unclear whether photos and videos of abuse were actually more prevalent on Facebook or were just being detected at a high rate.
"We're not picking on Facebook," Mr. Raman said. He compared the millions of reports from Messenger with those sent by Apple, which encrypts its iMessage system. Apple sent 43 reports last year and about 150 so far in 2019.
An Apple spokesman said the company worked closely with law enforcement and complied with all legal obligations.
The decision to encrypt Messenger has raised alarms other countries that rely on reports submitted by tech companies to the national clearinghouse. The center distributes the reports to the authorities both domestically and internationally.
Fernando Ruiz Pérez, head of operations for cybercrimes at Europol, said Facebook was responsible for a "very high percentage" of reports to the European Union. He said that if Facebook moved to encrypt messaging, the "possibility to flag child sexual abuse content will disappear."
Technologists at Facebook and elsewhere have been discussing ways to limit the spread of illicit content on a system that uses encryption, but it is proving a thorny problem.
Guy Rosen, Facebook's vice president for integrity, said at the Stanford conference that the company would rely on "signals" that could indicate the spread of abuse imagery even if Facebook was unable to see it -- when users tried to distribute messages to large groups, for example.
But Dr. Farid, the professor who helped build the detection technology, said that would be inadequate. He suggested scanning for abuse content by making a fingerprint of an image before the message was encrypted, and then comparing the fingerprint with a database of known illegal material.
"I don't think there's a technical barrier here," Dr. Farid said. "They're doing this because they want to avoid liability."
Multiple cryptography experts said the practice would significantly weaken the privacy benefits of end-to-end encryption on images, however.
"They're saying it's O.K. to open it up to hackers or Chinese censorship," said Ms. Portnoy, the digital rights technologist. "That system right there is very similar to how Chinese browsers implement censorship."
Alex Stamos, a Stanford professor who arranged the conference, and Facebook's former chief information security officer, acknowledged that all the proposals involved trade-offs. But he said the discussion was necessary because child sexual abuse material was "by far the worst thing that happens online."
"There are options here," Mr. Stamos said. "But you can't quite have your cake and eat it too."

Texto completo: A federal judge ruled Wednesday that a nonprofit group's bid to open a site in Philadelphia where people can inject drugs under medical supervision does not violate federal law, an unprecedented decision that could affect the way cities across the country address the opioid crisis.
U.S. District Judge Gerald A. McHugh wrote that a provision of the Controlled Substances Act aimed at closing crack houses does not apply to the nonprofit organization's bid to aid opioid abusers in Philadelphia's drug-ravaged Kensington section.
"No credible argument can be made that facilities such as safe injection sites were within the contemplation of Congress" when lawmakers adopted the initial drug law in 1986 or when they amended it in 2003, McHugh wrote.
Cities across the United States, including Denver, Seattle, San Francisco and New York, have considered opening such facilities but have been stymied by the federal law and the Justice Department's vow to halt any project of its kind.
Safehouse, a nonprofit organization that has the support of Philadelphia officials and former governor Ed Rendell, who sits on its board, decided to press forward nonetheless. The Justice Department sued in February to halt the project, leading to McHugh's decision Wednesday.
"We're grateful the judge agreed with us that federal law allows Safehouse to open a facility for the purpose of saving lives and preventing overdose deaths," Ronda Goldfein, Safehouse's vice president and executive director of the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania, said in an email. "This is a major step forward that lays the legal groundwork for moving ahead with this critical public health intervention."
Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen said the Justice Department is "disappointed in the court's ruling and will take all available steps to pursue further judicial review."
He said that "any attempt to open illicit drug injection sites in other jurisdictions while this case is pending will continue to be met with immediate action by the department."
Supervised injection sites are widespread in Canada and Europe where, advocates and researchers say, they have saved thousands of lives of people who use opioids and have directed some of them into treatment.
Typically, a site is stocked with naloxone, the antidote to overdoses of illegal fentanyl, and heroin, as well as oxygen, which helps revive overdose victims. Users bring in drugs obtained on the street and are monitored as they inject or smoke the drugs in an effort to prevent overdoses. Some sites also provide clean syringes, matches for cooking heroin, elastic strips to tie off veins, water to dilute drugs and other provisions.
Efforts to open a similar facility in the United States have been blocked by the Justice Department's adamant opposition.
In September 2018, then-Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein wrote in a New York Times opinion column that "because federal law clearly prohibits injection sites, cities and counties should expect the Department of Justice to meet the opening of any injection site with swift and aggressive action."
But McHugh wrote that "I cannot conclude that Safehouse has, as a significant purpose, the objective of facilitating drug use. Safehouse plans to make a place available for the purposes of reducing the harm of drug use, administering medical care, encouraging drug treatment and connecting participants with social services."
The plans also have run into concerns from some residents of cities who fear that the facilities will become magnets for drug users in their neighborhoods.
In Philadelphia, where more than 1,000 people have died of drug overdoses in each of the past two years, Safehouse would open in a neighborhood that has one of the most active open-air heroin markets in the country. In addition to attempting to prevent overdoses, Safehouse would provide sterile equipment, fentanyl test strips, medically assisted drug treatment and other kinds of medical care.
But it is not clear how soon Safehouse might be able to open. "The judge's decision is not a final judgment but lays the groundwork for us to move forward," Goldfein said.

Secure the border, but don't even think about alligators or shooting migrants

Texto completo: Border security is fine. Sheer cruelty to get there is not.
New reporting from the New York Times reveals disturbing details about President Trump's vision for a border wall that are downright inhumane.
Here’s what the Times reports:
Privately, the president had often talked about fortifying a border wall with a water-filled trench, stocked with snakes or alligators, prompting aides to seek a cost estimate. He wanted the wall electrified, with spikes on top that could pierce human flesh. After publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks, the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal. But later in a meeting, aides recalled, he suggested that they shoot migrants in the legs to slow them down. That’s not allowed either, they told him.
It sounds unbelievable, and Trump denies the story, but the Times was thorough in confirming the story. As they say, "This article is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House and administration officials directly involved in the events of that week in March. They were granted anonymity to describe sensitive conversations with the president and top officials in the government."
Think about this for a moment: President Trump, if he had his way, would have us shoot border crossers, many of whom are women and children. Wanting to secure the border is fine, but it's another level to be so paranoid to want a draconian moat, with a trench filled with alligators. That's outlandish and absurd. Tweet
There’s nothing wrong with wanting to secure the border. A sovereign country has the right to protect its citizens and enforce its borders. Despite what some liberal critics suggest, it’s not racist or xenophobic to support a border wall. But immigration policy calls for both prudence and compassion, which Trump clearly lacks on this issue.
Per the Times’ reporting, Trump’s aides have repeatedly had to plead with him to not shut the border down in its entirety. Shutting down the border would be a disaster: It would cause enormous economic disruption and shut down the personal and commercial traffic that relies on traveling across the border every day.
Apparently Trump viewed more level-headed immigration officials such as former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as members of the “deep state,” because anti-immigration activist Ann Coulter and Fox Business pundit Lou Dobbs "hate her."
It’s worth pointing out just how exaggerated the border threat has become. Yes, border security is important — but it’s also true that illegal immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than native-born citizens, and border crossings are already falling without the implementation of such disturbing enforcement methods.
All in all, these revelations paint a disturbing picture of Trump’s approach to immigration. He is right to want to secure the border, but this can be done in a safe, humane, and compassionate way. The president’s fantasies are anything but.

Texto completo: House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff knew the details of the whistleblower's complaint against President Trump before it was filed because the CIA officer went to one of the committee aides beforehand, according to the New York Times.
After a colleague went to the agency's top lawyer and feeling unsatisfied with the status of the response, the whistleblower approached a House Intelligence Committee aide with the basic facts of the upcoming complaint.
The aide told the officer to follow the standard procedure, which includes hiring a lawyer and filing an official whistleblower complaint within the intelligence community. The aide then proceeded to inform Schiff of the conversation but left the whistleblower's identity anonymous.
“Like other whistle-blowers have done before and since under Republican and Democratic-controlled committees, the whistle-blower contacted the committee for guidance on how to report possible wrongdoing within the jurisdiction of the intelligence community,” said Patrick Boland, a spokesman for Schiff.
The complaint was filed in August in regards to Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his subsequent request for the foreign leader to jump-start an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The younger Biden was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, which was investigated for corruption, but he was not accused of any illegal activity.
Schiff has played an active role in the president's ire on the matter of the whistleblower complaint and the subsequent impeachment inquiry. The president has repeatedly called for his resignation after he read a fake copy of the president's conversation with Zelensky during acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire's testimony in front of his committee last week.

Texto completo: El principal demócrata en el Comité de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado envió cartas al secretario de Energía Rick Perry y al vicepresidente Mike Pence cuestionando sus roles en la campaña de presión del presidente Trump sobre el gobierno ucraniano, aparentemente en busca de información para perjudicar en Joe Biden.
El senador Bob Menéndez , D-N.J., el miembro de mayor rango del comité, envió las cartas después de que el denunciante cuya queja desencadenó la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara citó las acciones de Pence y Perry como parte de un esfuerzo más amplio para “presionar al liderazgo ucraniano”.
El denunciante escribió que Trump “instruyó” a Pence a cancelar un viaje planeado a Ucrania para asistir a la inauguración del nuevo presidente Volodymyr Zelensky en mayo.
En su lugar, Rick Perry “lideró la delegación” y “dejó en claro” a los funcionarios ucranianos que Trump “no quería reunirse” con Zelensky hasta que “viera cómo Zelensky” eligió actuar “en el cargo”.
Menéndez citó el informe del denunciante y las reuniones de Perry con Zelensky, el primer ministro de Ucrania, y el jefe del parlamento en su carta a Perry.
“La llamada telefónica del presidente Trump y las denuncias en la denuncia de denunciantes plantean serias dudas sobre los mensajes que se comunicaron en nombre del presidente Trump al gobierno de Ucrania”, escribió Menéndez.
Menéndez incluyó una lista de preguntas en busca de información sobre quién solicitó a Perry que encabezara la delegación ucraniana, así como si los asesores de Trump o de la Casa Blanca le pidieron que transmitiera el “deseo de ayuda de Trump para investigar a uno de sus opositores políticos”.
El papel de Perry también figura en la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara . Los demócratas de la Cámara emitieron el lunes una citación en busca de cualquier comunicación que el Departamento de Energía pudiera haber tenido sobre las conversaciones de Trump con Zelensky, informó Politico.
Perry, uno de los pocos miembros del gabinete de Trump que ha evitado serios escándalos hasta ahora, ha visitado Ucrania varias veces como secretario de energía y ayudó a elaborar un acuerdo que incrementó las exportaciones de carbón de Estados Unidos al país.
Perry tuiteó una foto de su reunión más reciente con Zelensky el mes pasado.

Zelenskyy is committed to reforming Ukraine & ensuring Ukrainians are no longer hostage to Russia. For Ukraine, energy security is national security. pic.twitter.com/5NWPFSFMMB
— Rick Perry (@SecretaryPerry) September 1, 2019
Menéndez también envió una carta similar a Pence.
Pence defendió el movimiento de Trump para bloquear la ayuda militar a Ucrania días antes de la llamada a Zelensky, alegando que se mantuvo en revisión debido a “problemas de corrupción”, informó el New York Times.
Después de reunirse con Zelensky en Polonia en un viaje que Trump se saltó, Pence dijo a los periodistas que para invertir más dinero de Estados Unidos en Ucrania, “el presidente quiere estar seguro de que esos recursos realmente están llegando al tipo de inversiones que contribuirán a la seguridad y la seguridad”. estabilidad en Ucrania “.
Menéndez preguntó si Pence estaba realmente en Polonia para presionar a Zelensky para que investigara a Biden.
A lo largo de la presidencia de Trump, Pence ha sido un segundo leal, alabándolo y defendiéndolo. Pero el vicepresidente rara vez se ha visto envuelto en una controversia directa que involucre al presidente hasta ahora.

Texto completo: El principal demócrata en el Comité de Relaciones Exteriores del Senado envió cartas al secretario de Energía Rick Perry y al vicepresidente Mike Pence cuestionando sus roles en la campaña de presión del presidente Trump sobre el gobierno ucraniano, aparentemente en busca de información para perjudicar en Joe Biden.
El senador Bob Menéndez , D-N.J., el miembro de mayor rango del comité, envió las cartas después de que el denunciante cuya queja desencadenó la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara citó las acciones de Pence y Perry como parte de un esfuerzo más amplio para “presionar al liderazgo ucraniano”.
El denunciante escribió que Trump “instruyó” a Pence a cancelar un viaje planeado a Ucrania para asistir a la inauguración del nuevo presidente Volodymyr Zelensky en mayo.
En su lugar, Rick Perry “lideró la delegación” y “dejó en claro” a los funcionarios ucranianos que Trump “no quería reunirse” con Zelensky hasta que “viera cómo Zelensky” eligió actuar “en el cargo”.
Menéndez citó el informe del denunciante y las reuniones de Perry con Zelensky, el primer ministro de Ucrania, y el jefe del parlamento en su carta a Perry.
“La llamada telefónica del presidente Trump y las denuncias en la denuncia de denunciantes plantean serias dudas sobre los mensajes que se comunicaron en nombre del presidente Trump al gobierno de Ucrania”, escribió Menéndez.
Menéndez incluyó una lista de preguntas en busca de información sobre quién solicitó a Perry que encabezara la delegación ucraniana, así como si los asesores de Trump o de la Casa Blanca le pidieron que transmitiera el “deseo de ayuda de Trump para investigar a uno de sus opositores políticos”.
El papel de Perry también figura en la investigación de juicio político de la Cámara . Los demócratas de la Cámara emitieron el lunes una citación en busca de cualquier comunicación que el Departamento de Energía pudiera haber tenido sobre las conversaciones de Trump con Zelensky, informó Politico.
Perry, uno de los pocos miembros del gabinete de Trump que ha evitado serios escándalos hasta ahora, ha visitado Ucrania varias veces como secretario de energía y ayudó a elaborar un acuerdo que incrementó las exportaciones de carbón de Estados Unidos al país.
Perry tuiteó una foto de su reunión más reciente con Zelensky el mes pasado.

Menéndez también envió una carta similar a Pence.
Pence defendió el movimiento de Trump para bloquear la ayuda militar a Ucrania días antes de la llamada a Zelensky, alegando que se mantuvo en revisión debido a “problemas de corrupción”, informó el New York Times.
Después de reunirse con Zelensky en Polonia en un viaje que Trump se saltó, Pence dijo a los periodistas que para invertir más dinero de Estados Unidos en Ucrania, “el presidente quiere estar seguro de que esos recursos realmente están llegando al tipo de inversiones que contribuirán a la seguridad y la seguridad”. estabilidad en Ucrania “.
Menéndez preguntó si Pence estaba realmente en Polonia para presionar a Zelensky para que investigara a Biden.
A lo largo de la presidencia de Trump, Pence ha sido un segundo leal, alabándolo y defendiéndolo. Pero el vicepresidente rara vez se ha visto envuelto en una controversia directa que involucre al presidente hasta ahora.

Last exit from Trumpland

Texto completo: Ask an intelligent Republican staffer what they imagine awaits their party after Donald Trump, and you'll get an interesting disquisition on the factions and figures that might shape conservatism, the political and policy arguments to come.
Ask that same staffer what happens if Trump is reelected, and you'll get a heavy sigh, a thousand-yard stare and then a hopeful "Well, maybe we can just pretend he isn't there ...?"
This is the state of Republican politics with impeachment suddenly looming. People are ready for the after, the reckoning to come, the attempted restorations and Trumpisms-without-Trump, the great Nikki Haley-Tucker Carlson brawl.
But if Trump survives impeachment and somehow gets reelected, there will be no after Trump, not yet and not for four long years. Instead Trump will bestride his party like a decaying colossus, and his administration's accelerative deterioration will be the GOP's as well. There will be no second-term policymaking, no John Kelly to stabilize the ship - just a floating hulk drifting between the icebergs of recession and foreign crisis, with all American conservatism onboard.
Outside the ranks of the truest Trump believers, most Republicans anticipate very bad things in 2022 and 2024 if the Trump Show continues uninterrupted. And most would happily fast-forward through that show if the magical remote control from that terrible Adam Sandler movie were suddenly available.
My days of writing high-dudgeon columns demanding that Republicans act in concert against Trump are behind me; cynicism and bemusement define my attitude toward GOP decadence these days.
But in a bored-Roman-aristocrat drawl, I just want to suggest - mildly, dabbling my hands in a convenient finger bowl - that the current impeachment inquiry might, in fact, be that magical remote control: a chance to hit fast-forward and summon the post-Trump future into existence here and now, for the 2020 campaign.
Hitting the button requires only two things: the swift, before-primary-season impeachment schedule House Democrats are entertaining and then 20 Republican votes in the Senate for conviction, if the Trump-Giuliani operation in Ukraine looks as bad in a few months as it does today.
Of course the second thing is a political near-impossibility. But we're fantasizing here, my dear Petronius, so we can imagine how it might happen. Start with Mitt Romney, add the four retiring Republican senators, plus the most embattled purple-state 2020 incumbents, plus a clutch of Republicans most at risk in 2022, plus the handful of the senators who don't face the voters till 2024 ... and then you're just a few Republicans of principle away from 20.
In voting to remove Trump (and to bar him, as an impeachment can, from simply running for president again immediately), these 20 would allow the other 33 Republican senators to stand by him, thank him for his service and promise to Make America Great Again themselves. And the more ambitious among the latter group of senators would then compete to succeed Trump, while his wrath was concentrated against the treacherous 20.
That competition would be the next phase of our fast-forward: With Trump gone, everyone from Haley and Carlson to Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley could jump into an accelerated primary campaign against the unloved Republican "incumbent," Mike Pence. The result would be, in effect, the 2024 Republican primary four years early - with the possibility of either pre-empting a President Elizabeth Warren or preventing a Trump second term's likely demolition of the party.
Of course this is just a pleasant conceit, whose mere description by a Trump critic like myself will irritate the many conservatives for whom it's absurd to imagine any upside to allowing Democrats and the media to eject a fighting conservative president from office.
I think these conservatives underestimate, as liberals did with Bill Clinton long ago, the advantages in jettisoning a corrupt leader. (An Al Gore presidency was a better timeline for Democrats, even though it would have required the horror of letting Ken Starr win.) But I certainly can see ways in which, after so much elite failure and populist anger, having elites (indeed, the CIA!) work to remove a populist president just before his reelection campaign could make our toxic politics that much worse.
But I would still ask - swirling my wine and adjusting my NeverTrumper toga - worse than what? Worse than a world where Trump survives impeachment, the Ukraine miasma chokes Biden's campaign, Warren proves less electable than her supporters hope, we replay 2016 with the Electoral College and enter a second Trump term with the ship of state rudderless, Democrats yet more radicalized, and all those icebergs looming for the country and the GOP alike?
In the event we do arrive in that world, consider this column a casually tossed marker for the Republican senators who will probably vote to keep Trump in office, in case they find themselves very unhappy with the ultimate result.
You can't say that you didn't have an early exit from the Trump era. You can't say you didn't have a choice.

Not Bad for You, Perhaps, But It's Still a Big Problem

Texto completo: An extensive study confirms that red meat might not be that bad for you. But it is bad for the planet, with chicken and pork less harmful than beef.
The potentially unhealthful effects of eating red meat are so small that they may be of little clinical significance for many people.
This finding, just released in multiple articles in the Annals of Internal Medicine, is sure to be controversial. It should certainly not be interpreted as license to eat as much meat as you like. But the scope of the work is expansive, and it confirms prior work that the evidence against meat isn't nearly as solid as many seem to believe. (While I had no role in the new research, I co-wrote a commentary about it in the journal.)
Red meat has been vilified more than almost any other food, yet studies have shown that while moderation is important, meat can certainly be part of a healthy diet.
This doesn't mean that there aren't other reasons to eat less meat. Some point out that the ways in which cattle are raised and consumed are unethical. Others argue that eating red meat is terrible for the environment.
Recently, meat substitutes have emerged as a possible solution, but the promise is much greater than the reality, at least so far.
Burger King and other fast-food chains are trying out Impossible Foods burgers as a vegan answer to beef. Let's dispense with the idea that this is "healthier" in any way. The Impossible Whopper has 630 calories (versus a traditional Whopper's 660). It also contains similar amounts of saturated fat and protein, and more sodium and carbohydrates. No one should think they're improving their health by making the switch.
What about the environmental argument? Almost 30 percent of the world's ice-free land is used to raise livestock. We grow a lot of crops to feed animals, and we cut down a lot of forests to do that. But beef, far more than pork or chicken, contributes to environmental harm, in part because it requires much more land. The greenhouse gas production per serving of chicken or pork is about 20 percent that of a serving of beef.
Cows also put out an enormous amount of methane, causing almost 10 percent of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to climate change.
There has been a lot of hope that Beyond Meat's pea protein or Impossible Burger's soy could serve as beef burger substitutes, reducing the need for cows. That's unlikely to happen, according to Sarah Taber, a crop scientist and food system specialist. Ground beef is not the problem; steak is.
"There's no profit to be made in ground beef," she said. "That all comes either from leftover parts once cattle have been slaughtered for more expensive cuts, or from dairy cattle that have outlived their usefulness. If everyone gave up hamburgers tomorrow, the same number of cows would still be raised and need to be fed."
In other words, to improve the environment by reducing the number of cows slaughtered, we'd need to find a way to replace the many other cuts of beef Americans enjoy. No lab, and no company, is close to that.
To greatly reduce the reliance on cows, we'd also need to wean ourselves from our high level of milk consumption. The increasing use of alternative milks, like oats or soy, could help, but the dairy industry still dominates.
(The dairy industry's claims about the health of its product are somewhat overblown. Milk isn't nearly as "necessary for health" as many believe.)
Some companies are researching ways to replace the more complex cuts of meat that drive the market. These companies aren't replacing beef with substitutes; they're trying to grow it in the lab using stem cells.
Tamar Haspel, who writes on food policy for The Washington Post, has said such advances are not likely soon. Nor is it clear that they would have an overall positive impact, unless we are sure that this meat can be made in a more energy-efficient way than we can raise cattle.
If meat substitutes won't help in the short run, other things still might. Some believe that raising cattle on pastures, from birth until slaughter, might sequester carbon in the soil better than having cows finish their growth on feed lots. Researchers at the University of Florida argue that it can also be profitable for farmers in warmer climates to do just that. It would require the cattle industry to make significant changes, as well as to relocate, and it seems unlikely they'd be willing to do that.
"Grass-feeding cattle without grain is the norm in New Zealand, but almost no one in the United States does it," Dr. Taber said.
It's also worth pointing out that it would probably take longer to raise cows this way, giving them more time to emit methane.
Other new developments could help with that problem. Some have proposed farming insects to make animal feed. And feeding seaweed to cows, even in small amounts, can significantly reduce their methane burps.
One problem with seaweed is that the component that helps reduce methane emissions is classified as a carcinogen by the Environmental Protection Agency. It's present in small amounts in seaweed, though, and humans have been eating seaweed safely for a long time. A larger problem is that we are unprepared to farm the unbelievable amount of seaweed it would take to feed all the cattle the world is raising.
"Picture a seaweed farm the size of Manhattan," Dr. Taber said.
Until people are truly ready to reduce consumption of dairy or consumption of higher-end beef cuts, or to commit to raising cattle differently, it seems unlikely that any of the changes with respect to ground beef will make a significant environmental difference in the near future.
That doesn't mean there's nothing we can do. I asked Dr. Taber what we might advise people, right now, to help the environment.
"Who needs steak when there's bacon and fried chicken?" she said.

Texto completo: The Boston Red Sox's 2019 season may be over, but there is plenty of baseball to talk about.
To help celebrate the anniversary of Boston's 2004 World Series championship -- which ended the organization's 86-year title drought -- Curt Schilling is coming to Bangor.
Jeff Solari of Rock Lobster Media and the Sports Chowdah newsletter are putting on the "Cookout with Curt Schilling" on Saturday. The event begins at 4:30 p.m. at the Anah Shrine Temple on outer Broadway in Bangor.
The cookout was originally scheduled for July, but a water leak causing flooding at the facility and it was postponed.
The event will feature an all-you-can-eat cookout, meet-and-greet, photos and autograph session between 4:30 and 6 p.m., followed by a Schilling story-telling session and a question-and-answer period from 6 p.m. to 7:15 p.m. involving Solari and Sterling Pingree from the Sports Chowdah and WABI-TV Channel 5 sports director Eric Gullickson.
Schilling has been an outspoken and controversial figure, both during and after his big-league career. He worked as a baseball analyst for ESPN for six years, but according to The New York Times was fired in 2016 after making social media commentary related to North Carolina's law requiring transgender people to use public restrooms and locker rooms associated with their birth gender.
Saturday marks 15 years to the day since Schilling pitched the Red Sox to an American League Championship Series victory over the Angels. He also was the winner in Game 6 of the World Series, when he pitched with a torn tendon sheath in his ankle, resulting in the famous "bloody sock."
Schilling went 21-6 with a 3.26 earned run average during the regular season in 2004 and finished second in the American League Cy Young Award voting. He also pitched in 24 games during the 2007 championship season before retiring.
Schilling had a 216-146 career record in 20 seasons with a 3.46 ERA and 3,116 strikeouts in 3,261 innings. He had three 20-win seasons, two with Arizona.
Schilling was a six-time all-star and won a World Series with Arizona.
He also owned a now-defunct video game company, 38 Studios, which was lured from Massachusetts to Rhode Island only to go bankrupt in 2012. According to Variety, the state of Rhode Island sued the company and other backers and eventually received approximately $61 million in settlements.
Tickets for Saturday's Schilling event can be purchased on the Sports Chowdah website for as little as $29.

Texto completo: It was never part of Michael Pollan's life plan to write a book about psychedelics — nor to use them — but he ended up doing both with profound results, the author told a standing-room-only crowd in a vast tent in the Seaport District Tuesday evening.
Pollan has been best known as the author of several books about food and agriculture, and is famous for the seven-word dietary dictum “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants."
But when the author read about research showing that psychedelics freed terminal cancer patients from the fear of death, he was deeply intrigued, drawn into the research that would result in the 2018 book “How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence."
Answering questions from Bina Venkataraman, who will become The Boston Globe's editorial page editor next month, Pollan described his extraordinary journey on the first day of HubWeek, a three-day festival of musical performances, digital art experiences, speakers, and other activities.
Psychedelics like LSD and “magic mushrooms" were once taken seriously by psychiatrists, Pollan explained. Only after Timothy Leary was thrown out of Harvard amid sloppy science and LSD-taking by his students did psychedelic drugs come to be seen as features of the 1960s counterculture.
Now, researchers at New York University, Johns Hopkins University, and elsewhere are taking another look, and finding intriguing possibilities. Most are studying psilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms." Patients with terminal cancer who took psilocybin experienced significant declines in depression and anxiety that lasted even six months after a single psilocybin “trip."
“It's not a pharmaceutical effect," Pollan said. “The experience, more than the drug, is changing your mind. You're acquiring a new perspective. Your sense of self has changed."
Psychedelics are “essentially nontoxic," he said, affecting the brain but not the rest of the body. There is no lethal dose, and no risk of addiction.
But there are risks: “When the drugs are used in an uncontrolled way, a reckless way, people can walk into traffic or fall off buildings. It has happened," said Pollan, who teaches writing at Harvard and at the University of California Berkeley.
During his psychedelic trips, Pollan had a guide to prepare him for the experience, help him through it, and make sense of it afterward. He took several types of psychedelic drugs, including smoking the venom of a poisonous frog.
But the most meaningful experience was when he was on psilocybin.
“I saw myself dissolve," he said. “Something I recognized as me burst into a little cloud of Post-It notes, which is kind of appropriate for a writer." Then he saw himself as paint spread on the floor.
“I had awareness without ego, without self . . . You no longer have boundaries around you. You melt into something larger."
Some people feel they melt into the cosmos or become one with God. In Pollan's case, he became one with a Bach cello suite playing in his headphones.
He understood why the drug comforted dying patients, showing they were not isolated in a mortal body.
How does this happen? Researchers using functional MRIs have found that psilocybin quiets activity in the “default mode network," a group of brain structures that generates the sense of self. The network is like a switchboard operator connecting different parts of the brain in set ways.
Venkataraman asked Pollan whether psychedelics could play a role in political and social awareness today, as they did in the '60s.
“When you think about it that way, it's exactly the drugs for our times," he said. “We have a very egotistical politics. We objectify the other.
Pollan added that he that knew members of the audience “are thinking 'Trump, Trump, why haven't we given the drug to Trump?' I don't think it would work," he said, to laughter. “Things could go wrong and this man has his finger on the button.
“You need to want it, you need to be willing to dissolve your ego," he added. “He would not want to do that."
Venkataraman, who elicited Pollan's comments as they both sat in white armchairs on the stage, teaches in the program on Science, Technology, and Society at MIT and is a fellow at New America. A former journalist for The New York Times and the Globe, she also served as senior adviser for climate change innovation in the Obama White House and directs the Global Policy Initiatives at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.
Her recent book, “The Optimist's Telescope: Thinking Ahead in a Reckless Age," explores how people can make decisions that will benefit individuals and society over time.

Jessye Norman, an inspired and inspiring opera soprano, dies at 74

Texto completo: From her early performances, critics hailed Jessye Norman as a majestic American soprano who brought a sumptuous, shimmering voice to a broad range of roles wherever she performed — from the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to Tanglewood and other venues around the world.
Ms. Norman, one of the most decorated of American singers, was 74 when she died Monday in New York. The cause was septic shock and multiple organ failure following complications of a spinal cord injury she suffered in 2015, according to a statement by her family.
She won five Grammy Awards, four for her recordings and one for lifetime achievement. She also received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor in 1997 and the National Medal of Arts in 2009.
Finding acclaim as a recitalist and on the concert stage from the outset, Ms. Norman began her career in the late 1960s and went on to sing the title role in Verdi's “Aida," Wagner's heroines, characters in Janacek, Poulenc, Bartok, and Strauss operas, and Cassandre in “Les Troyens" by Berlioz, in which she made her Met debut in 1983.
She appeared in more than 80 performances at the Met, whose general manager, Peter Gelb, told The New York Times on Monday that she was “one of the greatest artists to ever sing on our stage."
Ms. Norman first appeared at Tanglewood in 1972, early in her career.
“If Jessye Norman were as famous as she is good, there would have been a mob at Tanglewood for the Friday night Boston Symphony concert," Globe critic Michael Steinberg wrote that August, lamenting the comparatively small audience of 5,000.
To Wagner's opera “Tristan und Isolde," he added, Ms. Norman brought “musical taste of a high order, intensity, and that kind of personal projection which instantly says 'star.' "
She was a month shy of turning 27 that night, and in a Globe interview a quarter-century later Ms. Norman recalled how she came to be in Tanglewood that evening.
Ms. Norman had been a member of the Deutsche Oper in Berlin when conductor Colin Davis chose her for a 1971 recording of Mozart's “Le Nozze di Figaro." Davis, a Boston Symphony guest conductor, “invited me to come along with him to Tanglewood the next summer, and so I did. . . . It was a first for me, because I had never visited Tanglewood before, even as a guest. Immediately I was struck at how very beautiful everything was."
Charmed by a venue where “people may rehearse in their shirt-sleeves, but they are serious about the music," she recalled that “you can perform Wagner, and thousands of people will come and sit on the grass and bring their children and their grandma and their cousins. That is a wonderful thing."
A keen interpreter as well as a magnificent singer, Ms. Norman had a distinctly opulent tone that sounded effortless, never pushed. It was especially suited to Wagner and Strauss.
In a review of a 1992 recital, Edward Rothstein of The New York Times likened her voice to a “grand mansion of sound."
“It defines an extraordinary space," he wrote. “It has enormous dimensions, reaching backward and upward. It opens onto unexpected vistas. It contains sunlit rooms, narrow passageways, cavernous halls. Ms. Norman is the regal mistress of this domain, with a physical presence suited to her vocal expanse."
As an African-American, she credited other great black singers with paving the way for her, naming Marian Anderson, Dorothy Maynor, and Leontyne Price, among others, in a 1983 interview with the Times.
“They have made it possible for me to say, 'I will sing French opera,' " she said “or, 'I will sing German opera,' instead of being told, 'You will sing “Porgy and Bess." ' Look, it's unrealistic to pretend that racial prejudice doesn't exist. It does! It's one thing to have a set of laws, and quite another to change the hearts and minds of men. That takes longer. I do not consider my blackness a problem. I think it looks rather nice."
In her memoir, “Stand Up Straight and Sing!" (2014), she recounted meeting instances of racism. “Racial barriers in our world are not gone, so why can we imagine that racial barriers in classical music and the opera world are gone?" she told the Times in 2014.
Ms. Norman was born into a musical family on Sept. 15, 1945, in Augusta, Ga., where she grew up in a segregated but close-knit world. Her mother, Janie King Norman, was an amateur pianist; her father, Silas Norman Sr., was an insurance broker. Jessye especially enjoyed visiting her maternal grandparents, fascinated by one particular piece of furniture.
“My grandparents were the only people I ever knew who had one — a grand pedal organ, or more accurately, a harmonium — right there in their house," she wrote in her memoir. “It lived over in the corner of the front room, and I remember thinking that it was the most exotic thing I had ever encountered in my entire life. As far as I can recall, we were never stopped from playing it, nor admonished for disturbing the adults."
She began listening to opera on the radio as a child.
“I remember thinking that opera stories were not very different from other stories: a boy meets a girl, they fall in love, they cannot be together for some reason, and most of the time it does not end happily ever after," she wrote. “For me, opera stories were grown-up versions of stories that were familiar to me already."
She earned a bachelor's degree in music from Howard University and studied at the University of Michigan and Peabody Institute. Her career received its first big boost when she won a first-place prize at the Munich International Music Competition in 1968. The next year, she made her debut on an opera stage at the Deutsche Oper Berlin in Wagner's “Tannhäuser," as Elisabeth.
In 1983, she made her Met debut, opening the company's centennial season singing the role of Cassandre in a starry revival of Berlioz's “Les Troyens."
She rose early the next day to appear on NBC's “Today" show. “The only person in my family who couldn't come on Monday was my mother, who is ill and at home in Georgia," she said at the time. “I wanted to give her a look at me."
Her imposing stage presence and large, voluptuous voice made her ideal for certain parts.
When she sang the title character of Richard Strauss' “Ariadne auf Naxos," one of her defining roles, John Rockwell described her in the Times as “one of our most musicianly singers" and added: “She has just the right voice for this role: a smoothly knit-together soprano that reaches up from plummy contralto notes to a powerful fullness on top."
In a sign of her international stature, Ms. Norman was tapped to sing “La Marseillaise" in Paris on the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day — which she did, in dramatic fashion, at the obelisk on the Place de la Concorde before an array of world leaders, wearing a grand tricolor gown designed by Azzedine Alaïa. She also sang at the second inaugurations of Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
She became a major recording artist at the dawn of the compact disc era, leaving a rich catalog of opera, lieder, spirituals, and recitals.
In person she cut an imposing figure, dressing dramatically and speaking with a diva's perfect diction. And even after she left the opera stage she remained a restless, probing artist, collaborating with the dancer, choreographer, and director Bill T. Jones in 1999 on a piece called “How! Do! We! Do!"
In 2003, Ms. Norman and the Rachel Longstreet Foundation created the Jessye Norman School of the Arts, a free after-school arts program in her native Augusta for underserved students.
Among her final projects was “Sissieretta Jones: Call Her By Her Name!" — a tribute to Jones, who in 1893 became the first African-American woman to headline a concert on the main stage of Carnegie Hall, and who had bristled at her stage name, “the Black Patti," which compared her to the white diva Adelina Patti.
In her memoir, Ms. Norman recalled one of her own earliest stabs at singing opera in front of an audience. She was in junior high school when, at a teacher's urging, she performed the aria “My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice" from Saint-Saëns's “Samson and Delilah." She had been singing it in English at church functions and supermarket openings, but for the school performance her teacher had her learn it in its original French.
“I do think that if you can stand up and sing in French in front of an assembly full of middle-schoolers," Ms. Norman wrote, “then you can do just about anything."

A Simple Regimen Can Prevent TB. So Why Aren’t More People On It?

Texto completo: Tuberculosis struck 10 million people worldwide in 2017, killing 1.6 million of them - a toll greater than that of HIV, malaria, measles and Ebola combined. TB is the leading infectious killer around the globe; nearly 1.8 billion people are carrying the bacterium that causes the disease.
The world is sorely in need of new ways to prevent TB, not just treat it. Drugs to stave off the infection do exist, but the monthslong regimens are difficult and people often do not finish the prescribed courses.
That may soon change: A new drug course, lasting just one month, is just as effective as longer regimens at preventing TB, scientists reported earlier this year. The results have left experts hoping for new progress against a disease that has been an intractable enemy for centuries.
“I think it’s a moment of really extraordinary promise,” said Mike Frick, co-lead for TB at Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization.
Among the plagues sweeping developing countries, TB has often taken a back seat to competing and urgent priorities, especially HIV. (The two are linked: HIV patients account for 1 in 5 TB deaths worldwide.)
In August, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new drug to treat the deadliest strain of TB - but it was the first approval for a TB drug in more than 40 years. Diagnostic tests for the infection are not sensitive and mostly rely on sputum, which many sick people struggle to produce.
And prevention? “It’s really downplayed and it’s ignored, and it’s ignored to a degree that is scandalous,” said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
One challenge is identifying those who should receive preventive drugs. The drugs are the clear choice for the most vulnerable groups: people with HIV; people whose immune systems are compromised because they take biologic drugs for Crohn’s disease, arthritis or other diseases; and young children and others who share a home with someone infected.
Protection for these groups should last at least five years, studies suggest.
But 1 in 3 people worldwide harbor the TB bacteria, and just 1 in 10 will go on to develop the disease. Who among them should be treated?
“The biggest issue has been to identify those 10%,” said Dr. Eliud Wandwalo, senior coordinator for TB at the nonprofit Global Fund. “We don’t have any good indicator to show you which of these people who are infected might progress and become sick.”
For many people who are healthy, or who simply feel healthy, the drugs have been a tough sell.
For decades, the standard course has been an antibiotic called isoniazid that kills the bacteria causing TB only when they are replicating. The drug must be taken daily for nine months, in the hope of catching the bacteria as they multiply, and it can cause numbness, nausea and fever. Isoniazid also can cause liver toxicity, so people taking it are advised not to drink alcohol for the entire nine months.
“Traditionally, completion rates have been very poor,” said Alison Grant, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
Doctors sometimes decline to prescribe the antibiotic because of worries about exposing otherwise healthy people to the side effects, or contributing to a rise in drug-resistant bacteria if patients don’t complete the full course.
Both those concerns are unfounded, said Grant. Doctors “just stay away from it, despite the evidence showing otherwise.”
In the past decade, scientists have come up with two shorter courses: a drug called rifampin taken every day for four months; or a combination of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken once weekly for three months.
Still, for some people, remembering to take the pills - and all 11 pills together - once a week can be more challenging than taking them every day, Grant said.
An alternative emerged in March, when Chaisson and his colleagues published a study in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that a regimen of isoniazid and rifapentine, taken daily for one month, is as effective at preventing TB, safer and more likely to be completed than the traditional nine-month course of isoniazid.
The World Health Organization met to review this new regimen in July and is expected to endorse it later this year. The study was conducted only in people infected with HIV, however, and it is likely that the WHO will approve the regimen only for those patients.
Chaisson thinks preventive drugs should be given to a far larger population.
“If we had an intervention for HIV that reduces mortality by 37%, the WHO would have an emergency meeting and it would be recommended for uptake in the entire world,” he said. “But when it’s for TB, people just sort of shrug.”
“It’s just a stolid world of never-changing practices - slow to adopt, slow to change, slow to evolve,” Chaisson added.
Cost is another hurdle. The one- and three-month courses both rely on rifapentine, made by Sanofi. In 2013, after a yearlong advocacy campaign to lower the costs, Sanofi dropped the price of rifapentine in the three-month course from $71 to $32.
The new one-month course requires more rifapentine overall than the three-month regimen, and so is more expensive. Advocates and global health organizations are in intense negotiations with Sanofi to lower the cost to just $15 for the entire one-month treatment course.
At least two companies are said to be developing generic versions, which also may bring down the cost. Without a lower price, donors like the federal government’s President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief are unlikely to support the new course.
Still, experts said they are more optimistic about TB prevention than ever before.
Just a year ago, funding organizations still presented countries with a false choice between prioritizing antiretroviral therapy for HIV and preventive therapy for TB, said Chaisson.
But PEPFAR has begun to prioritize TB prevention. National governments will have to follow in order to turn back TB.
South Africa has shown what political will can accomplish, said Dr. Gavin Churchyard, a TB specialist based in Johannesburg. The country once had an abysmal TB preventive therapy program, with just a few thousand people taking the pills.
But in 2008, after Pakishe Aaron Motsoaledi, then the country’s health minister, made TB prevention a national priority, the numbers began to rise dramatically. By 2011, 350,000 people were enrolled in preventive therapy. Today, South Africa still has the world’s largest TB preventive therapy program, Churchyard said.
Chaisson did a “back-of-the-envelope” calculation, published in 2017 in the Lancet Global Health, suggesting that if such preventive therapy had been rolled out worldwide, several million deaths could have been averted.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The Department of Transportation responded Monday to House Democrats' probe into Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao's alleged conflicts of interest.
In a three-page letter, Assistant Secretary for Government Affairs Adam Sullivan said "the allegation that the Secretary has used her official position to benefit her family's business is simply false," adding that reports of potential ethics violations "demonstrate a lack of understanding" of cultural values "central to East Asian culture and families. "
On Sept. 16, the Oversight Committee had sent a letter to the Department of Transportation requesting information about her alleged use of her official position to benefit her family's shipping company, Foremost Group, and initial failure to divest ownership of stock in Vulcan Materials, a construction company that received substantial funding from the Transportation Department.
The Committee cited reports in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and Politico about Chao's business interests and potential conflicts of interest. Sullivan slammed the accusations as "unfair insinuations about the Secretary's family. "
The probe: House panel investigates Transportation Sec. Elaine Chao for alleged ethics violations
In response to reports about Chao's appearance with her father in Chinese media interviews with the Department of Transportation seal, Sullivan said it was "no surprise" Chao's "immigrant story" was a "focus of human interest" for media outlets and denied any appearance of impropriety.
He also denied any connection between Chao and Foremost Group and called the internal government probe into Chao's holdings in Vulcan Materials "closed. "
"Of course, the Secretary is not involved with the management or the operations of Foremost Group and has no financial stake in the company," he wrote.
House Democrats said the Department had not given a full explanation for Chao's business interests.
"Unfortunately, the Department provided only generic denials and mostly public documents, but it failed to produce the majority of documents the Committee requested relating to these troubling ethics allegations," said Aryele Bradford. The Committee expects Secretary Chao to produce all of the documents in an expeditious manner and looks forward to her full cooperation in this investigation. "
The probe had infuriated House Republicans, who called it a "smear. "
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the top Republican on the Committee, along with Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N. C. , had criticized the Committee's probe as "an attempt to manufacture controversy to smear Secretary Chao and her family" in a Sept. 25 letter.

According to Sullivan, the Department would be responding to the House Oversight Committee's request for information and documents on a "rolling basis. " His letter included additional information about Chao's financial disclosures and correspondence with ethics regulators.

Texto completo: Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg said he will "go to the mat" and fight efforts to break up the social networking giant, according to leaked audio from meetings with employees.
The leaked audio, obtained by tech site The Verge, originated from two meetings Zuckerberg held with Facebook employees in July.
The sessions covered a range of topics, including increased calls by lawmakers to break up Facebook. Zuckerberg said Facebook would legally challenge any efforts to split up the tech giant.
"We care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things, Zuckerberg said. "But look, at the end of the day, if someone’s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight. "
Zuckerberg also said breaking up Facebook, or other tech titans like Google and Amazon, won't solve issues raised by lawmakers, including how they handle the spread of misinformation on their platforms.
"It doesn’t make election interference less likely," Zuckerberg said. "It makes it more likely because now the companies can’t coordinate and work together. "

Zuckerberg speaks out: Facebook CEO says breaking up social network wouldn't help
Zuckerberg has long said Facebook shouldn't be broken up despite calls seeking such a move, including from co-founder Chris Hughes, who wrote in a May op-ed for The New York Times that the power amassed by Zuckerberg is "unprecedented and un-American. "
Two weeks after that op-ed, Zuckerberg said on a call with reporters that a breakup would make tackling issues more challenging.

Trump to Aussie PM: Help monitor Mueller

Texto completo: President Trump urged Australia's top politician on a recent phone call to give Attorney General William Barr a hand in an investigation the president hopes will undermine the conclusions of special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a report Monday.
Trump asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison (inset) to assist in the Justice Department's ongoing review of the Mueller probe, which looked into the president's connections to Russia and Moscow's illegal attempt to get him elected in 2016, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter told The New York Times.
The White House kept transcripts of the call under tight wraps, only allowing a small group of the president's top aides to review them, the sources said.
The revelation comes as House Democrats are ramping up an investigation into whether to impeach Trump over a July 25 phone call, during which he attempted to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into investigating Joe Biden, the Democratic Party's 2020 front-runner. Transcripts of that call were similarly stored on a secret computer server, according to an anonymous whistleblower complaint released last week.
Also Monday, sources revealed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the call with Zelensky. Pompeo had previously said that he opposed the public release of details about the Zelensky call.
A spokesman for Morrison (inset) confirmed that his phone call with Trump took place, but didn't elaborate on what was discussed.
"The Australian government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation," the spokesman said.
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec also declined to discuss details, but said Barr has asked Trump to introduce him and U.S. Attorney John Durham - who leads the Mueller probe review - to "appropriate officials."
"Mr. Durham is gathering information from numerous sources, including a number of foreign countries," Kupec told the Daily News. "At Attorney General Barr's request, the president has contacted other countries to ask them to introduce the Attorney General and Mr. Durham to appropriate officials."
The request could have put Morrison in an awkward spot as Trump was essentially asking the Australian leader to launch an investigation into his own intelligence community.

US wants jail time for man who threatened Globe

Texto completo: Federal prosecutors are recommending 10 months behind bars for the California man who pleaded guilty in May to charges that he threatened to kill employees of The Boston Globe, according to a Monday court filing.
In a government sentencing memorandum, Assistant US Attorney George P. Varghese also recommended that Robert D. Chain pay the Globe more than $16,000 in restitution after the newspaper spent that much on “additional security expenses as a direct result of Chain's threats."
“Chain terrorized the employees of The Globe newspaper," said Varghese in the filing. “As described by the victims, employees feared for their lives just because they were doing their jobs."
Chain, said Varghese, “deserves to be sentenced commensurate with his crimes."
Chain is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday.
In a Sept. 27 court filing, Chain's attorney, William D. Weinreb, recommended the court sentence his client to time served followed by three years' supervised release that would include six months' home confinement.
In a Monday e-mail, Weinreb said, “Mr. Chain deeply regrets his inexcusable actions and looks forward to the chance to apologize to the victims at the sentencing hearing."
In about 14 calls to the Globe's newsroom in August 2018, Chain repeatedly vowed to attack journalists on behalf of President Trump, a Republican who has denounced news organizations as the “enemy of the people."
Chain's threats included: “You are the enemy of the people and we are going to shoot you all." “You are the enemy of the people. We will hunt you down and kill you and your dogs." “We're gonna shoot you [expletive] in the head, you Boston Globe [expletive]. We're gonna shoot every [expletive] one of you."
Chain began calling the Globe on Aug. 10, 2018, and continued until the FBI's SWAT team arrested him Aug. 30, 2018, at his Encino, Calif., home, where they discovered 20 firearms, including a semiautomatic rifle he had purchased in May 2018, records show.
Chain was indicted on seven counts of use of interstate and foreign commerce to transmit a threat to injure another person based on the calls to the Globe's main newsroom telephone line. Court records include partial transcripts of his comments, which often included expletives and lewd language directed at Globe employees.
According to federal prosecutors, Chain also called writers at The New York Times, leaving “vicious and vulgar voicemails for them as well."
Chain, 69, apologized for his actions in an August letter addressed “To those I have harmed." In the letter, Chain said he could not believe he “said those hateful and disgusting things."
“To the young people I harmed, I can only say, I am sorry," Chain said in the letter. “I am sorry. I am sorry."
