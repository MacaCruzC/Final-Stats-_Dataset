Texto completo: The Tallahassee Community College Foundation is bringing the culinary talents of award-winning chef, restaurateur and author Marcus Samuelsson to Tallahassee for its signature culinary experience: Cleaver and Cork in early March.
An Ethiopian Swedish chef and restaurateur, Marcus Samuelsson is the man behind many restaurants worldwide including Red Rooster Harlem, MARCUS Montreal, and Marcus B&P in Newark, NJ. Samuelsson was the youngest person to ever receive a three-star review from The New York Times and has won multiple James Beard Foundation Awards including Best Chef: New York City. He was also crowned champion of television shows "Top Chef Masters" and "Chopped All Stars" and was the winning mentor on ABC's "The Taste."
While their signature event, A Chef's Table, is sold out, there is still an opportunity for the community to see Samuelsson in action. On Thursday, March 5, TCC will open its doors for A Session with Chef, a live cooking demonstration where Samuelsson will share tips and tricks of the trade, as well as recipes from his cookbooks including New American Table, The Soul of a New Cuisine, Marcus Off Duty and The Red Rooster Cookbook.
I hope to inspire others through Cleaver and Cork to be adventurous, learn something new, and get cooking," said Chef Marcus Samuelsson.
All proceeds from the event will benefit the college's Empower Exploration Campaign, a $4 million comprehensive campaign to support the arts programs at TCC. Funding will provide financial support to Theatre TCC!, Art Programs Endowment, Artist in Residence Endowment, Black Box Theater, as well as art on campus and theater lobby renovations.
Tickets start at $55 and are available at www.cleaverandcorktcc.com. Follow Chef Marcus Samuelsson on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter at @MarcusCooks.

Texto completo: It was recently revealed that Jeff Bezos' iPhone was reportedly hacked, but how?
The tech tycoon received a seemingly innocent message believed to have originated from Saudi Arabia, said U. N experts and published reports. A video file contained sophisticated malware that gave attackers access to files on Bezos' smartphone. The country disputes the claims.
While it's no surprise why bad actors would want to target or exploit the richest man in the world, it's not as if the same type of hack can't happen to you.
In fact, apps like WhatsApp and various operating systems are rife with vulnerabilities that allow hackers to inject spyware, intercept messages, alter attachments and crash the app for all members of a group chat, cybersecurity researchers have discovered over the past year.
In the Amazon CEO's case, the exact type of malware used during the 2018 hack remains shrouded in mystery. However, it's clear that attackers were able to access his entire phone including photos and private communications, the New York Times notes.
Within hours of receiving an encrypted video file, there was a spike in data exiting Bezos' phone, according to U. N. experts.
"The amount of data being transmitted out of Bezos’ phone changed dramatically after receiving the WhatsApp video file and never returned to baseline," U. N. experts said Wednesday in a report published by Vice's Motherboard.

Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, was later at the center of a scandal involving the National Enquirer, which threatened to release his private photos revealing a relationship with another woman while still married. His relationship with Saudi Arabia took a turn south after a journalist who reported for the Washington Post was murdered after criticizing Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Still, you don't have to be a high powered public figure to be hacked, as a 2019 WhatsApp breach demonstrated.
Facebook's messaging app issued a security advisory admitting a cyber threat targeted a "select number" of users. A loophole in WhatsApp's code was patched and Facebook urged users to update the app, which is used by over 1. 5 billion people.
Researchers at the security firm Symantec found another WhatsApp flaw last year that left users open to "Media File Jacking. " When abused, hackers could intercept and alter your photos, videos and sensitive documents before the receiver sees the incoming message.
In December, researchers at Check Point identified a vulnerability that would let hackers crash group chats of ordinary people.
Messaging apps are a top pick for hackers because they can be installed on many types of devices including tablets, smartwatches, laptops and PC, giving cybercriminals access to loads of user data that can be bought, resold and exploited.
"Messaging apps are our main communication interface today," said Oded Vanunu, a leading vulnerability researcher at Check Point. Over the past two years, "there’s been a big race from bad actors to find vulnerabilities on these applications so they can sell it on the internet. "
WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger bugs sell for up to a million dollars, Vanunu said. Online businesses that buy the vulnerabilities from hackers hope to sell knowledge of bugs to governments and corporations.
"We are all targets. You don't have to be famous," said Adam Levin, a cybersecurity expert who launched an identity protection agency. "For hackers, you could be a tributary to a larger river. They’re looking at you as a way to get to somebody you work for, someone in your family or some organization in your network. "

Hacks take many forms, but there some things you can do to thwart smartphone hacking attempts.
How to keep hackers out your smartphone
Be sure to only install official updates. Last July, millions of Android phones were reportedly infected with malware through a fake Samsung app.
Use secure passwords. Ring security cameras were recently hacked and short, easy-to-guess passwords may have been to blame. Two-factor authentication is also a good idea.
Run anti-virus software on your smartphone. These apps protect your device from viruses and other malware, and premium services lock down your privacy settings and scan apps and files for security threats.
Exercise caution. Don't open sketchy links sent to you via text or email. Don't answer suspicious phone calls.

Rojas to replace Beltran as Mets manager

Texto completo: In brief
MLB: The New York Mets are finalizing a multiyear agreement with quality control coach Luis Rojas to make him the team's manager, staying in-house to replace the ousted Carlos Beltran, general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said Wednesday.
Rojas would take over for Beltran, who left the Mets last week before managing a single game as part of the fallout from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.
The 38-year-old Rojas is the son of former Montreal Expos and San Francisco Giants manager Felipe Alou and the half-brother of ex-big leaguer Moises Alou. The former minor league manager has been with the organization since 2007 but had never coached in the majors before joining Mickey Callaway's staff last season.
Callaway was fired after the season, and Rojas interviewed for the vacancy in November before New York hired Beltran.
Beltran's tenure lasted 21/2 months and ended after baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred singled him out in a report on a cheating scheme used by the Astros during their World Series championship season in 2017. The Mets announced he was out as manager three days later.
Rojas, born in the Dominican Republic, played minor league ball with the Orioles, Marlins and Expos/Nationals from 2000-05 but never got above rookie ball.
Big 12 suspends four players from KU-KSU brawl
College basketball: The Big 12 suspended four players from Kansas and Kansas State a combined 25 games for their roles in a Tuesday night melee that spilled off the court and into a section of disabled seating in Allen Fieldhouse near the end of the third-ranked Jayhawks' win over the Wildcats.
Kansas forward Silvio De Sousa, who already was suspended indefinitely by Jayhawks coach Bill Self, was given a 12-game suspension by the league office. His teammate, David McCormack, was suspended two games while Kansas State forward James Love received an eight-game suspension and Antonio Gordon got a three-game suspension.
Both schools also were reprimanded by the Big 12 for violations of its sportsmanship policy.
Red dust, rain hit weather- plagued Australian Open
Tennis: Some of the so-called true blue courts at the Australian Open were coated in red after a rain front that lashed Melbourne overnight pushed through a dust storm from the northwest and left its mark on the city and the tournament.
Crazy weather has plagued the season-opening major at Melbourne Park and caused more disruptions on Day 4, when two-time major winner Garbine Muguruza had to wait for the roof to be closed on Rod Laver Arena before completing her 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 second-round win over Ajla Tomljanovic.
Smoke from devastating bushfires on Australia's east coast caused air quality in Melbourne last week to be ranked among the worst in the world. Heavy rain on three of the first four days of the tournament has caused more difficulties for players and organizers.
On the plus side, there are three stadiums with retractable roofs, so the show court matches will proceed.
In the other completed singles matches, sixth-seeded Belinda Bencic and Donna Vekic advanced to the third round.
Lynx star Moore opts
to stay on hiatus in '20
WNBA: Minnesota Lynx star Maya Moore will sit out a second straight WNBA season to continue her push for criminal justice reform.
Moore told The New York Times of her choice to stay off the court for 2020. She said in her interview with the newspaper that she's not ready to retire. Moore's agent confirmed her decision to The Associated Press.
The 30-year-old, who won the WNBA Most Valuable Player award in 2014 and was a five-time first team All-WNBA selection, also cited fatigue when she first surprised the basketball world last winter by announcing she would step away.
Moore has spent most of the past year trying to help a family friend overturn a conviction.

Trump defenders make it up as they go

Texto completo: The hour of 1 p.m., the designated time for the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, came and went. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was in the Capitol, cooling his heels. But the Senate remained in recess.
Half an hour later, we found out why: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his Senate Republicans had been rewriting the trial rules on the fly, minutes before bringing them to the floor for a vote. They are quite literally making things up as they go along.
Public pressure on moderate Republican senators had, for the moment, forced McConnell to soften a couple of the most egregious trial rules - notably, a plan that would have forced the case to be argued in the middle of the night - but it did nothing to slow McConnell's pell-mell rush to acquit. McConnell, who during a break in proceedings Tuesday huddled with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, succeeded in rebuffing, along party lines, efforts to call witnesses and demand documents that Trump withheld.
Why such a hurry? The answer became apparent as soon as Trump's lawyers opened their mouths for the first time during the impeachment proceedings.
They shouted. They spouted invective. They launched personal attacks against the impeachment managers. But they offered virtually nothing in defense of the president's conduct, nor anything but a passing reference to Ukraine.
"These Articles of Impeachment ... are not only ridiculous, they are dangerous to our republic," declared Cipollone.
"It's ridiculous," he added.
"It's ridiculous! It's ridiculous," he repeated, for those who may have missed the point.
"They're here to steal two elections - it's buried in the small print of their ridiculous articles of impeachment," he alleged.
Cipollone closed with a request to "end this ridiculous charade."
But he didn't rest his case there. He and his colleagues built on this playground-worthy argument: "Outrageous!" "No crime!" "No case!" "False allegations!" "Concocted!" "Hypocrisy!" "They don't have the guts!" "A complete fake!"
Here were the president's men, in the flesh, occupying a factual universe all their own. "The president was not allowed to have a lawyer present" in House proceedings, said the presidential lawyers who refused to be present in House proceedings.
"They ask you to trample on executive privilege," they said, even though Trump hasn't invoked executive privilege.
The impeachment managers have "evidence ... that we haven't been allowed to see," said the White House officials who blocked the release of all documents.
Day One offered the starkest of contrasts: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and his impeachment managers framing their case in somber terms and painstaking detail - and the other side responding with what amounted to an extended reading of Trump's tweets.
Most of the 53 Senate Republicans are lawyers, so they had to be aware that what they were getting from the White House did not amount to a defense. Their body language suggested they wanted the whole thing to end - quickly. Patrick Toomey (Pa.) chewed his reading glasses. Marco Rubio (Fla.) chewed at a fingernail. Ted Cruz (Texas) slouched in his chair. Tim Scott (S.C.) studied the ceiling. Bill Cassidy (La.) sent for a fresh glass of water, though his was not empty. John Hoeven (N.D.) yawned. So did Lindsey Graham (S.C.).
The White House's case is unlikely to improve from here. Also appearing for Trump will be Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz, lately members of Jeffrey Epstein's defense team. Dershowitz has already distanced himself from the brief the White House filed. And the New York Times reported that one of the lawyers cited in Trump's brief has called the White House argument "constitutional nonsense" and "sophistry."
Republicans find themselves defying public opinion in their attempts to avoid testimony. A CNN poll found that 69% of Americans say witnesses should testify in the trial, including 48% of Republicans. Trump himself said in December that he wants White House officials "to testify in the Senate where they'll get a fair trial."
But Trump is now trying so hard to avoid witnesses that the White House is working on backup plans to silence them even if the Senate votes for testimony. Tuesday's arguments made clear why: The White House has no substantive defense.
Rather, it has grievances.
Cipollone returned to the lectern with yet another complaint. The House's case, he declared, "is too much to listen to, almost." But he didn't attempt a refutation.
No wonder McConnell can't be done with this trial fast enough.

Texto completo: A few days before a holiday celebrating his life, conspiracies about Martin Luther King Jr.’s death are circulating on Instagram.
In an image reposted Jan. 14 from another account, a brand called Olmecian Clothing claimed that, contrary to popular belief, King did not die from a gunshot wound. The post includes a photo of what appears to be King in a hospital bed.
“He was killed (smothered) in the hospital,” the post reads. “Also in 1999 the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him but was silenced by the media.”
The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.
We checked Congress’ report on King’s death, as well as the book and lawsuit cited in the Instagram post. None of them provide evidence that the civil rights leader was killed in a government plot — and the photo itself does not show King after he was shot.
King died from gunshot wound
The most authoritative report on King’s assassination is a congressional report from 1979. It said he died from a gunshot wound.
According to the House Select Committee on Assassinations’ report, King was shot shortly after 6 p.m. on April 4, 1968, while standing on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tenn. He was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. at St. Joseph Hospital.
An autopsy conducted at Gaston Hospital determined that King’s cause of death was a “gunshot wound to the chin and neck with a total transaction of the lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord and other structures of the neck.” A convicted armed robber and escaped prison inmate named James Earl Ray pleaded guilty to the first-degree murder of King on March 10, 1969. (He recanted his confession days later but was never able to formally withdraw his guilty plea.)
A decades-old conspiracy theory
The conspiracy that King was killed by someone at the hospital stems from an attorney who represented Ray.
The post’s caption cites a 2016 book by the lawyer, William Pepper, titled “The Plot to Kill King: The Truth Behind the Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.” Moor Information, the Instagram account from which Olmecian Clothing reposted the image, conceded in its caption that the book “has never been verified.”
Pepper represented Ray during the tail-end of his trial for King’s murder and has spent years trying to prove his innocence. Ray died in prison in 1998. Pepper claims in the book that Ray didn’t kill King — instead, he was framed by U.S. government agencies.
There is no direct evidence that happened. Hampton Sides, author of “Hellhound on His Trail: The Stalking of Martin Luther King Jr. and the International Hunt for His Assassin,” told Time magazine in April 2018 that the source of many conspiracies about King’s death can be traced to Ray’s guilty plea, which stopped his trial from proceeding.
Those conspiracies are also fueled by the fact that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spied on King during the 1960s.
Civil suit doesn’t prove conspiracy
As additional evidence for its claim that King was killed in a nefarious government plot, the Instagram post cited a 1999 lawsuit. But the case doesn’t show what the post says it does.
King vs. Jowers was a wrongful death civil suit filed by Pepper on behalf of King’s wife and children. The unlikely partnership was a result of the family’s belief that Pepper’s version of the assassination got at the real truth behind King’s death, according to the New York Times.
Loyd Jowers was a Memphis cafe owner who claimed he hired someone other than Ray to assassinate King. A prosecutor who investigated King’s assassination said several of Jowers’ associates said he hoped to get a movie or book deal.
The jury issued a verdict that said Jowers and “others, including government agencies” were part of a conspiracy to assassinate King. The jury awarded the Kings the $100 in damages that they sought.
But in a 2000 review of the lawsuit, the Justice Department found no evidence to back up the verdict. (It’s worth noting that civil suits only require plaintiffs to prove their case by a “preponderance of the evidence” instead of “beyond a reasonable doubt,” which is a more stringent burden of proof that’s used in criminal court.)
Our ruling
An Instagram post claimed King was smothered to death in a hospital and that “the US government was found guilty in a court of law of conspiring to kill him.”
The Instagram post is inaccurate. We rate it False.

Texto completo: Christine Haughney is, quite simply, one of the nation's most accomplished reporters on the safety and sustainability of the food we eat.
The former New York Times reporter conceived, developed, and produced the web series that became Netflix's “Rotten," about our badly flawed food supply system. One reviewer said the series “manages to use the immediacy of the dinner table as a way to reshape the conversation about what we put in our bodies."
So when Haughney applied to be a Spotlight Investigative Journalism Fellow, the judges took notice. Haughney, along with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Mike Stanton, were named Spotlight Fellows for 2019-20 from a field of nearly 100 other investigative journalists from around the country.
Haughney's resulting investigation about the growing risk of E. coli poisoning from seemingly innocent leafy green vegetables is in keeping with the tradition of The Boston Globe Spotlight Team, whose work was portrayed in the Academy Award-winning film “Spotlight." She exposes a danger that many victims don't even know about until they get sick and reveals the federal government's unreadiness to protect us.
Participant, the producer of “Spotlight," funds the fellowship, which just began accepting applications for its fifth year. Participant CEO David Linde said Spotlight Fellows “are proven defenders of the First Amendment who hold institutions accountable for their actions and behaviors. Their contribution to protecting democracy and everyday Americans is more vital than ever today."

License law criminalizes Maryland's poor

Texto completo: Traffic fines are supposed to be a deterrent. Talk on a cellphone while driving, forget to use a turn signal when changing lanes or go too fast down a residential street and a cop can slap a driver with a fine. That fine is supposed to stop people from wanting to violate the law again.
Except it isn't exactly working that way.
There is a population of low income residents in the state who can't afford the penalties. And they face a worse punishment - they can have their driver's licenses suspended by a judge. Not only do these drivers end up buried in debt, but they lose their licenses, which makes it harder for them to get to jobs they need to pay their debts. Many end up driving on a suspended license, hoping they don't get caught. Drivers who do get caught can be arrested and jailed.
So much for deterring people from breaking the rules.
Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and a bipartisan group of lawmakers want to put an end to suspending driver's licenses for traffic fines, a practice that essentially criminalizes the poor. It's no different from fining the homeless for loitering when they have no place to go or placing high bails on low level crimes committed by people with not enough money.
Legislation pending in both chambers of the Maryland General Assembly would put an end to the practice in Maryland. The bill, which has the support of House Speaker Adrienne Jones and Senate President Bill Ferguson, is something that we support.
People should not end up with arrest records for basic traffic violations. It is well documented that once a person enters the criminal justice system it is hard to get back on their feet.
The state should instead work to keep people out of system. Mr. Frosh has said the bill could impact the lives of 30,000 people.
That's not to say people should be allowed to disobey the rules. We certainly don't want to promote a system of lawlessness. But courts should consider a person's ability to pay certain penalties and fines. The legislation introduced on behalf of Mr. Frosh also allows for payment plans. We would just caution that the installment plans still have to be something that people can afford, or else we are just putting a Band-Aid on the problem.
If Maryland lawmakers pass the legislation, as they should, the state would be one of a few to do the right thing to stop targeting and punishing the poor. In 2017, 43 states, including Maryland, suspended licenses for outstanding court debt, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center. A recent analysis by the Harvard Criminal Justice Policy Program and Human Rights Watch Commission found that cities have become too dependent by such fines as the cost of running their criminal justice systems have grown. Ironically, the system has grown because of mass incarceration and over policing that has resulted in a disproportionate number of poor and black people behind bars.
The Washington D.C. Council unanimously approved legislation to block such suspension of licenses in 2018. The D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles suspended nearly 126,000 licenses between 2010 and 2017 because they failed to pay their traffic tickets, according to The Washington Post. A large majority were African Americans.
Also in 2018, a federal district judge ruled such a law in Tennessee violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution. Judge Aleta Trauger in her opinion said the law failed to consider that some people did not have the money to pay the debts, according to The New York Times. In other words, such fines shouldn't be a one size fits all matter.
Maryland should act before it also ends up in court. Similar legislation introduced last year did not make it out of committee, and that should not be allowed to happen again. Hopefully, the backing of leadership will make it the priority it should be.
Mr. Frosh said during a recent press conference that such matters should be resolved civilly, not criminally. We couldn't agree more. Traffic violations are a matter of public safety not criminal activity. In this case the punishment doesn't fit the offense. That can and should be changed.

That Fenty gent Meet Rihanna's creative 'right hand,' Jahleel Weaver

Texto completo: At 33, Jahleel Weaver has pretty much won the celebrity-stylist lottery.
As deputy creative director of Fenty, the women's ready-to-wear and accessories line introduced by Rihanna in May, his days are spent working alongside a nine-time Grammy Award winner whose clothing brand is backed by LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, and released to her passionate fans without regard to conventional seasonal rhythms.
Theirs is a close relationship. "We talk almost every day," Weaver said. "I feel I'm her little brother," although Rihanna is younger, at 31.
"Creatively, he is my right hand," she wrote of Weaver in an email, "but at the same time, it's as if we're family."
The path that led Weaver to help guide the most talked-about fashion debut of 2019, founded by one of the most influential women in popular culture, was a long and gently winding one.
At 18, he moved from suburban Maryland to New York to study fashion design at LIM College. Weaver helped support himself by working in sales at Jeffrey, the high-end retailer in the meatpacking district known for its extensive shoe department and attentive customer service.
He quickly met some famous clients, many downtowners working in music, and began to style several. "To be working for, and building a brand," Weaver said, "I always think about my experience at Jeffrey."
Weaver was also making inroads working as a freelance stylist away from the store, and it was on one of these gigs that he met Mel Ottenberg, who is currently the creative director of Interview magazine. Ottenberg had just begun collaborating with Rihanna on her 2011 "Loud" tour and brought Weaver on to assist him.
Soon enough, Weaver and Rihanna became inseparable, traveling the globe together. (Ottenberg continues to style Rihanna on occasion, as he did in 2018, dressing her when she was a host of the Met Gala in a dazzling jewel-embroidered, papal-inspired Margiela ensemble.)
When Rihanna decided in 2014 to start the umbrella company Fenty Corp., giving it her last name, she asked Weaver to join as a junior creative director.
He was there to help her create the beauty line Fenty Beauty, which soon had legacy cosmetics brands scurrying to broaden the colors of foundation on offer; Savage x Fenty, a line of inclusive, body-positive-inspired lingerie, the show of which had fashion week attendees squealing in September; and Cameo, her everything-old-is-new-again jewelry line.
"The most valuable thing Jahleel brings to the process," Rihanna said, "is his complete understanding of my vision."
Virgil Abloh, the founder of the cult streetwear-inspired fashion line Off-White and the artistic director for menswear at Louis Vuitton (also part of LVMH), said the creative dynamic between Rihanna and Weaver has resulted in "looks that are cemented within popular culture." (Fuzzy slides were just the beginning.)
Abloh first came to know Weaver through what he refers to as an "international tribe of creatives," a community of designers and artists constantly on the move.
Weaver, although he continues to travel extensively, now lives primarily in Paris. He moved there in early 2018 to begin work on Fenty's debut, a fairly stressful undertaking.
"How do you put everything that Rihanna represents into one collection?" Weaver said.
The answer came to the pair late one night in the form of a music metaphor: an album and its release. Rather than settle on distinct, themed collections shown twice a year, Fenty would drop capsule collections throughout the year, much as singles are released over the course of an album's rollout.
This would heighten anticipation and set the brand apart from the grind of the fashion pack.
"Each release," Weaver said, "can speak to something different," with inspiration taken from various aspects of Rihanna's personal style, be it sleek futurism or the history of Cameo.
"At the end, you have a full album, a full body of work," Weaver said. "I think that's the beauty about our release schedule - there's a piece of Fenty for everything you might need to get dressed."
Basing Fenty's strategy around online drops was a radical move, jolting the old seasonal schedule with the hectic cadence of fast fashion.
But Fenty has been even more cutting edge in giving people of color a place at the top of an industry still plagued by racial inequality and insensitivity.
When Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH announced Fenty, Rihanna became the first woman and person of color to establish a house with the luxury retail giant. At a time when high-profile brands continue to be plagued by racist missteps - just this year Gucci was forced to recall a balaclava knit-top that resembled blackface - the significance of Fenty's debut was not lost on Weaver.
"All the barriers that were broken in that one day, with that one announcement," he said, "I actually cried."
Along with Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Olivier Rousteing running Balmain, Rihanna's entry into the field was further evidence to many that change, however overdue, is finally coming to the upper echelons of luxury fashion.
Weaver is feeling optimistic. "Because of people like Ri constantly breaking barriers," he said, "it makes it a lot easier to exist in space where representation for people of color didn't necessarily exist."
And his own place in that space?
"Honestly," Weaver said, "I think I'm still pinching myself."

Junior-high boys caught up in scrunchie crush craze

Texto completo: Here's the news from winter break: Scrunchies have become a desired item for junior-high schoolboys.
Today's tween girls are offering their scrunchies - the fabric-poofed hair elastics last popular in the 1980s - to their crushes. If accepted, the boy will wear it around his wrist until he finds a new scrunchie - er, crush.
If he really likes the girl, he can offer his hoodie in return.
"Well, now I know why my 13-year-old has a bunch of scrunchies in his room, and why his hoodie is missing," said Amanda Marks, who lives in Decatur, Georgia, and is the co-host and producer of the "Sis & Tell" podcast.
How this trend started is a bit of a mystery, but it appears to have gained traction.
It's possible that the Netflix movie "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" had something to do with it. During the flick, which is based on Jenny Han's young adult book series, the main character snags a scrunchie from his crush's hair and puts it on his wrist, commenting that she looks pretty with her hair down.
Han had no idea it was such an influential scene.
"I had no idea kids were offering up scrunchies to their crushes," she said. "I think it's delightful."
Perhaps adults are unaware of or indifferent to the scrunchie crush craze, but in junior highs and even in some high schools across the country, it appears to be quite a big deal.
The hashtag #Savethescrunchies trended briefly this fall, scrunchie collection funds started by parents of tween girls have started, and undoubtedly any store selling scrunchies is making money off these crushes.
And there are rules, according to Nora Cullerton, a 15-year-old in River Forest, Illinois.
"If a guy is wearing a scrunchie, you know he has a girlfriend," she said. "You can give any color, and the boys will take a Snapchat of the scrunchie and send it to the girl to show them that they're wearing it."
In middle school, Nora said, a girl gives a boy a scrunchie if she likes him. In high school, she gives it to him if they're dating. If the couple is in a nontraditional relationship? Anything could happen.
You may note that the scrunchie-hoodie trade is not an equal one.
After learning of the trend and noticing the scrunchies piling on her son's desk - along with the missing hoodie - Marks told her son that it was ridiculous to give away a hoodie because it's simply not equivalent in monetary value to a scrunchie.
"I mentioned I would totally buy him some scrunchies to give to girls he had crushes on if he wanted me to," Marks said. "Of course he gave me a look that said, 'You're being ridiculous.' "
Mark, 42, said that back in her day they gave each other a mixtape or CD, or even homemade friendship bracelets made out of string.
"I'm guessing sending someone a Spotify playlist just doesn't have the same sentiment?" she said dryly.
Kate Sorensen, the mother of a 12-year-old boy in Ankeny, Iowa, said the scrunchie crush trades are "running rampant" in his sixth grade class. He has arrived home with two so far.
"As for our son giving away a hoodie - he's got plenty to spare, however, I would be really frustrated if he started giving clothes away," Sorensen said.
The two scrunchies he received now live on his desk in his room.
Other tweens are possessive over their scrunchies, given the fact that posh velvet or satin are the styles to get and they can really make a dent in the allowance ($18 for a set of 10 at Urban Outfitters).
Tully Lovell, 10, a fifth grader in River Forest, Illinois, said she hasn't given anyone a scrunchie and doesn't plan on indulging in the fad.
"I like my scrunchies too much," she said.

Texto completo: It's not hard to see what drew two of the finest actors of their generation to play James R. Hoffa. Sure, the man spent decades in the public eye, led what was then the nation's largest labor union, sparred with the Kennedys and disappeared in one of the quintessential unsolved mysteries in recent history. But he's also a great character, a sizzle reel of big, boisterous speeches, roaring dressing-downs and showy theatricality. It's the kind of role an actor can really sink his teeth into, especially if he's known for chewing a bit of scenery - a delicacy frequently enjoyed by both Jack Nicholson, who played the title role in the 1992 "Hoffa," and Al Pacino, currently garnering awards buzz for his work as Hoffa in "The Irishman."
It's frankly surprising it took so long for Hoffa to get the big-screen treatment. "The Enemy Within," Robert F. Kennedy's 1960 book on his congressional mob investigations and dust-ups with Hoffa, was optioned by 20th Century Fox shortly after its publication, with "On the Waterfront" screenwriter Budd Schulberg penning the adaptation. But Ronald Goldfarb, one of Kennedy's colleagues, claimed that it was abandoned because of Teamster intimidation.
So "Hoffa" didn't arrive in theaters until more than three decades later. Though early casting discussions centered, ironically enough, on "The Irishman's" Pacino and Robert De Niro, director Danny DeVito had only one choice: Nicholson, a fellow Jersey boy with whom he had first worked on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." (Both men were also particularly bankable in 1992, thanks to their consecutive turns as Batman villains.) Fox had high hopes for the production, with Joe Roth telling the Los Angeles Times: "Want to hear the early-morning line? Nicholson's 4-to-5 to win the Oscar on this one."
Nicholson did not win the Oscar - he wasn't even nominated, though he was up for supporting actor that year for "A Few Good Men," released two weeks earlier. "Hoffa" needed enthusiastic reviews and solid box office to gather awards momentum, and it found neither; notices were mixed and it barely earned back half of its nearly $50 million budget (about $90 million in today's dollars), which may have been a factor in all those nos from the major studios that led Martin Scorsese to take "The Irishman" to Netflix.
There are, to be sure, some similarities between the films. Both start at the end of the story, near Hoffa's death, and flash back to the events that brought him there; both portray Hoffa as stubborn, combustible, casually anti-Italian, vehemently anti-Kennedy and utterly intolerant of lateness. (Alas, Nicholson's Hoffa indulges in no ice cream sundaes.) But Hoffa, while only a supporting character in "The Irishman," is the focus of "Hoffa," which covers a much larger span of his life, particularly his early, dirty work of making the Teamsters (and himself) a force to be reckoned with.
The two actors diverge markedly in their portrayals. Nicholson immersed himself in the character, taking pains to physically transform himself into the union chief, via nose putty, eyebrow lifts and other makeup tricks: "Lips clamped, jaws screwed down, forehead willed into an unlikely cube, the kisser on Jack Nicholson's Jimmy Hoffa seems sculpted with a wrench," J. Hoberman wrote in The Village Voice. Nicholson further altered his most distinctive feature, his voice, twisting its devilish purr into Hoffa's stridently nasal Midwestern twang ("Dere's a lot more dere for us").
Though Pacino replicates the labor leader's unmistakable haircut, and his raspy voice occasionally finds its way around a Detroit-Chicago dialect, the actor doesn't particularly look or sound like Hoffa in "The Irishman." This is by design. Though he has played several real historical figures in recent years (Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno), he has steered clear of outright impersonation. "You have to find the fictionalization of it in some way," he explained to The New York Times. "You have to find the drama and the character. Because otherwise, do a documentary on someone."
Which is not to say he doesn't do the work. "When you research Hoffa," he told Variety, "there's so much footage on everybody, so you watch it, you study it. You think about it, you engage in it, and you really devote your time to that, who this guy is, and try to absorb him." That last idea is crucial; Pacino "absorbs" Hoffa, but what comes out on-screen is a combination of both their qualities.
This was not always the case. Pacino and his 1970s contemporaries De Niro and Dustin Hoffman were seen, perhaps oversimplistically, as Method-mad chameleons, unrecognizable from role to role. Nicholson, who achieved stardom around the same time, was more in the mold of the classic movie stars, who honed and refined a persona over the course of a career and filtered characters through it; in the decades that followed, he mostly played variations on the madman or the charming rogue (or, sometimes, both simultaneously).
Thus, because his face and (especially) his voice are so familiar, and so rarely vary from character to character, the contrast in "Hoffa" is jarring - this feels less like a performance than an imitation. We're always keenly aware that we're looking at Jack, playing someone else. ("He winds up doing Nicholson shtick in Hoffa makeup," Terrence Rafferty wrote in The New Yorker.) It's somehow easier to accept Pacino as Hoffa, even though his interpretation is rife with his own vocal tics and physical mannerisms, which have become more consistently omnipresent in his performances since ... well, since 1992, when he won the Oscar for "Scent of a Woman," the Oscar that Joe Roth predicted was Nicholson's to lose.
Pacino is, no doubt, aided by the fact that "The Irishman" is a far superior picture to "Hoffa." The latter is handsome and ambitious, but ultimately muddled; the film, and Nicholson's performance, is so focused on externals that it never gives us a sense of the man, or his inner life. Pacino's work may not have the painstaking authenticity of Nicholson's, but it has something more valuable: the richness and humanity of an old pro, unafraid to see this flawed man's qualities in himself.
Caption: Jack Nicholson went for a full-on impersonation of the Teamsters boss, including prosthetics, for his performance in 1992's "Hoffa."
In Martin Scorsese's "The Irishman," Al Pacino steered clear of an outright impersonation of labor leader Jimmy Hoffa.

Texto completo: COSTA MESA, Calif. – A young Kobe Bryant plopped his head on his desk and tried to nap. The star player was tired from the weekend's AAU basketball tournament.
Jeanne Mastriano, who taught English to Bryant during his sophomore and senior years at Lower Merion High School outside Philadelphia, alerted Bryant about his homework assignment. The entire class had to share a short story before a group of kindergarteners. Instead of confessing he forgot, Bryant spent the walk down the hallway brainstorming.
Bryant remembered how his mom constantly told him to put away his dirty clothes after basketball tournaments. He often just swept them under his bed. So he shared his experience on why he should have listened to his mother.
“Those clothes formed together to create these monsters that at nighttime dragged the kid from his bed into the depths of despair,” Bryant recalled to USA TODAY Sports. “We started getting letters from families saying, ‘I don't know what story my kids heard, but their room has never been so clean. ’ I was like, ‘Oh man, this is pretty cool. ’ ”
Talk about Bryant prevailing in the clutch.
Mastriano praised Bryant for his story. It was “relaxed, complete and had a nice arc. ” The moment sparked Bryant’s interest in storytelling.
“She was so good and so passionate about what she was teaching about writing and storytelling,” Bryant said. “She firmly believed that storytelling could change the world. And she opened my eyes to this passion I didn't know existed. ”
What started as a homework assignment has turned into a full-time job following his 20-year NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers. And now, Bryant is set to introduce his fourth book - “The Wizenard Series: Season One” - on March 31. It's the second in a series, written by Wesley King.
Bryant launched Granity Studios, a multi-media content company that has overseen the publication of “The Wizenard Series: Training Camp” (by King), which made The New York Times best seller list; “Legacy of the Queen” (by Annie Matthew); and “Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof" (by Ivy Claire).
Bryant worked with longtime NBA photographer Andy Bernstein on “The Mamba Mentality,” a coffee table book filled with Bryant’s insights on his craft.
“Kobe is beyond dedicated. It’s a really great place to be as a storyteller,” King said. “It’s just a good place to stretch your legs. And to have the backing of Kobe Bryant behind you? That’s not a bad thing, either. ”
Inside Bryant's style as a storyteller
It did not take long for the writers to notice Bryant’s vision and attention to detail.
Bryant contacted Claire because he wanted to work with a published novelist who had been a former professional athlete and had a degree in classic literature. Claire, who also has published work as Ivy Pochoda, majored in classics at Harvard and had been a professional squash player. Then, Bryant detailed his so-called “Granity Bible” that details his mythical world.
“He is incredibly generous with taking my ideas and allowing me to do my thing within his world,” Claire said. “I often expect everything to be taken away because this is his world and his rules, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. ”
KOBE ON TENNIS: NBA icon holds court on Coco
KOBE ON LEBRON: 'Kind of juvenile' to be upset about NBA scoring list
Bryant reached out to King because he read some of his eight published novels, which garnered more than 10 literary awards. The two bonded over their love for Star Wars. During the writing process, Bryant gave King detailed insight into himself as well as his biggest mentors, including former Lakers coach Phil Jackson, former Celtics great Bill Russell, former Lakers assistant Tex Winter and Lower Merion coach Gregg Downer.
“He was remarkably open for you to do your thing,” King said. “Many, many times, he said, ‘You’re the writer. Stretch your legs. ’ So I would obviously really want to reflect his ideas. But as far as the stylistic aspect? I would do my thing, and then he would make small tweaks. ”
Bryant agreed to work with Bernstein after the longtime NBA photographer covered his Lakers career. During his rookie season, Bryant remarked to Bernstein that he knew his name because they were displayed on all the NBA posters he had as a child.
“He makes up his mind and wants things done a certain way,” Bernstein said. “Then it’s your job to make it happen that way. I took that as a great challenge. ”
Bryant wanted his coffee table book to feature photos of himself in different settings, including interactions with certain teammates, matching up against other stars and performing a certain move. That way, Bryant could offer detailed analysis on his thought process. Yet, Bryant sought Bernstein’s input, too.
“There was zero push/pull. There were photos that were important to me that might not have fit the quote-unquote narrative of the book. But he respected that they needed to be in the book because they were important to me,” Bernstein said. “It was the most generous thing any athlete has done for me ever. ”
The process was not always easy, though.
Bryant said it took about four years to work on “Epoca: The Tree of Ecrof”. Bryant and Claire exchanged text messages at all hours to crystalize what his world would become.
When Bryant sensed skepticism from traditional publishers, he decided to self-publish and hire an additional freelance editor (Noa Wheeler). Bryant asked Claire to visit the Greek Islands to further enhance her understanding of Greek mythology and architecture.
The process with King played out differently. Bryant had an easier time formulating the vision for “The Wizenard Series” because it involved basketball, but that yielded other complications. Bryant estimated that “it probably took us 15 passes with writing the first chapter” because of the evolving storylines.
“Training Camp” eventually became five separate books in one with each section centering on the protagonist Rain (whom Bryant identifies with) and the perspective of different teammates, including Twig, Cash, Lab and Peño. Their coach, Rolabi Wizenard, is a composite character of Bryant’s mentors in Jackson, Russell, Winter and Downer.
Their latest book centers on Reggie, who is another player that has struggled with his game and self-esteem. Though King based his research on Bryant and watching interviews, King also traveled to West Philadelphia to follow an AAU team and speak with sports psychologists.
“What I had was an idea and I knew where I wanted the characters to go," Bryant said. "I know where they should start, and I know where they should end by the time this series is over. . . . I had an idea, but I knew that they could make it a thousand times better. So it was just kind of sitting back, sharing these ideas and just figuring it out. ”

Texto completo: 'The Special Counsel'
By Mark Caro, Mulholland, 336 pages, $16.99
Mark Caro's new book, "The Special Counsel," has a cover design straight out of a John Grisham thriller. It sports a bold, red title; the Capitol dome set against an ominously dark sky; and a U.S. Department of Justice seal.
The tagline reads, "If you're listening, Russia ...," a call back to a 2016 news conference, when then-presidential candidateDonald Trumpseemingly called for Russia to hack his opponent Hillary Clinton's server.
"The Special Counsel" adapts Robert S. Mueller III's Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, framing it as a narrative while maintaining the source material's factuality.
At a recent event at the Book Cellar in Lincoln Square, Caro addressed the elusive categorization of "The Special Counsel." Distributors have labeled it "fiction-crime" and "fiction-historical." Mulholland Books, Caro's publisher, calls it "current events/politics."
Before the Book Cellar event, Caro -- a former Chicago Tribune entertainment reporter and author of the "The Foie Gras Wars" -- spoke by phone about his new book. Here is an edited transcript of our conversation.
Q: Your book reminded me of an old Woody Allen joke about working on a nonfiction version of The Warren Report. "The Special Counsel" flips that, but it's not quite a novelization. How do you describe it?
A: It is a readable version of the Mueller report. It restructures the report as a narrative: This is what happened, and this is what people did. This is definitely a journalistic endeavor; everything is sourced.
The fictional aspect is the conceit that Robert Mueller is narrating it. This whole idea of novelizing it would have required sentences like, "It was rainy and 45 degrees when Jeff Sessions made his way to his office." I didn't have time to research the weather.
Q: You also flesh out the report with related indictments, public accounts and social media posts. For example, the Mueller report contains a one-sentence reference to Matt Skiber, a concoction of Russia's Internet Research Agency. Your book contains the complete Facebook post in which this fake person reached out to actual Trump supporters to organize a "YUGE pro-Trump flash mob."
A: That was the constant process: to give the report more context. I printed out the report as a PDF and had it on my screen. I would check out a footnote, such as an Oval Office meeting with The New York Times, print out the transcript from the newspaper and include a whole quote or the actual (interview) exchange.
Another example is a mention in the report of (then-press secretary) Sean Spicer speaking to reporters late at night the day former FBI Director James Comey was fired. That was the night he was out on the White House lawn talking to Fox (Business), and when he saw other reporters (approaching) he went into the bushes. I think it's more interesting to read about him negotiating to come out of the bushes.
Q: You are best known as an arts writer. What was the trigger for you to write this?
A: I was contacted by an editor at Little, Brown who had this idea. I've tried to be up on the report and read the news. I want to be informed. My wife, Mary Dixon (recently hired as morning news anchor on WBEZ's "Morning Edition"), was a nut on the whole Mueller report and had actually printed it out and read through the whole thing with a highlighter. This was before I was even asked to do this book.
When I told her that they had this idea, her eyes lit up and she said she could help. I was pretty much on my own on "The Foie Gras Wars." She was my secret weapon on this.
Q: This could have lent itself to satire. How did you find the book's voice?
A: My editor and I had a long discussion about how to present this. Do you write it from the point of view of Mueller? Do you write it from the point of view of someone who functions as an audience surrogate, like Nick Carraway from "The Great Gatsby" -- a member of Mueller's staff?
It seemed the most straightforward way was to put it in Mueller's voice. His motivation would be that people are misinterpreting his work, which must have burned him up.
Q: What was your impression of your protagonist?
A: I remember watching his testimony and his press conference and I thought, This guy is not so expansive. It's wishful thinking he would sit down and lay this all out. But I do think he wants people to pay attention to his work, and the book is in that spirit.
Q: The Mueller report did not get the greatest reviews for style. CNN said the writers were "able ..., but Stephen King they are not."Is this book a conscious attempt to make the report more accessible?
A: Yes, absolutely. And the editor was very serious about it. Maybe you think it's OK what they did and maybe you don't, but this is what your elected officials were doing and this is what a foreign government -- our chief adversary for the last five decades -- was doing to our electoral system.
You read it, and it's like, Holy crap, I didn't realize the Russians were creating fake Black Lives Matter Twitter accounts urging not to vote for Hillary. We should know about this, and here's a way to get this material without slogging through this very dry report.
Q: Did writing this book give you a better grasp on the implications of the report?
A: It was eye-opening. A lot of the headlines when the Mueller report was released were about Trump and obstruction, but it's scary when you read about the extent of interference by the Russians in the 2016 presidential election -- all of the fake Facebook and Twitter accounts and the lies and propaganda that they perpetrated on the American public. That's the reason that Mueller said this is ongoing, this is what people need to be vigilant about. Now, I can't look at tweets and responses on Twitter without thinking, How many are Russian trolls or bots?
Q: When you wrote this book, President Trump had not been impeached. The Senate trial has begun. Events have far outpaced the original report.
A: But it's necessary if you want to have the background on what is going on. It's like all those crazy things that happened in season two of "Breaking Bad." The Mueller report is season one. You have to watch from the beginning.
Q: Who do you envision is your audience for this?
A: The whole reason you go into journalism is because you think uncovering the truth will make the world a better place; the more knowledge out there, the better. If someone is (of the mindset that) Trump can do no wrong, they are not interested in hearing the facts, but there are a lot of people who are not closed-minded. They want to know what's going on.
And I've received a great response to this. When I tell people I'm writing a readable version of the Mueller report, their eyes light up as if to say, Great, we need that.

For red states, a climate disaster by another name

Texto completo: The Trump administration is about to distribute billions of dollars to coastal states mainly in the South to help steel them against natural disasters worsened by climate change.
But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.
A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn't use the terms "climate change" or "global warming," nor does South Carolina's proposal. Instead, Texas refers to "changing coastal conditions" and South Carolina talks about the "destabilizing effects and unpredictability" of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.
Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase "climate change" in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.
The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.
The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven't yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.
The money is distributed according to a formula benefitting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.
Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana, $1.2 billion; Florida, $633 million; North Carolina, $168 million; and South Carolina, $158 million, all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.
The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn't yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.
Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding, citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.
Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida's proposal calls it "a key overarching challenge," while North Carolina pledges to anticipate "how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects" will affect state residents.
The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program's goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn't use the terms "climate change" and "global warming" but referred to "changing environmental conditions."
Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their "current and future risks." And when those risks included flooding -- the most costly type of disaster nationwide -- states were instructed to account for "continued sea level rise," which is one consequence of global warming.
A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.
Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was "a case of picking your battles."
"When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not," Gimont said. "You've got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it's best to draw a middle road on these things."
Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. "Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards," wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control the legislature and the governor's office.

Texto completo: Christine Motokane could receive long-term care to help her with daily tasks like cooking. Matthew Cortland could marry his longtime partner. Christin Lucas could stop worrying that her son's school might put him back in the isolated classrooms that made him suicidal.
This is some of what's at stake in a newly prominent debate over disability policy. For months, Democratic presidential candidates have built on one another in this arena, culminating last week with a plan from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts whose scope shocked many advocates.
That plan and the way Warren developed it, with a working group of about a dozen people with disabilities, reflect a sea change. More presidential candidates than ever are acknowledging how many issues, from criminal justice to student debt, affect people with disabilities, who make up a quarter of the country's adult population. And more people with disabilities are shaping the policies that could affect them.
Warren is not the only candidate with a new approach. Several activists praised Julián Castro, the former housing secretary who ended his campaign and endorsed Warren this month, for his attention to disability policy. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has an extensive plan.
And Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota released a proposal Friday -- developed with disability rights groups, her campaign said -- that would, among other things, expand home- and community-based services, make technologies like speech-generating devices more accessible, increase Social Security disability payments and strengthen anti-discrimination laws.
But the disability community has responded most positively to Warren's plan.
"It is the most comprehensive thing I have seen in my 20 years of looking at these things," said Jason Dorwart, a theater professor at Oberlin College who is quadriplegic.
The plan is sprawling, touching on health care, education, employment, Social Security, technology, housing, incarceration, police brutality and environmental justice.
It overlaps with other candidates' plans: For instance, Warren, Buttigieg, Klobuchar, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont all want to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which is meant to guarantee free public education for children with disabilities, and end the subminimum wage, which allows some workers with disabilities to be paid cents an hour based on the argument that it will make employers more likely to hire them.
But in other areas, Warren's plan goes further.
Several candidates want to change rules that keep recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income in poverty, but Warren's proposal is particularly detailed, including on eligibility and income limits. Advocates also noted sections on helping deaf children learn language skills and on the threats people with disabilities face in police encounters and natural disasters, as well as the plan's attention to how disability and race are linked.
Warren has said she had asked her staff to create the group after hearing from people with disabilities at her campaign events.
"The personal stories caused us to rethink parts of current federal policy that badly need to be rewritten," she said in an interview.
Warren "sees that things like the plastic straw ban or the California wildfires all have disability rights components," said Jasmine Harris, a professor of law at the University of California, Davis. "Disability is a lens by which we can view how certain issues disproportionately impact people with disabilities. That is the disability scholar's dream, to hear that."
People with disabilities described how plans like Warren's could change their lives.
Motokane, 27, who has autism, said she had sought Medicaid coverage for an aide to help her with things like cooking, budgeting and transportation. But her salary as a school paraprofessional in rural Washington state puts her above the income limit for that coverage -- a limit Warren wants to raise.
Another rule Warren wants to change limits the assets SSI recipients can have so that marrying someone with, say, $5,000 in a retirement account means losing benefits. Because of that, Cortland, a lawyer who was part of the working group, can't afford to marry his partner of 12 years.
In interviews with a dozen activists and people with disabilities, only one criticism of Warren's plan was raised: its lack of an explicit commitment to inclusive education, in which children with disabilities are taught in regular classrooms with accommodations, not in separate special-education rooms. Several studies have shown that children do better academically and socially under inclusive education.
Warren, who has often spoken about her experience as a special-education teacher, is committed to inclusive education, her campaign said, adding that several elements of her plan -- including more funding for paraprofessionals -- would promote it. But her plan sets no targets or timeline for that.
By contrast, Buttigieg's plan says that by the end of the 2025 school year, 85% of students with "intellectual and multiple disabilities" should be spending 80% or more of the school day in a regular classroom.
Lucas, of Bay Village, Ohio, said that when her son Bobby, who has Down syndrome, was put in a separate classroom in second grade, he became so depressed that he said he would kill himself. Bobby is now in fifth grade and in a regular classroom, and Lucas said that he was doing well -- but that she was constantly afraid a new administrator could remove him.
"Just because that segregated room exists, it's a constant threat for him," she said.
Many of the candidates' proposals would require congressional approval, which could be a challenge if a Democrat is elected president but Republicans control either chamber. For instance, one current piece of legislation, the Disability Integration Act, has 34 co-sponsors, but only two are Republicans. And the Trump administration is trying to move in the opposite direction by subjecting SSI and SSDI recipients to more frequent reviews of whether they still have severe enough disabilities.
Even so, Cal Montgomery, 52, an activist in Chicago who has autism and uses a wheelchair, said proposals like Warren's -- as well as Buttigieg's, Castro's and Sanders' -- had given people with disabilities something they had long lacked: clarity on how candidates would help or hurt them.

Texto completo: 'Cleanness'
By Garth Greenwell, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 223 pages. $26
"Physical love is unthinkable without violence," Milan Kundera wrote in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being." Some of the most essential recent fiction has surveyed the pain and pleasure of being on the receiving end of violent physical expression. There's been a lot to absorb about submission.
In Sally Rooney's impeccable novels, women yearn to be tied or beaten or choked or otherwise degraded; for intricate reasons, they feel they deserve no better.
The intensities of submission are a theme in Ocean Vuong's novel "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous." There's a hair-pulling and hair-raising sex scene. The participants recognize something feral in each other. In Alan Hollinghurst's recent novel "The Sparsholt Affair," sex gives way to commentary about "the slight invalidish luxury of having been had."
These are hardly new themes, in literature or anywhere else. In Toni Morrison's "Sula," the protagonist "went to bed with men as frequently as she could" because "it was the only place where she could find what she was looking for: misery and the ability to feel deep sorrow."
Yet perhaps, in a world that feels freshly broken, there is a renewed desire to be brought low.
Early in Garth Greenwell's incandescent second novel, "Cleanness," there's a sex scene between two anonymous men who've met online. The setting is Sofia, Bulgaria. An American teacher in middle age arrives at an apartment to meet a man who is older, overweight, unhandsome, a brute.
The sex that results is pulverizing. "With great force he spat into my face" is the start of it. There are leashes and cat-o'-nine tails, choking and well-aimed kicking. What the teacher feels is gratitude. He is recovering from a failed relationship; he is seeking a "force that can make me such a stranger to myself." He says, "I want to be nothing."
One of the profound things about the online world, he thinks, is that you can "call out for anything you desire, however aberrant or unlikely, and nearly always there comes an answer; it's a large world, we're never as solitary as we think."
Anyone who read Greenwell's first novel, "What Belongs to You" (2016), knows that his writing about sex is altogether scorching. You pick his novels up with asbestos mitts, and set them down upon trivets to protect your table from heat damage.
There's a moral quality to these extended sessions. In bed is where Greenwell's men work out and reveal the essences of their personalities.
Sex scenes are the hinges of Greenwell's novels, as they are of Kundera's. These writers also share a certain heavy-heartedness, in addition to gray Eastern European settings. Carnal moments are accelerants; they're where Greenwell's existential and political themes are underlined, then set ablaze.
Greenwell's first novel was also set in Sofia; it, too, was about an American teacher living there. The slim books are similar in content and tone. There's been some grumbling among readers I know, as this novel's arrival detonates across the landscape, that they're too similar.
This complaint, to my mind, is easily dismissed. Greenwell extends his reach in "Cleanness." It's a better, richer, more confident novel. You intuit its seriousness and grace from its first pages. It's a novel in search of ravishment.
Greenwell's teacher spends a lot of time with younger men, many of them students or former students. He admires their beauty. They remind him of his younger self. Some are gay in a country where it is nearly impossible to come out of the closet, and he longs to tell them that it gets better.
Greenwell is a sensitive writer about the student-teacher relationship. "My profession is a kind of long looking," he writes, yet in other ways the students are "entirely opaque" to him.
At another moment, the narrator thinks: "That's the worst thing about teaching, that our actions either have no force at all or have force beyond all intention." He adds that "the consequences echo across years and silence, we can never really know what we've done."
The teacher rejoices in "the company of these boys." He loiters around them and longs to touch them. He goes with them to clubs. He takes a much younger lover. The book becomes about travel, self-exile, political protest and the demands of long-distance relationships.
If you switched some of the pronouns in "Cleanness," if this book were about a lusty straight male teacher elatedly mingling with vastly younger female students, why would we view it differently? Does this novel evade some of the questions it raises? Am I evading these questions right now?
"Cleanness" is related in nine chapters that can be read individually, as if they were short stories. Greenwell has an uncanny gift. Every detail in every scene glows with meaning. It's as if, while other writers offer data, he is providing metadata.
Students and instructors, dominants and submissives. As "Cleanness" moves forward, as if in a game of chess, positions are castled. Who is the emcee, and who is the contestant? The teacher finds himself doing things he never suspected he might.
This novel is, in part, about memory and nostalgia. (The narrator grew up in the American South.) It is also about shame. "I knew I felt something I shouldn't feel," is a typical comment. The narrator feels "the shame that felt like home."
Most fundamentally, it's about putting two people together and squeezing out sparks.

Texto completo: Mark Caro's new book, "The Special Counsel," has a cover design straight out of a John Grisham thriller. It sports a bold, red title; the Capitol dome set against an ominously dark sky; and a U.S. Department of Justice seal.
The tagline reads, "If you're listening, Russia ...," a call back to a 2016 news conference, when then-presidential candidateDonald Trumpseemingly called for Russia to hack his opponent Hillary Clinton's server.
"The Special Counsel" adapts Robert S. Mueller III's Report on the Investigation Into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, framing it as a narrative while maintaining the source material's factuality.
At a recent event at the Book Cellar in Lincoln Square, Caro addressed the elusive categorization of "The Special Counsel." Distributors have labeled it "fiction-crime" and "fiction-historical." Mulholland Books, Caro's publisher, calls it "current events/politics."
Before the Book Cellar event, Caro -- a former Chicago Tribune entertainment reporter and author of the "The Foie Gras Wars" -- spoke by phone about his new book. Here is an edited transcript of our conversation.
Q: Your book reminded me of an old Woody Allen joke about working on a nonfiction version of The Warren Report. "The Special Counsel" flips that, but it's not quite a novelization. How do you describe it?
A: It is a readable version of the Mueller report. It restructures the report as a narrative: This is what happened, and this is what people did. This is definitely a journalistic endeavor; everything is sourced.
The fictional aspect is the conceit that Robert Mueller is narrating it. This whole idea of novelizing it would have required sentences like, "It was rainy and 45 degrees when Jeff Sessions made his way to his office." I didn't have time to research the weather.
Q: You also flesh out the report with related indictments, public accounts and social media posts. For example, the Mueller report contains a one-sentence reference to Matt Skiber, a concoction of Russia's Internet Research Agency. Your book contains the complete Facebook post in which this fake person reached out to actual Trump supporters to organize a "YUGE pro-Trump flash mob."
A: That was the constant process: to give the report more context. I printed out the report as a PDF and had it on my screen. I would check out a footnote, such as an Oval Office meeting with The New York Times, print out the transcript from the newspaper and include a whole quote or the actual (interview) exchange.
Another example is a mention in the report of (then-press secretary) Sean Spicer speaking to reporters late at night the day former FBI Director James Comey was fired. That was the night he was out on the White House lawn talking to Fox (Business), and when he saw other reporters (approaching) he went into the bushes. I think it's more interesting to read about him negotiating to come out of the bushes.
Q: You are best known as an arts writer. What was the trigger for you to write this?
A: I was contacted by an editor at Little, Brown who had this idea. I've tried to be up on the report and read the news. I want to be informed. My wife, Mary Dixon (recently hired as morning news anchor on WBEZ's "Morning Edition"), was a nut on the whole Mueller report and had actually printed it out and read through the whole thing with a highlighter. This was before I was even asked to do this book.
When I told her that they had this idea, her eyes lit up and she said she could help. I was pretty much on my own on "The Foie Gras Wars." She was my secret weapon on this.
Q: This could have lent itself to satire. How did you find the book's voice?
A: My editor and I had a long discussion about how to present this. Do you write it from the point of view of Mueller? Do you write it from the point of view of someone who functions as an audience surrogate, like Nick Carraway from "The Great Gatsby" -- a member of Mueller's staff?
It seemed the most straightforward way was to put it in Mueller's voice. His motivation would be that people are misinterpreting his work, which must have burned him up.
Q: What was your impression of your protagonist?
A: I remember watching his testimony and his press conference and I thought, This guy is not so expansive. It's wishful thinking he would sit down and lay this all out. But I do think he wants people to pay attention to his work, and the book is in that spirit.
Q: The Mueller report did not get the greatest reviews for style. CNN said the writers were "able ..., but Stephen King they are not."Is this book a conscious attempt to make the report more accessible?
A: Yes, absolutely. And the editor was very serious about it. Maybe you think it's OK what they did and maybe you don't, but this is what your elected officials were doing and this is what a foreign government -- our chief adversary for the last five decades -- was doing to our electoral system.
You read it, and it's like, Holy crap, I didn't realize the Russians were creating fake Black Lives Matter Twitter accounts urging not to vote for Hillary. We should know about this, and here's a way to get this material without slogging through this very dry report.
Q: Did writing this book give you a better grasp on the implications of the report?
A: It was eye-opening. A lot of the headlines when the Mueller report was released were about Trump and obstruction, but it's scary when you read about the extent of interference by the Russians in the 2016 presidential election -- all of the fake Facebook and Twitter accounts and the lies and propaganda that they perpetrated on the American public. That's the reason that Mueller said this is ongoing, this is what people need to be vigilant about. Now, I can't look at tweets and responses on Twitter without thinking, How many are Russian trolls or bots?
Q: When you wrote this book, President Trump had not been impeached. The Senate trial has begun. Events have far outpaced the original report.
A: But it's necessary if you want to have the background on what is going on. It's like all those crazy things that happened in season two of "Breaking Bad." The Mueller report is season one. You have to watch from the beginning.
Q: Who do you envision is your audience for this?
A: The whole reason you go into journalism is because you think uncovering the truth will make the world a better place; the more knowledge out there, the better. If someone is (of the mindset that) Trump can do no wrong, they are not interested in hearing the facts, but there are a lot of people who are not closed-minded. They want to know what's going on.
And I've received a great response to this. When I tell people I'm writing a readable version of the Mueller report, their eyes light up as if to say, Great, we need that.

Texto completo: As a small boy in Denison, Texas, I remember vividly the anguish of being called on in grade school, knowing that I was going to have a hard time getting the words out; that my words could not keep up with my mind, and they would often come out jumbled. My neck and face would quickly begin to flush a bright red, the searing heat rising all the way to the top of my head; every eye in the room on me; the intense and painful humiliation, and bullying that would follow, all because of my inability to get the words out.
Those feelings came rushing back, when I heard Lara Trump mocking former Vice President Joe Biden at a Trump campaign event, with the very words that caused my childhood agony. "Joe, can you get it out?" Ms. Trump was seen saying onstage, as a few giggles are heard from an otherwise silent audience. "Let's get the words out, Joe."
In the interest of full disclosure, I attended a fundraiser last year for the Biden campaign, but this issue goes beyond politics. Regardless of how you feel about Joe Biden, or his chances of becoming the Democratic nominee for president; whether you are a Republican, a Democrat, or none of the above; whether you stuttered as a child or laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own stuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president's daughter-in-law; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. People who can't, have no place in public life.
What might a child who stutters, as I did, feel when they hear a grown-up on a public stage trying to make a bunch of other adults laugh by ridiculing a public figure who also stutters? This culture of cruelty is what drives decent people from public service, and what makes millions of Americans recoil from politics, and even from participating in our democracy. Vice President Biden has spoken openly — and courageously, in my view — about the pain of his childhood stutter.
As I grew older, I learned to manage and overcome my stuttering. I learned to slow down and to enunciate each word with precision. I joined the church choir, and found that singing helped me to practice controlling my breath, and the formation of words. I learned to resist and overcome the bullying.
I also learned that our imperfections do not define us. The fact that I once stuttered did not keep me from being a successful U.S. Air Force fighter pilot, an airline pilot, or even a public speaker.
And on that frigid day in January 2009, when I had to tell the air traffic controller at New York Departure Control that I was about to land US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River, after a bird strike following takeoff caused both engines to fail, my words came out with precision and control.
So, to every child who feels today, what I felt, after hearing those cruel remarks by an adult who should know better, here is what I want you to know:
You are fine, just as you are. You can do any job you dream of when you grow up. You can be a pilot who lands your plane on a river and helps save lives, or a president who treats people with respect, rather than making fun of them. You can become a teacher to kids who stutter. A speech disorder is a lot easier to treat than a character defect. You become a true leader, not because of how you speak, but because of what you have to say — and the challenges you have overcome to help others. Ignore kids (and adults) who are mean, or don't know what it feels like to stutter. Respond by showing them how to be kind, polite, respectful and generous, to be brave enough to try big things, even though you are not perfect.]
Do that, and the sky is the limit. Take it from me.

Texto completo: ATHENS, Ohio - The Plains is a blip on the radar, a small speck on the map that all but defines rural southeast Ohio.
The Appalachian foothills surround one of the only flat areas in Athens County, located a few miles from the Hocking River. There is a Valero to grab some fuel.
If you're hungry, there is a newly renovated McDonald's, a Subway and, of course, the now famous Gigi's Country Kitchen. And lest we forget the sparkling new Piggly Wiggly.
But the centerpiece is Athens High School, the place LSU quarterback Joe Burrow made a household name. Southeast Ohio's first Heisman Trophy winner, and potential No. 1 pick in the NFL Draft, is the crown jewel of a region that has never been confused with breeding football legends.
Make no mistake though, that's exactly what "Joey" is here.
Hometown hero Burrow and his unbeaten Tigers beat Clemson 42-25 on Jan. 13. His record-breaking numbers at the college level look a lot like the numbers from his days in Athens.
Burrow passed for 63 touchdowns as a senior, part of a career that saw him surpass 11,000 career yards and throw 157 TDs. For good measure, he added 2,067 yards rushing, as his talent-laden Bulldogs reached the Division III state finals in his final season.
Those Bulldogs produced arguably the best team in the history of southeast Ohio, one that featured four Division I college signees in a spread offense resembling plenty of similarities to that of his current operation.
"They were just a bunch of real good guys, a bunch of good kids and really were like a big family," said former Athens athletic director Chuck Robinson, a member of the Marietta College Athletic Hall of Fame.
"It was his intensity," Robinson said, when asked what he remembered most about Burrow. "He cared about what he was doing and always wanted to be the best at what he was doing. He was special early. He could do a lot of things that people just couldn't do."
That included a football rarity. In the 2014 regional finals against Columbus DeSales, his senior season, he threw a touchdown to himself in a 52-20 win that clinched the school's first final four appearance.
"The linebacker knocked it down and it went right back to him," Robinson recalled. "He just caught it and ran it into the end zone. That was the key moment right there."
The Bulldogs lost in the finals to private school power Toledo Central Catholic two weeks later, but Burrow didn't go down without a fight. That 56-52 loss, the first in Ohio Stadium in 25 years, featured championship game records 446 yards and six TDs from Burrow. More than 10,000 fans attended.
It came one day after being named Ohio's Mr. Football, an award won by the likes of Charles Woodson, Maurice Clarett and Mitchell Trubisky. Former Minnesota Vikings running back Robert Smith won it twice.
The success never went to his head, Robinson said. "He's grounded and his parents (Jimmy and Robin) are real grounded, too," Robinson said.
The 31 percent poverty rate in Athens County is the highest in Ohio. The opioid crisis has hit here as hard as anywhere in the region.
Ohio University, in Athens, has long doubled as a local source of pride and vital employer. It is Ohio's fourth-largest university by enrollment.
But it's tough here, as Burrow pointed out in a heartfelt Heisman speech that brought many to tears, especially in his hometown. It was in New York, before a nationwide audience on ESPN, where he spoke of the poverty and hunger problems saddling the area.
Born in Ames, Iowa, he moved to Ohio at 9 after his father, who played at Nebraska under Tom Osborne, was hired by OU coach Frank Solich as the Bobcats' defensive coordinator in 2005.
Burrow saw firsthand the struggles many of his schoolmates encountered.
"Coming from southeast Ohio, the poverty rate is almost twice the national average," Burrow said. "There are so many people there who don't have a lot, and I'm up here for all those kids in Athens and Athens County who go home to not a lot of food on the table, hungry after school. You guys can be up here, too."
Little did he know what would follow.
Shortly after, Athens High and OU grad Will Drabold took to Facebook to start a fundraiser for the Athens County Food Pantry. It started with a goal of $1,000; as of Jan. 6, it had raised $500,966 with donations pouring in from across the country. A separate fundraiser brought in donations to Baton Rouge, where LSU is located.
Since then, Athens County Food Pantry President Karin Bright has been deluged with interview requests from media types wondering just how much impact the generosity created. The food pantry serves around 1,200 people, with an annual budget of around $80,000.
"I checked (on Monday) and there were donations from Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana and Ohio, and that was just from over the weekend," Bright said. "What he said touched the hearts of so many people. It shows the kind of person he is. Beyond the fact that he's been a real winner on the field, for him to use his platform and his voice to address such a huge problem in this country — this is not just in Athens. It's out in California, in the desert in Arizona and the mountains in Wyoming. It's across the board."
She said the Food Pantry board met with attorneys to discuss the future of what would be done with the surplus of funds. There are multiple options, from sharing with other organizations to creating endowments. They hope to come up with a final solution soon.
Almost a month later, Bright was still wrapping her head around the whirlwind . She couldn't thank Burrow enough, calling his thoughtfulness "refreshing to see from successful athlete," especially in this age of self-promotion and bloated egos.
It wasn't the first time Burrow gave a passionate speech.
The freshman son of United Appeals of Athens County Executive Director Jennifer Eskey was part of the Athens High program when Burrow was a senior. She listened as he addressed the overflowing crowd at the team's postseason banquet.
"All of the seniors got to talk," Eskey recalled. "Joey went up to talk and he was so emotional. I don't think I've ever seen an 18-year-old be that compassionate about something ever. Just the team, the family and where they've went and how close they all are, and how much he was going to miss it. It stuck with me.
The Heisman speech, and its purpose, was merely a continuance of his empathy for others, Eskey said. "Every now and then you'll hear people talk negatively about people using their platform for their own, and here is this kid who chose to take it off of him and put it to where it's needed," Eskey said. "What kid does that? ... That's his compassion. He has done what he can to help, and if you look back, how many people have done that?"
Athens grad Greg Hopkins has been a regular at Gigi's, which has been a bustling place since Burrow's 2018 interview with ESPN reporter Marty Smith that mentioned Burrow's favorite place to eat back home.
"It's great," Burrow told Smith. "Gigi's is my favorite breakfast place in Athens. Western omelet, double side of hash browns every time I go home."
Travis Brand, owner of Gigi's, has been deluged with calls and interviews from media wanting to know the story about Burrow and his go-to restaurant.
Brand called Burrow's climb "a whirlwind," adding he never opened a restaurant with any preconceived notions that he'd be doing interviews with the likes of ESPN, CBS and the New York Times.
WBRZ-TV, from Baton Rouge, even followed them to a tailgate when they attended the Texas A&M game earlier in the year.
"It's the Joe Burrow World, we're just living in it," Brand said.

Texto completo: Pat Cipollone isn't a household name.
But that could soon change.
The 1984 Covington Catholic graduate's work as the lead attorney of President Donald Trump's defense team has placed him at the center of the impeachment drama.
He may now be a witness in the trial.
As the third impeachment trial in United States' history began Tuesday (Jan. 21), House Democrats issued a letter demanding Cipollone reveal any firsthand knowledge he has related to the two articles of impeachment.
"In light of your extensive knowledge of these key events, your personal representation of President Trump threatens to undermine the integrity of the pending trial," the letter reads. It is signed by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Mass., the lead impeachment manager in the House and six other Democratic members of Congress serving as impeachment managers.
The heart of the issue, according to the Democrats in the letter, is Cipollone's role as a White House attorney and supervisor to John Eisenberg, a deputy counsel to the president for National Security Affairs.
Witnesses testified in the House investigation they brought concerns to Eisenberg shortly after Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That's the call in whicih the president asked Zelensky to investigate the son of Trump's political rival, Hunter Biden.
The House Democrats in the letter also accuse Cipollone of withholding the whistleblower's complaint from Congress and directing witnesses not to testify.
"Your office was also directly involved in potential efforts to conceal President Trump's scheme from Congress and the public," the letter stated.
Cipollone, 53, spent much of his childhood in the Bronx borough of New York City as the son of a factory worker, according to a New York Times profile. When his father was transferred to Kentucky, Cipollone attended Covington Catholic High School.
He then moved back to New York to attend Fordham University.
He has spent most of his 30-year career in Washington and Chicago.

Trying to keep voices fit Loud, frequent fitness classes take toll on instructors, who must work to avoid damage to vocal cords

Texto completo: Coco Cohen is a triathlete. She has competed in Ironman competitions, has a black belt in karate and is a trained sword fighter.
But nothing could quite prepare her for the trials of shouting at top volume all day, several days a week, to her classes at New York City's Columbus Circle Equinox health club, where she is a manager and group fitness instructor. It turns out that shouting repeated encouragements during spin class - "Rise out of the saddle and push!" or "Trust yourself!" - is an occupational hazard.
"I sounded like Kathleen Turner on a downward spiral," said Cohen, who, in a compounding irony, is also a trained professional singer. As her voice grew huskier and the nodes on her vocal cords grew more callused, it took just one cough - the kind you make when water goes down the wrong pipe - for Cohen to get vocal paralysis. She could barely speak above a whisper, if at all, and had the same type of surgery that Julie Andrews had in 1997 after starring in "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway. (Andrews' surgery was botched and left her unable to sing, but Cohen described hers as successful.)
Talk to surgeons and speech language pathologists, and you quickly learn that there's a whole universe of professionals at risk for vocal damage whose job descriptions, technically, do not emphasize the use of their voices at all. Like teachers, for instance. Also lawyers. And a growing number of group fitness instructors like Cohen.
"This is a group that is so mindful of being healthy and taking care of their bodies, but their voices are really neglected," said Leanne Goldberg, director of Grabscheid Voice and Swallowing Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
Comprehensive data on this particular population is limited, but a small body of evidence suggests that fitness instructors are now among those at high risk. In 2016, Christine Estes, a speech language pathologist at the Weill Cornell Medicine Sean Parker Institute for the Voice, noticed that her patients featured a recurring cast of fitness instructors. She decided to conduct a study of them over a two-year period. What she discovered amazed her: They had polyps. They had nodules. They had hemorrhages. Real damage to the vocal cords that needed real treatment. All 24 were referred for behavioral treatment, and 10 opted to have surgery.
Instructors typically average around 15 classes per week, some starting as early as 5 a.m. Many lead several classes back-to-back, with almost no breaks in between. Throughout the day, they're shouting directives - often while demonstrating the moves they're describing - over loud, upbeat music and, in some cases, competing with the noise coming from treadmills, stationary bikes and clanging weights.
Most of all, they're motivating their clients to push themselves, and that motivation generally takes the form of volume. And while most instructors do wear microphones, those devices may not help much if the studio has a low-quality sound system, or if the instructors don't know how to use them to their vocal advantage. A result: Many instructors compromise their vocal health by giving what is a very taxing performance.
Complicating matters even further, the fitness industry has grown more competitive in recent years - in no small part because gym members can rate their instructors online, leaving reviews that someone was "inspiring." As the industry becomes more exacting, so do instructors' appetites to be the very best at their jobs. New instructors "are hungry," Cohen said. "They'll teach class after class, and I've started to warn them: Your voice will be gone."
Patrick Frost, now a Nike Master trainer and the creator of Frostfit, started his fitness career nearly a decade ago at Barry's Bootcamp, a full-body treadmill-and-weights workout studio with locations around the world. He quickly rose through the ranks and, by his account, was teaching close to 22 classes per week.
"Talk to any other instructor," he says. "If you say you teach 22 Barry's Bootcamp classes a week, they'll tell you 'that's insane.' " Which is probably why, about two years into his job, Frost was frantically casting around for last-minute subs and calling in sick.
"Sometimes I'd wake up and not even know if I had a voice," he said. He soon discovered he had major vocal cord polyps, with some hemorrhaging. To conserve his voice, Frost often found himself choosing between his career and his social life. He eventually had surgery in 2015. As part of his recovery, Frost had to be diligent about his at-home exercises, warming up his voice by doing trills and repeating lines he'd say to his classes ("My name is Patrick Frost, Frost like the snowman") at various volumes and pitches.
Stories like Frost's are becoming more common as the industry expands. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for trainers is projected to grow 13% by 2028, faster than most occupations.) Take the case of Gerren Liles, for instance. He works not only for Equinox, but also for Mirror, a fitness startup that streams fitness classes right into a person's home (via a special wall-mounted mirror - hence the name). With that, Liles' class load went from 14 per week to 25. Even before joining Mirror, he had vocal problems, and his expanded schedule only exacerbated them. Liles said that when it became "really, really painful," he underwent surgery this past March.
Many fitness instructors work freelance and may not have health insurance that covers treatment for vocal injuries. If they defer treatment, the damage can get worse. Instructors and experts alike say that education about vocal health should be required for new hires.
Some trainers are taking the initiative independently. At Equinox Columbus Circle, for example, Cohen said that she and a colleague organized a few sessions for other instructors focused on vocal health and made some information available to other instructors online.
Practicing good vocal hygiene includes staying hydrated; keeping studio music at lower levels; reducing unnecessary patter; and, when possible, leaving space between classes. Most important, though, it means instructors must develop the same vocal habits as professional singers. Namely, they need to warm up. A few minutes of humming, lip trills or resonance exercises can go a long way. And Estes recommends keeping most headset microphones two finger-widths from the corner of the mouth, but this can vary based on the amplification system.
"You think you don't need something, like warming up your vocal cords or drinking that extra glass of water," Cohen said. "But you do."

Texto completo: Coco Cohen is a triathlete. She has competed in Ironman competitions, has a black belt in karate and is a trained sword fighter.
But nothing could quite prepare her for the trials of shouting at top volume all day, several days a week, to her classes at New York City's Columbus Circle Equinox health club, where she is a manager and group fitness instructor. It turns out that shouting repeated encouragements during spin class - "Rise out of the saddle and push!" or "Trust yourself!" - is an occupational hazard.
"I sounded like Kathleen Turner on a downward spiral," said Cohen, who, in a compounding irony, is also a trained professional singer. As her voice grew huskier and the nodes on her vocal cords grew more callused, it took just one cough - the kind you make when water goes down the wrong pipe - for Cohen to get vocal paralysis. She could barely speak above a whisper, if at all, and had the same type of surgery that Julie Andrews had in 1997 after starring in "Victor/Victoria" on Broadway. (Andrews' surgery was botched and left her unable to sing, but Cohen described hers as successful.)
Talk to surgeons and speech language pathologists, and you quickly learn that there's a whole universe of professionals at risk for vocal damage whose job descriptions, technically, do not emphasize the use of their voices at all. Like teachers, for instance. Also lawyers. And a growing number of group fitness instructors like Cohen.
"This is a group that is so mindful of being healthy and taking care of their bodies, but their voices are really neglected," said Leanne Goldberg, director of Grabscheid Voice and Swallowing Center at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.
Comprehensive data on this particular population is limited, but a small body of evidence suggests that fitness instructors are now among those at high risk. In 2016, Christine Estes, a speech language pathologist at the Weill Cornell Medicine Sean Parker Institute for the Voice, noticed that her patients featured a recurring cast of fitness instructors. She decided to conduct a study of them over a two-year period. What she discovered amazed her: They had polyps. They had nodules. They had hemorrhages. Real damage to the vocal cords that needed real treatment. All 24 were referred for behavioral treatment, and 10 opted to have surgery.
Instructors typically average around 15 classes per week, some starting as early as 5 a.m. Many lead several classes back-to-back, with almost no breaks in between. Throughout the day, they're shouting directives - often while demonstrating the moves they're describing - over loud, upbeat music and, in some cases, competing with the noise coming from treadmills, stationary bikes and clanging weights.
Most of all, they're motivating their clients to push themselves, and that motivation generally takes the form of volume. And while most instructors do wear microphones, those devices may not help much if the studio has a low-quality sound system, or if the instructors don't know how to use them to their vocal advantage. A result: Many instructors compromise their vocal health by giving what is a very taxing performance.
Complicating matters even further, the fitness industry has grown more competitive in recent years - in no small part because gym members can rate their instructors online, leaving reviews that someone was "inspiring." As the industry becomes more exacting, so do instructors' appetites to be the very best at their jobs. New instructors "are hungry," Cohen said. "They'll teach class after class, and I've started to warn them: Your voice will be gone."
Patrick Frost, now a Nike Master trainer and the creator of Frostfit, started his fitness career nearly a decade ago at Barry's Bootcamp, a full-body treadmill-and-weights workout studio with locations around the world. He quickly rose through the ranks and, by his account, was teaching close to 22 classes per week.
"Talk to any other instructor," he says. "If you say you teach 22 Barry's Bootcamp classes a week, they'll tell you 'that's insane.' " Which is probably why, about two years into his job, Frost was frantically casting around for last-minute subs and calling in sick.
"Sometimes I'd wake up and not even know if I had a voice," he said. He soon discovered he had major vocal cord polyps, with some hemorrhaging. To conserve his voice, Frost often found himself choosing between his career and his social life. He eventually had surgery in 2015. As part of his recovery, Frost had to be diligent about his at-home exercises, warming up his voice by doing trills and repeating lines he'd say to his classes ("My name is Patrick Frost, Frost like the snowman") at various volumes and pitches.
Stories like Frost's are becoming more common as the industry expands. (According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for trainers is projected to grow 13% by 2028, faster than most occupations.) Take the case of Gerren Liles, for instance. He works not only for Equinox, but also for Mirror, a fitness startup that streams fitness classes right into a person's home (via a special wall-mounted mirror - hence the name). With that, Liles' class load went from 14 per week to 25. Even before joining Mirror, he had vocal problems, and his expanded schedule only exacerbated them. Liles said that when it became "really, really painful," he underwent surgery this past March.
Many fitness instructors work freelance and may not have health insurance that covers treatment for vocal injuries. If they defer treatment, the damage can get worse. Instructors and experts alike say that education about vocal health should be required for new hires.
Some trainers are taking the initiative independently. At Equinox Columbus Circle, for example, Cohen said that she and a colleague organized a few sessions for other instructors focused on vocal health and made some information available to other instructors online.
Practicing good vocal hygiene includes staying hydrated; keeping studio music at lower levels; reducing unnecessary patter; and, when possible, leaving space between classes. Most important, though, it means instructors must develop the same vocal habits as professional singers. Namely, they need to warm up. A few minutes of humming, lip trills or resonance exercises can go a long way. And Estes recommends keeping most headset microphones two finger-widths from the corner of the mouth, but this can vary based on the amplification system.
"You think you don't need something, like warming up your vocal cords or drinking that extra glass of water," Cohen said. "But you do."

Texto completo: Pat Cipollone isn't a household name.
But that could soon change.
The 1984 Covington Catholic graduate's work as the lead attorney of President Donald Trump's defense team has placed him at the center of the impeachment drama.
He may now be a witness in the trial.
As the third impeachment trial in United States' history starts Tuesday, House Democrats issued a letter demanding Cipollone reveal any firsthand knowledge he has related to the two articles of impeachment.
"In light of your extensive knowledge of these key events, your personal representation of President Trump threatens to undermine the integrity of the pending trial," the letter reads. It is signed by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Mass., the lead impeachment manager in the House and six other Democratic members of Congress serving as impeachment managers.
The heart of the issue, according to the Democrats in the letter, is Cipollone's role as a White House attorney and supervisor to John Eisenberg, a deputy counsel to the president for National Security Affairs.
Witnesses testified in the House investigation they brought concerns to Eisenberg shortly after Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
That's the call in whicih the president asked Zelensky to investigate the son of Trump's political rival, Hunter Biden.
The House Democrats in the letter also accuse Cipollone of withholding the whistleblower's complaint from Congress and directing witnesses not to testify.
"Your office was also directly involved in potential efforts to conceal President Trump's scheme from Congress and the public," the letter stated.
Cipollone, 53, spent much of his childhood in the Bronx borough of New York City as the son of a factory worker, according to a New York Times profile. When his father was transferred to Kentucky, Cipollone attended Covington Catholic High School.
He then moved back to New York to attend Fordham University.
He has spent most of his 30-year career in Washington and Chicago.

For red states, a climate disaster by another name In seeking federal funds, officials talk around problem

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is about to distribute billions of dollars to coastal states mainly in the South to help steel them against natural disasters worsened by climate change.
But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.
A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn't use the terms "climate change" or "global warming," nor does South Carolina's proposal. Instead, Texas refers to "changing coastal conditions" and South Carolina talks about the "destabilizing effects and unpredictability" of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.
Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase "climate change" in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.
The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.
The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven't yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.
The money is distributed according to a formula benefitting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.
Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana, $1.2 billion; Florida, $633 million; North Carolina, $168 million; and South Carolina, $158 million, all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.
The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn't yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.
Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding, citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.
Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida's proposal calls it "a key overarching challenge," while North Carolina pledges to anticipate "how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects" will affect state residents.
The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program's goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn't use the terms "climate change" and "global warming" but referred to "changing environmental conditions."
Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their "current and future risks." And when those risks included flooding - the most costly type of disaster nationwide - states were instructed to account for "continued sea level rise," which is one consequence of global warming.
A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.
Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was "a case of picking your battles."
"When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not," Gimont said. "You've got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it's best to draw a middle road on these things."
Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. "Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards," wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control the legislature and the governor's office.

Why Trump's threadbare defense works OP-ED

Texto completo: Let's dispense with one thing off the bat: President Donald Trump's impeachment defense is - in addition to being riddled with false factual claims and misleading characterizations - legal claptrap. It's also likely to work. The essence of the argument, which appears in a 110-page brief submitted Monday by the president's ragtag legal team in advance of his Senate trial, is that Trump can't be impeached for behaviors that are not actual crimes.
"Every prior presidential impeachment in our history has been based on alleged violations of existing law - indeed, criminal law," the brief states. Since House Democrats did not charge the president with committing any specific crimes in abusing his power or obstructing Congress, which are the grounds for the two articles of impeachment that the House of Representatives adopted last month, Trump must skate, the reasoning goes. You can almost hear the lawyers swallowing their pride.
That's because their argument is, in the words of one legal scholar who recently published a book on the history of impeachment, "constitutional nonsense." "High crimes and misdemeanors" - the founders' standard for impeachment - has always been understood to refer to a unique class of offenses, those arising from what Alexander Hamilton called "the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust."
In his authoritative 19th century legal treatise, Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court explained that impeachable acts are by their nature impossible to define in advance. There are many "purely political" offenses that qualify, he wrote, "not one of which is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book."
This view is not remotely controversial. And yet Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who has lately taken to defending Trump against all comers, insists that everyone's got it wrong. That includes, apparently, Dershowitz himself, who argued back in 1998 that "if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime." Now, Dershowitz argues that to be impeachable, a president's behavior must be, if not criminal, at least "crime-like"- an argument that could charitably be described as legal-like.
Perhaps it should come as no surprise that a president who described the Constitution as "like a foreign language" would cling to such a legally preposterous claim. But to be fair to Trump and his lawyers, it's the only one left. The evidence amassed during the House impeachment proceedings - that he shook down a foreign government in the service of his own reelection campaign - is overwhelming, and Trump has yet to counter any of it. He has given himself no option but to say, in effect: "Yeah, I did it. So what?"
This is the Trumpian equivalent of, "It's a free country!" And yet as every grade-school child quickly discovers, that does not mean you can do whatever you want. So why is Trump's argument almost certainly going to work? Because the GOP majority in the Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, knows that its own survival is tied to Trump's, and cares more about its grip on power than its fidelity to constitutional governance.
That's why McConnell is doing all he can to deep-six the impeachment trial with as little fanfare, and as few witnesses, as possible. He knows the "So what?" gambit becomes harder to sustain in the face of testimony from firsthand witnesses to the president's Ukraine scheme - people like John Bolton, the former national security adviser, and Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, both of whom have said they would be willing to testify.
An embarrassingly small clot of GOP senators have said they are open to hearing from these and possibly other key witnesses. Let's hope they stick to their guns. For the rest, Trump's defense brief offers what he might call a perfect solution: He won't make them respond to serious legal arguments if they won't hold him to account for his inexcusable behavior. In this bargain, as with so much else over the past three years, the president and the Senate are made for each other.

Texto completo: Every so often a book comes along that shakes up the national gabfest in a way that makes all of us talk about an old problem with a new urgency.
Jane Jacobs' 1961 book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" sparked a movement to preserve urban neighborhood diversity against developers' bulldozers.
Michael Harrington's 1962 "The Other America: Poverty in the United States" helped spur President Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty."
Rachel Carson's 1962 "Silent Spring" gave flight to what became the environmental preservation movement.
Now 10 years have passed since another breakthrough book shook up the criminal justice debate: legal scholar Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness."
Since hers was hardly the first study to claim racial bias in our nation's criminal justice system, she recalls in an essay that she wrote for the book's 10th anniversary edition, a lot of people told her not to expect much reaction. Instead, the book climbed the New York Times bestseller list, where it remained for nearly 250 weeks.
A decade later, it is easier to look back and see what made this book stand out - and ignite another debate, even as states such as Illinois expunge thousands of minor drug convictions. With ample statistics and historical narratives, she gave voice to what many people had long suspected: the surge in black incarceration that followed decades of the war on drugs had become, whether by accident or design, a "new Jim Crow."
The nation's criminal justice system uses the war on drugs to enforce forms of racial discrimination, oppression and "social control" that most of us thought had gone away with the hard-won victories of the civil rights era.
For this, she has received some scholarly pushback. In his book "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform," John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor, argues that Alexander makes too much of the statistics for drug offenders, since they make up only a small part of the prison population - and nonviolent drug offenders an even smaller part.
Although the proportion of state prisoners whose primary crime was a drug offense rose sharply from 1980 to 1990, when it peaked at 22%, Pfaff writes, that leaves about four-fifths who were found guilty of some other offense.
By 2010, it fell to 17%. Bottom line, says the statistics expert: Reducing the incarceration of drug offenders will not do much to reduce prison populations.
Other scholars have made similar claims. Jonathan Rothwell, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, tries nobly to reconcile the differences by comparing the time and length of sentences for different crimes. Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades, but those offenders tend to serve shorter sentences.
"Rolling back the war on drugs would not totally solve the problem of mass incarceration," he writes, "but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison."
The get-tough approach to crime is much less popular now. That helps to explain why former Vice President Joe Biden seemed to be caught in a time warp as he tried to defend his support of the get-tough 1994 crime law that Alexander blames for making the mass incarceration problem worse.
But that bill was supported by a lot of black folks, including the Congressional Black Caucus, although they also called for other reforms.
But today, more people of all races are asking questions about the role race plays in our justice system. Crack cocaine, primarily a plague in black communities, was treated as a crime problem. Opioid abuse, more closely identified with poor white communities, has been treated as a public health problem.
Racial disparities like that are not easily brushed off as coincidence. Nor should they be. Instead, they help to explain the enduring popularity of Alexander's book.

Texto completo: Once again, Oprah Winfrey is here to remind everyone that her exit from a Sundance documentary featuring Russell Simmons' accusers had nothing to do with pressure she received from the music mogul.
Appearing on Tuesday's "CBS This Morning," Winfrey addressed the media storm surrounding her decision to remove herself as executive producer of "On the Record," a film by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering centering on multiple women who have accused Simmons of sexual misconduct. In keeping with her statements so far, the OWN mastermind doubled down on the move, reiterating concerns that the documentary was not ready to premiere at this weekend's Sundance Film Festival.
"In all experiences of my life, and particularly when I'm in a crisis, the only question for me is, 'What is the right thing to do ... for me?' " Winfrey told the CBS hosts.
"Before the public pressure had started, before Russell had gone with his Instagram, I had gone to the filmmakers, and I had said to them, 'Houston, I think we have a problem here,' ... I said, 'I think we need to pull out of Sundance, and if we can't pull out of Sundance, I'm going to have to take my name off. I don't want to have to take my name off because it's going to be a big hullabaloo.' "
A "big hullabaloo" indeed. Winfrey made headlines when she left the documentary in early January, about a month after her involvement was announced as part of her producing deal with Apple TV+ - where the project was originally set to land before the veteran TV host jumped ship.
Winfrey also dismissed claims that she failed black women by allowing herself to be "intimidated" by Simmons, calling the idea "ridiculous." When reminded that some have perceived her retreat as a win for Simmons - who has publicly and privately expressed his disappointment with her involvement - she fired back.
"This is not a victory for Russell, and I unequivocally say that I did not pull out because of Russell," she said. "This is not a victory lap for him. I cannot be silenced by a Russell Simmons after all I've been through ... I stand with the women. I support the women. And I do hope people will see the film."
Simmons has denied all allegations, saying in a November 2017 statement to The Times, "Let me be crystal clear and very direct. Abusing women in any way shape or form violates the very core of my being."
Shortly after Winfrey announced her departure, the Los Angeles Times sat down with Dick and Ziering, who recounted the damaging aftermath of the alleged blindside and recalled their cordial interactions with Winfrey's team leading up to it.
"She loved, loved, loved what we did," Ziering said. "And then she saw it numerous times throughout the editing process. We had a very close working relationship and very, very positive - enthusiastically positive. There weren't any issues."
As in her original public statement, Winfrey insisted on "CBS This Morning" that she fully believes and supports Simmons' accusers, especially considering her own #MeToo experiences at a young age. However, she thought the film could benefit from more context and accuser interviews, as well as tackling certain "inconsistencies" that had been brought to her attention.
In a piece published last week in the New York Times, Winfrey explained that people in her circle had challenged the account of one of Simmons' most vocal rape accusers, Drew Dixon, but did not elaborate on the specific concerns in question.
"I don't care about awards. I just care about getting it right," Winfrey said Tuesday on CBS. "I believe that the women's voices deserve to be heard, and as an executive producer, I also was in a position where I thought some things were not right. ... I've always been in the position, as an executive producer, if I say, 'I want changes,' usually those are done. So what this has taught me is, don't put your name on anything that you don't have creative control over."
"On the Record" is still set to debut Saturday at Sundance, where the filmmakers will be on the lookout for a new distributor.
"We wish we were going with Apple and Ms. Winfrey. I mean, we do. But it's bigger than those two, really," Dick told The Times last week. "We feel the film is completely solid, addresses everything very powerfully. We know that it does because the responses of hundreds of people from all walks of life have been so glowing and enthusiastic.
"We stand by the film, we stand by the survivors' stories completely, we know that the veracity is completely locked down. We think the film is strong and we are very hopeful that audiences at Sundance will feel the same."

For red states, a climate disaster by another name In seeking federal funds, officials talk around problem

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Trump administration is about to distribute billions of dollars to coastal states mainly in the South to help steel them against natural disasters worsened by climate change.
But states that qualify must first explain why they need the money. That has triggered linguistic acrobatics as some conservative states submit lengthy, detailed proposals on how they will use the money, while mostly not mentioning climate change.
A 306-page draft proposal from Texas doesn't use the terms "climate change" or "global warming," nor does South Carolina's proposal. Instead, Texas refers to "changing coastal conditions" and South Carolina talks about the "destabilizing effects and unpredictability" of being hit by three major storms in four years, while being barely missed by three other hurricanes.
Louisiana, a state taking some of the most aggressive steps in the nation to prepare for climate change, does include the phrase "climate change" in its proposal in one place, an appendix on the final page.
The federal funding program, devised after the devastating hurricanes and wildfires of 2017, reflects the complicated politics of global warming in the United States, even as the toll of that warming has become difficult to ignore. While officials from both political parties are increasingly forced to confront the effects of climate change, including worsening floods, more powerful storms and greater economic damage, many remain reluctant to talk about the cause.
The $16 billion program, created by Congress and overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is meant to help states better prepare for future natural disasters. It is the first time such funds have been used to prepare for disasters like these that haven't yet happened, rather than responding to or repairing damage that has already occurred.
The money is distributed according to a formula benefitting states most affected by disasters in 2015, 2016 and 2017. That formula favors Republican-leaning states along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, which were hit particularly hard during that period.
Texas is in line for more than $4 billion, the most of any state. The next largest sums go to Louisiana, $1.2 billion; Florida, $633 million; North Carolina, $168 million; and South Carolina, $158 million, all of which voted Republican in the 2016 presidential election.
The other states getting funding are West Virginia, Missouri, Georgia and California, the only state getting money that voted Democratic in the presidential race of 2016. California hasn't yet submitted its proposal, but in the past the state has spoken forcefully about the threat of climate change, in addition to fighting with the Trump administration to limit greenhouse gas emissions from cars.
Half the money, $8.3 billion, was set aside for Puerto Rico, as well as $774 million for the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Trump administration has delayed that funding, citing concerns over corruption and fiscal management.
Not every state has felt compelled to tiptoe around climate change. Florida's proposal calls it "a key overarching challenge," while North Carolina pledges to anticipate "how a changing climate, extreme events, ecological degradation and their cascading effects" will affect state residents.
The housing department has itself been careful about how it described the program's goals. When HUD in August released the rules governing the money, it didn't use the terms "climate change" and "global warming" but referred to "changing environmental conditions."
Still, the rule required states that received money to describe their "current and future risks." And when those risks included flooding - the most costly type of disaster nationwide - states were instructed to account for "continued sea level rise," which is one consequence of global warming.
A spokeswoman for the housing department did not respond to requests for comment.
Stan Gimont, who as deputy assistant secretary for grant programs at HUD was responsible for the program until he left the department last summer, said the decision not to cite climate change was "a case of picking your battles."
"When you go out and talk to local officials, there are some who will very actively discuss climate change and sea-level rise, and then there are those who will not," Gimont said. "You've got to work with both ends of the spectrum. And I think in a lot of ways it's best to draw a middle road on these things."
Other states used their proposals to emphasize the centrality of climate change to the risks they face. "Climate change is a key overarching challenge which threatens to compound the extent and effects of hazards," wrote officials in Florida, where Republicans control the legislature and the governor's office.

UConn great Moore to sit out 2nd straight WNBA season women's basketball

Texto completo: Former UConn great and four-time WNBA champion Maya Moore will sit out another WNBA season as she continues her work in the criminal justice reform space and in fighting for the release of Jonathan Irons, a family friend she believes was wrongly convicted, the New York Times reported Wednesday.
Moore, a two-time Olympian, also ruled out competing in this summer's Olympics in Tokyo.
"I'm in a really good place right now with my life, and I don't want to change anything," Moore told the Times. "Basketball has not been foremost in my mind. I've been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I've been able to be there for Jonathan."
Moore shocked the basketball world last February when, at 29 years old, she announced that she would sit out the WNBA season to help Irons appeal his conviction. He is currently serving a 50-year sentence for burglary and assaulting a homeowner with a gun.
During her year away from the sport, Moore spent time ministering in her home town of Atlanta, consulting with Irons and his defense team, and attending hearings regarding Irons' appeal.
The Minnesota Lynx forward, the No. 1 pick of the 2011 WNBA Draft, told the Times that she didn't "feel like this is the right time for me to retire" but that "there is nothing more I wish I could experience" in her career.
UConn named Moore as a confirmed attendee for Monday's exhibition game against the U.S. national team, where the school will honor the 2009 and 2010 national-title winning teams, both of which Moore was a part of, prior to tip off.

Texto completo: "The tribes of Europe, the peoples of almost every country of the Old Continent, are visibly aging, shrinking and dying. The population crisis of Europe is "existential."
Andrej Plenkovic, Croatian Prime Minister
If Western elites were asked to name the greatest crisis facing mankind, climate change would win in a walk.
Thus did Time magazine pass over every world leader to name a Swedish teenage climate activist, Greta Thunberg, its person of the year.
On New Year's Day, the headline over yet another story in The Washington Post admonished us anew: "A Lost Decade for Climate Action: We Can't Afford A Repeat, Scientists Warn."
"By the final year of the decade," said the Post, "the planet had surpassed its 2010 temperature record five times. "Hurricanes devastated New Jersey and Puerto Rico, and floods damaged the Midwest and Bangladesh. Southern Africa was gripped by a deadly drought. Australia and the Amazon are ablaze."
On it went, echoing the endless reports on the perils of climate change to the planet we all inhabit.
Yet, from the inaction of the carbon-emitting countries like India, China, Russia and the U.S., the gravity with which Western elites view the crisis is not shared by the peoples for whom they profess to speak. For many First World countries, there are more compelling concerns. High among them is population decline, and, if birth rates do not rise, the near-extinction of many Western peoples by this century's end.
The number of births in Japan fell in 2019 to a level unseen since 1874, around 900,000. But there were 1.4 million deaths for a net loss of 512,000 Japanese. An even larger loss in Japan's population is expected this year. Japan's population has been shrinking since 2007, when deaths first exceeded births by 18,000. And with 28% of its population over 65, and fewer births every passing year, Japan is aging, shrinking and dying — with no respite in sight.
Across Japan, writes The New York Times: "Whole villages are vanishing as young people choose not to have children or move to urban areas ... The Government estimates that the population could shrink by about 16 million people -- or nearly 13 percent -- over the next 25 years."
South Korea has an even lower birth rate, and its population is expected to start diminishing this year.
But it is Eastern Europe where the population crisis is most advanced. At the end of the Cold War, Bulgaria had 9 million people. By 2017, that had fallen to 7.1 million. In 2050, Bulgaria's population is estimated at 5.4 million — a loss of 40% to death and migration since Bulgaria won its freedom from the Soviet Empire.
By 2050, Ukraine and Poland are each projected to lose another 6 million people, and Hungary will lose 1.5 million.
Lithuania and Latvia have seen serious population losses since the end of the Cold War and are in the front rank of European nations losing people at the fastest rate. U.N. demographers project Russia's population may fall from 145 million today to 121 million by 2050. Such losses rival those that Russia suffered under Lenin, Stalin and World War II.
The Far East is home to some 6 million Russians who dwell on that vast tract that is so full of natural resources like timber, oil and gas. "The population continues to decrease almost everywhere in the Far East," lamented President Vladimir Putin at an investment conference in Vladivostok: "The inflow is increasing, but it does not cover the number of people leaving the region." In the Far East, Siberia and the Lake Baikal region, investors and workers from China are appearing in growing numbers.
The tribes of Europe, the peoples of almost every country of the Old Continent, are visibly aging, shrinking and dying. The population crisis of Europe is "existential," says Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic.
Since I published "The Death of the West," nothing has happened to alter my conclusion as to where the West was destined:
"The Death of the West" is not a prediction of what is going to happen. It is a depiction of what is happening now. First World nations are dying. They face a mortal crisis, not because of something happening in the Third World, but because of what is not happening at home and in the homes of the First World. Western fertility rates have been falling for decades. Outside of Muslim Albania, no European nation is producing enough babies to replace its population. ... In a score of countries the old are already dying off faster than the young are being born. ... There is no sign of a turnaround. Now the absolute numbers of Europeans have begun to fall."
We are talking here about what historians, a century hence, will call the Lost Tribes of Europe. And if a people has ceased to replace itself, and the national family is dying out, it is difficult to generate alarm over the slow sinking of the Maldives into the sea, the melting of the polar ice caps, or the fact that Greenland is getting greener every year.

Texto completo: My life overfloweth with books. This is no surprise to you if you're a book lover. My newest coffee mug says, "I have no shelf control."
I tried to lay them all on the floor at the end of the year to see which ones sparked joy, as suggested by an international organizational guru. I wound up sitting on the floor in the middle of stacks of books reading through them, seeing passages I had marked or inscriptions such as the one "From Mom to My Best Girl" in a volume of Rod McKuen poems in 1976. Little did I know it would be the last Christmas my mother would be alive.
Talk about sentimental.
Ninety percent of my books spark joy. The other ten percent have been loved at one time and are happily recycled to other readers. I've even started my own "little tree library," out in a grove of trees at our house. So, that's a trend for me this year–embracing my shelves of books despite feeling like I'm supposed to be decluttering.
Walking into someone's home and seeing the kinds of books that line their shelves tells us more about who they are than days of conversation, don't you think? Is a guest going to pick up my Kindle and flip through it? That would feel weird.
My prediction: Paper books aren't going away no matter how sparse people want their houses to look or how smart their phones are.
Two celebrity book clubs to watch
Remember when Oprah's book club debuted and changed reading habits for almost everyone? During the past couple of years actor Reese Witherspoon has changed the book world—and certainly the lives of authors–with picks for her Hello Sunshine book club. Each month she chooses a book she loves with a woman at the center of the story—and she has developed an entire media company around this with many of the picks headed for films. Start noticing the bright yellow "Reese's Book Club" stickers on books.
I keep an eye out for her picks and have read several of them, including my first novel of 2020, "Daisy Jones and The Six" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, about an up-and-coming rock band in the 1970s that suddenly breaks up. This book is told in an interesting interview style, which took me a while to get into, but I was glad I stuck with it.
This month's pick is "Such A Fun Age" by Kiley Reid, about a young women wrongfully accused of kidnapping a child. As Witherspoon says on her book club website, "If one of your New Year's resolutions is to read more books, I have a great one for you... This story is a beautiful conversation starter about race, privilege, work dynamics...I can't wait to hear your thoughts!"
For a list of other picks and lots of book news: https://hello-sunshine.com/book-club.
Another celebrity book club that has taken off with a bang is the Read with Jenna book club on NBC's Today Show, with books chosen by Jenna Bush Hager, broadcaster and daughter of former president George W. Bush. The club started in March 2019 and she "looks for stories that will delight, entertain and challenge readers."
Her January pick is "Dear Edward" by Ann Napolitano, about a 12-year-old boy named Edward, the sole survivor of a plane crash that claims the lives of 183 passengers, including his family. After the heartbreaking ordeal, he has to find the resilience to create a new life for himself with his aunt and uncle.
Evvie Drake Starts Over on the list
One of my favorite books of last year, "Evvie Drake Starts Over," was also one of the Read with Jenna choices. The debut novel by Linda Holmes, host of NPR's "Pop Culture Happy Hour" podcast, follows Evvie a year after the death of her husband and includes a goodly number of secrets and her surprise relationship with a failed major league baseball player. (As a baseball fan, I loved this pitcher with the "yips.")
Keep an eye on Barnes & Noble with new ownership
I give thanks that Shreveport-Bossier still has Barnes & Noble Booksellers. Every year that the store hangs on in the world of online book sales is a victory for local book lovers. Sold last year to an investment group that owns Waterstones, one of the largest booksellers in the United Kingdom, the Barnes & Noble chain now shares CEO James Daunt with Waterstones.
Daunt is known for his innovations in UK stores, include giving local stores more control and allowing individual personality. Some of the strategies that have worked for Waterstones are being tried at the approximately 600 Barnes & Noble stores in the United States. Among these ideas: the selection of a book of the year chosen from nominations from stores across the country.
Books to consider in the new year
The Barnes & Noble book of 2019 was "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse," which surprised and intrigued me enough that I plan to buy a copy. It's an illustrated story by Charlie Mackesy, a UK based artist, a book that sprang from an Instagram drawing.
That drawing eventually grew into "The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse," a story in which a young boy and three animals wander through the English countryside, talking of the importance of life, love, acceptance—and cake.
"This is the book more than any other that has caught the eye of our booksellers," Daunt said. "Word of mouth amongst our booksellers has made this inspirational book the surprise bestseller of the year."
The chain's other book of the year finalists were: "The Testaments" by Margaret Atwood; "The Food of Sichuan" by Fuchsia Dunlop; "Mythos" by Stephen Fry; "The Silent Patient" by Alex Michaelides; "Olive, Again" by Elizabeth Strout; "No One is Too Small to Make a Difference" by Greta Thunberg and "The Nickel Boys" by Colson Whitehead.
Lisa Wingate new novel to release in April
Get ready for another big novel from bestselling author Lisa Wingate, whose "Book of Lost Friends" releases April 7 and is already getting buzz in the publishing industry. Wingate, a friend, wrote "Before We Were Yours," which has sold nearly 2.5 Million copies and was No. 1 on the New York Times paperback bestseller list again last week. We co-authored its nonfiction sequel, "Before And After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society."
"Book of Lost Friends" is set mostly in Louisiana and was inspired by a little-known piece of history. It's a dramatic story of three young women on a journey in search of family amidst the destruction of the post-Civil War South, and it is also the tale of a modern-day teacher who rediscovers the old story and its vital connection to her own students' lives.
Wingate brings to life stories from actual "Lost Friends" advertisements that appeared in the Southwestern Christian Advocate, a widely distributed newspaper for the African American community in the South. She has a knack for ferreting out fascinating and important pieces of history, researching them intensely and bringing them to life again. I've read an early copy of "Book of Lost Friends" and love the characters and this part of Louisiana history I'd never heard about.
NPR Book Concierge recommends scads of great books
One of my discoveries at the end of last year was a listing of all sorts of great books recommended by National Public Radio. If you've been hankering for new reading ideas, organized by category, by all means take a look at this site: https://apps.npr.org/best-books/#view=covers&year=2019.
Book columnist Judy Christie is the author of 18 books, including 10 novels and the nonfiction sequel to "Before We Were Yours"— "Before and After: The Incredible Real-Life Stories of Orphans Who Survived the Tennessee Children's Home Society," published by Penguin Random House.

Hindenberg disaster was off-limits topic for some

Texto completo: A couple months ago the New York Times reported on the death of Werner C Doehner, 90, of Laconia, New Hampshire. He was the last survivor of the Hindenburg disaster where three dozen people were killed. Not many people have heard of Werner C. Doehner, which is typical of the 1930s when people did not talk about tragedies in their lives. Post Traumatic Stress did not exist; people got on with their lives. Counselors and mental health experts were not available.
Eight-year-old Werner Doehner was aboard the Hindenburg for the three day Atlantic crossing. Along with his parents, Hermann and Matilde Doehner, he was joined by his brother and sister. The airship exploded in flames just over Lakehurst Naval Air Station at 7:30pm on May 6, 1937. Thirty-three people, including Werner Doehner's father and sister were killed.
"My dad was secretive about the disaster and didn't like to talk about it," son Bernie said. The zeppelin had made 62flights before the fatal one. Werner Doehner was the last survivor to be thrown from the zeppelin when his mother threw him and his brother from a cabin window. The three of them suffered burns and were in the hospital for a few months before being able to return to their home in Mexico. His father died at the scene and his sister died later at a hospital.
It is remarkable how lives can cross. Seventeen-year-old Bob Buchanan from Toms River had been hired as part of the ground crew to grab a rope as the Hindenburg came down. He tried to hold on when the zeppelin caught fire, getting mild burns in his attempt to secure the lines, but backed away as most of the ground crew did. It was an experience he didn't often talk about unless he was asked to give a presentation to groups in the area. Even then he talked about the tragedy, not his participation in trying to save people or the doomed Hindenburg.
Did Buchanan ever see victims and survivors dropping from the Hinderburg? Lying burned on the ground? Was he ever given the Doehners' names? Did he try to give aid or pull the survivors away from the fire? We will never know the answers to these questions unless records are kept somewhere. Bob Buchanan and Werner Doehner never talked specifics or names. Obviously, it was an extremely hard time for both of them. The stiff upper lip philosophy carried throughout both their lives.
Many photos of the Hindenburg flying over Long Beach Island or up and down the coast are in museums. Most are from previous trips, not the fatal one. People were enjoying themselves on New Jersey beaches; and many had their Brownie box cameras on them. How easy it was to grab cameras and point directly up into the sky as the Hinderburg passed overhead. Cameras have come a long way since Brownie box cameras were thought to be the latest gadget around; but they recorded many significant happenings. (One is the toppling of the Tucker's Island Lighthouse when previous/fired lighthouse keeper Arthur Rider's great nephew had his with him when the lighthouse fell into the sea).
Buchanan came from a family of sailors. H sailed boats all his life, and was an excellent sailor, becoming the winning skipper on Dr. John Crozier's A Cat Merry Thought at the Toms River Seaport's Old Boat Regatta in 1981. Today Merry Thought is sitting in the Herreshoff Museum, Bristol, Rhode Island. Halsey Herreshoff is hoping someone from the greater Barnegat Bay region will sponsor her restoration.
The Hindenburg was a gigantic zeppelin: 800 feet long by 135 feet in diameter. Rick Zitarosa, historian and vice president of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, describes the Hindenburg as a "huge flying billboard for German aeronautical supremacy billboard. It was a great flying machine bearing 50 foot Swastikas on its tail."
When the Hindenberg exploded and crashed to the ground, it only had 36 passengers aboard. Only wealthy people could afford such luxury travel. The Doehners were able to afford the fare for all their family from Frankfurt, Germany, to New Jersey. Bad weather had delayed the landing. The zeppelin was due to leave again that evening heading to Europe for the coronation of King George VI of England. Seventy-two people had booked the flight.
Thirteen passengers, 22 crew members and one person on the ground were killed. Werner Doehner's once took his son to Lakehurst to see the scene of the family tragedy. Bernie Doehner remembers that his electrical engineer father did not say much, nor was there much to see at the time. Werner Doehner worked in Mexico City and Equator over the years, before coming to the United States to work for General Electric. He retired to Parachute, Colorado, and later to Laconia, New Hampshire, with his wife during the last year of his life.
Wehner Doehner died on Nov. 8 at the age of 90 in Laconia.
The New Jersey Maritime Museum, 528 Dock Road, Beach Haven, has a request: if you have any family prints or home movie of the Hindenburg, will you bring them to the museum and share your stories? The Hindenburg still draws many people to the museum, where they ask about the display on zeppelins and the role they may or may not have played in Nazi espionage. Opinions and books differ on this subject.
The NJMM is open weekends, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sightseeing on LBI is perfect with no lights, some restaurants still open, magnificent sunsets and a chance to see the amount of construction going on. The museum is looking for a volunteer grant writer and someone who can scan old photos. Hours are on your own time schedule. For more information call 609-492-0202.

Texto completo: The company behind the hit true-crime podcast "Serial" is exploring a sale, according to a person familiar with the matter, putting one of digital audio's biggest brands on the market as the medium becomes increasingly popular.
Serial Productions is best known for producing "Serial," a podcast that offers a new multipart series every season. Its first season garnered more than 300 million downloads.
Among the potential buyers for Serial Productions is New York Times Co., the person said. A deal could accelerate the growth of the Times's audio division. The revenue and potential valuation of Serial Productions wasn't clear, but any transaction would likely be small for the Times or another major media company.
Representatives of Serial Productions didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the New York Times declined to comment.
Several media companies have looked to bulk up on podcasting as it has exploded in popularity. Audiostreaming company Spotify Technology SA last year purchased narrative-audio company Gimlet Media for more than $200 million and is in early talks to buy sports and pop-culture company The Ringer, which produces more than 30 podcasts, The Wall Street Journal reported last week. Radio company iHeartMedia Inc. purchased Stuff Media for about $55 million in 2018.
U.S. podcast advertising revenue totaled $678 million in 2019, according to projections from research firm eMarketer, a fraction of the $129.34 billion spent on digital ads.
But the sector is expanding quickly and has more than doubled in revenue since 2017, according to data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Serial Productions was launched in 2017 by Sarah Koenig, Julie Snyder and Ira Glass, colleagues at "This American Life." The company is co-owned by its founders. Ms. Koenig hosts and is an executive producer of "Serial," which made its debut in 2014 as a spinoff of "This American Life."
"Serial" is widely credited with helping to popularize the podcasting format. The success of the first season, which explored the murder conviction of Baltimore County, Md., teenager Adnan Syed, inspired other true-crime shows. The other seasons, which began in 2015 and 2018, were about the desertion of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and the Cleveland criminal-justice system, respectively.

Texto completo: The hour of 1 p.m., the designated time for the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, came and went. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was in the Capitol, cooling his heels. But the Senate remained in recess.
Half an hour later, we found out why: Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky, and his Senate Republicans had been rewriting the trial rules on the fly, minutes before bringing them to a vote. They are quite literally making things up as they go along.
Public pressure on moderate Republican senators had, for the moment, forced McConnell to soften a couple of the most egregious trial rules -- notably, a plan that would have forced the case to be argued in the middle of the night - but it did nothing to slow McConnell's pell-mell rush to acquit. McConnell, who during a break in proceedings Tuesday huddled with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, succeeded in rebuffing, along party lines, efforts to call witnesses and demand documents that Trump withheld.
Why such a hurry? The answer became apparent as soon as Trump's lawyers opened their mouths for the first time during the impeachment proceedings.
They shouted. They launched personal attacks against the impeachment managers. But they offered virtually nothing in defense of the president's conduct, nor anything but a passing reference to Ukraine.
"These Articles of Impeachment ... are not only ridiculous, they are dangerous to our republic," declared Cipollone.
"It's ridiculous," he added.
"It's ridiculous! It's ridiculous," he repeated, for those who may have missed the point.
Cipollone closed with a request to "end this ridiculous charade."
But he didn't rest his case there. He and his colleagues built on this playground-worthy argument: "Outrageous!" "No crime!" "A complete fake!"
Here were the president's men, in the flesh, occupying a factual universe all their own. "The president was not allowed to have a lawyer present" in House proceedings, said the presidential lawyers who refused to be present in House proceedings.
The impeachment managers have "evidence ... that we haven't been allowed to see," said the White House officials who blocked the release of all documents.
Day One offered the starkest of contrasts: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his impeachment managers framing their case in somber terms and painstaking detail - and the other side responding with what amounted to an extended reading of Trump's tweets.
Most of the 53 Senate Republicans are lawyers, so they had to be aware that what they were getting from the White House did not amount to a defense. Their body language suggested they wanted the whole thing to end -quickly. Patrick Toomey (Pa.) chewed his reading glasses. Marco Rubio (Fla.) chewed at a fingernail. John Hoeven (N.D.) yawned. So did Lindsey Graham (S.C.).
The White House's case is unlikely to improve from here. Also appearing for Trump will be Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz, lately members of Jeffrey Epstein's defense team. Dershowitz has already distanced himself from the brief the White House filed. And the New York Times reported that one of the lawyers cited in Trump's brief has called the White House argument "constitutional nonsense."
Republicans find themselves defying public opinion in their attempts to avoid testimony. A CNN poll found that 69 percent of Americans say witnesses should testify in the trial, including 48 percent of Republicans. Trump himself said in December that he wants White House officials "to testify in the Senate where they'll get a fair trial."
But Trump is now trying so hard to avoid witnesses that the White House is working on backup plans to silence them. Tuesday's arguments made clear why: The White House has no substantive defense.
Rather, it has grievances.
Cipollone returned to the lectern with yet another complaint. The House's case, he declared, "is too much to listen to, almost." But he didn't attempt a refutation.
No wonder McConnell can't be done with this trial fast enough.

Texto completo: Stacey Abrams, the Georgia state legislator who became the first black woman in U.S. history to win a major party gubernatorial nomination, warned a Maine audience Wednesday that officials across the country are using voter suppression to change election results and undermine democracy.
"Voter suppression isn't guns and hoses and bully clubs and Bull Connor," Abrams said, referring to the Birmingham, Alabama, police commissioner who enforced racist policies in the 1960s.
"It's administrative burdens that interfere with your right to vote. In the south they try to stop you from getting on the rolls ... and to stay on the rolls ... and have your ballot be counted.
"We need our democracy to work, we need poverty to end, we need disenfranchisement to be a thing of the past, because when people are suppressed or oppressed it rages. It may be silent for some time but eventually it will come out."
Abrams spoke at an event honoring Martin Luther King Jr. at the University of New England's Portland campus attended by a standing-room-only audience of nearly 900 that included Gov. Janet Mills, whom Abrams called a "dear friend."
Abrams, a Democrat, lost the 2018 Georgia governor's race to the just-resigned Secretary of State, Brian Kemp, in a contest she has described as illegitimate. As secretary of state, Kemp had overseen the implementation of some of the country's strictest voting laws and a purge of 670,000 voter registrations in 2017. His margin of victory was under 55,000 votes, leading Abrams to declare the result tainted.
"I legally acknowledge that Brian Kemp secured a sufficient number of votes under our existing system to become the governor of Georgia," Abrams told the New York Times Magazine last year. "I do not concede that the process was proper, nor do I condone that process."
In Portland, she described how Georgia and other state governments use a variety of methods to suppress the votes of people they think will vote for the opposition party, especially African-Americans, other minorities and students. Selective polling station closures, subjective screening of whether signatures match from one document to another, and purges of voter rolls, she said, are used to subvert the democratic process.
She said she had chosen not to run for president this year because there were plenty of good candidates and because fighting voter suppression was a better and more consequential use of her time. One of the organizations she founded, Fair Count, seeks to make sure there is a full count of minorities, immigrants and other traditionally undercounted groups.
"The census is the allocation of power in America. It allocates $1.3 trillion a year," she noted Wednesday, and urged fellow progressives to take a greater interest in its success.
She said she chose not to run for U.S. Senate in Georgia because "I do not want the job. ... I prefer the executive branch, because you have the most direct contact with change and have the ability to achieve the change you want to see."
Abrams, a lawyer and successful romance novelist, is considered a rising star in the Democratic Party for running competitively in a Deep Southern state. In February 2019, she became first African-American woman to deliver an official response to a presidential State of the Union address.
Born to a Mississippi college librarian and a dyslexic shipyard worker who participated in the civil rights movement and later became Methodist ministers, Abrams was largely raised in Atlanta, where she would serve as deputy city attorney. A graduate of Yale Law School, she published eight romance novels under the alias Selma Montgomery before entering state politics and rising to become House minority leader in the Georgia Legislature.
After the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Abrams founded the New Georgia Project, a nonprofit that sought to counteract the effects of voter roll purges and other voter disenfranchisement polices in the state by registering minorities, women and young people.
Her eventual gubernatorial rival, Kemp, in 2017 oversaw the cancellation of 100,000 registrations of voters who hadn't voted in recent elections, according to a study by American Public Media, and set aside 53,000 others for review under an "exact match" policy that required information on registration applications precisely match those on other official records, including hyphenations and spacing between last names, which the state department of motor vehicles didn't allow. Seventy percent of these voters were African American.
"It was like the New England Patriots let Tom Brady be the referee," Abrams told the Portland audience, speaking of the conflict of interest Kemp had in overseeing a election he was participating in.
Critics of the management of the 2018 gubernatorial election, including some of the Democratic presidential candidates, have said voter suppression cost Abrams the election. Kemp has dismissed the criticism as Democrats "playing politics."
Abrams's appearance was part of UNE's annual MLK Jr. Celebration, held in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King's May 1964 visit to St. Francis College, UNE's Biddeford precursor, in his only visit to Maine. "For people on campus at that time his visit represented a really special moment," UNE president James Herbert told the audience Wednesday.

SUPREME COURT CONSERVATIVES SEEM OPEN TO STATE AID FOR RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court's conservative justices were seen as inclined to endorse a Montana program that provided tax incentives to those who fund scholarships for families to use at religious schools.
While liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned at Wednesday's oral argument that it would be a "radical" departure for the court, her ideological counterparts said excluding religious institutions from government programs open to others could amount to unconstitutional discrimination similar to racial bias.
The outcome and breadth of the decision seem to depend on Chief Justice John Roberts, who generally has been part of the court's modern movement to loosen the rules regarding church and state separations. He usually prefers the court to move in incremental ways.
Justice Roberts, 64, was looking none the worse for wear while taking the bench less than eight hours after presiding over a marathon session of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. He made no mention of his double duties, but the court acknowledged it scheduled only one oral argument Wednesday in anticipation of his Senate service.
The importance of the case was underscored by the number of people who camped out in freezing temperatures on the Supreme Court's sidewalk to get inside. The lucky ones joined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has made including religious schools in school choice programs a priority and who sat in the front row.
At issue was an initiative passed by the Montana legislature in 2015 that provided dollar-for-dollar tax credits up to $150 to those who donated to scholarship programs for low-income parents to send their children to private schools.
The program made no distinction as to whether parents could use the scholarships at religious or secular schools. About 70% of private schools in the state are religious.
The Montana Supreme Court said that ran counter to a state constitutional prohibition against using public funds for religious institutions and schools. Instead of saying the program could fund only secular schools, it struck down the tax credit program.
"The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools," said Richard Komer, who was representing the parents on behalf of the libertarian Institute for Justice. He said that ruling singled out religious parents and violated the U.S. Constitution's protection of the free exercise of religion.
But liberal justices defended the Montana Supreme Court's action to level down (getting rid of the program) rather than level up (making it available for use at all schools).
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the parents even had standing to bring the case, because they were being treated no differently from parents who sent their children to secular private schools.
"Where is the harm?" she asked.
Justice Elena Kagan picked up on that. "Because of the [Montana] Supreme Court's ruling, whether you go to a religious school or you go to a secular private school, you're in the same boat at this point," she said, adding, "There is no discrimination at this point going on, is there?"
Justice Sotomayor wondered about the extent of Mr. Komer's argument. "Are you saying that states are forced to give money both to secular and religious schools?" she asked.
Mr. Komer noted the money was given to parents who made the choice of school. But he added, "If they give to one [family], they must give to the other." He said the Montana court's remedy of striking the entire program did not shield it from charges of discriminating against parents who favored religious schools.
The high court in 2017 said Missouri could not ban a church school from requesting a grant from a state program that rehabilitated playgrounds. Justice Kagan and fellow liberal Justice Stephen Breyer joined that decision but indicated Wednesday that religious education was different.
Justice Breyer noted the Constitution's prohibition on government establishment of religion. "There is nothing more religious, except perhaps for the service in the church itself, than religious education," Justice Breyer said. "That's how we create a future for our religion."
Justice Breyer was reacting in part to the argument of Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall; the Trump administration is supporting the parents.

HYPOCRISY RUNS AMOK IN BASEBALL HALL BALLOTING

Texto completo: Integrity, my Astro.
This will be the last time I write about Baseball's Hall of Farce, about how sports writers invoke the "integrity" clause - reportedly written into the ballot by a segregationist - in order to keep two of the greatest players of all time locked out of a museum that already includes, as the New York Times' Bill Pennington put it, "multiple virulent racists, drunks, cheats, brawlers, drug users and at least one acknowledged sex addict."
If the idea is to keep the bad guys out, it's a little late.
Cheating is as rampant as it ever was, as rampant as it always will be, whether it's the 1951 New York Giants using an elaborate sign-stealing system, or the 2017 Houston Asterisks doing the same. Whether it's players pumping amphetamines or anabolic steroids - or who knows what these days?- to gain an edge.
But you go, sports writers. Cast aside Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens while Bumblin' Bud Selig, who kept one eye closed and both ears covered as artificially jacked-up sluggers saved his sport, slides in (thanks to a vote that included current Hall of Famers, executives and media members).
This much is clear: Bonds and Clemens missed the cut again Tuesday and have no momentum toward gaining the necessary 75% of the vote.
Harold Baines is in. Barry Bonds is out.
ESPN's David Schoenfield: "The totals from the publicly revealed ballots - which are almost all from active baseball writers - are much more favorable to Bonds and Clemens [both had more than 70% on the public ballots] than the private voters, who tend to be the retired writers or football writers who used to cover baseball and the like."
The miracle in all this is that sports writers were somehow designated as arbiters of morality. I happen to know many sports writers - I am one - and I can tell you that not unlike a lot of professions, this one is riddled with hypocrites, weirdos, jerks, jock-sniffers, back-stabbers and narcissists. And that's just the Penguins beat over the past 20 years.
You have some fine people, too, and from afar I've always considered ESPN's Buster Olney one. Here's Olney from 2012 on the wording of the so-called "character" or "integrity" clause, which states voters are to "base their vote not just upon a player's record and ability but also his 'integrity, sportsmanship [and] character.' "
"The truth is that the character clause has been an almost entirely obsolete entity in Hall of Fame voting except when writers wield it like zealous vice principals and pluck one or two decorum violators from a hallway of humanity and assign them detention in baseball purgatory. The wording is believed to have been written by longtime baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The fact that Landis was a segregationist who endeavored to keep blacks out of baseball should have compelled writers to ignore the questions of character and integrity."
It didn't, although legendary baseball writer Peter Gammons is one who finally saw the light two years ago, writing, "The Hall of Fame is the museum of baseball history, hence I am at the point where the best player in the last 40 years [Bonds] and arguably the pitcher ever [Clemens] need to be parts of that museum, with whatever addendum is deemed necessary for their plaques."
It's not like the voters are bathing themselves in glory on other fronts. One decided it would be cool to reject Derek Jeter on Tuesday (at least the other 396 got that one right), and Larry Walker somehow went from receiving 15.5% of the vote in 2016 to getting elected. Did I miss Walker's MVP season of 2018, at age 52? What did he do to change so many minds in four years?
Some voters checked something like 10 boxes on their ballot this year. Why not just go ahead and induct Aki Iwamura and his knee brace while you're at it, guys?
By all means keep Bonds and Clemens on the porch. Because they apparently used steroids during an era in which Jose Canseco estimated up to 85% of all players did the same.
Let's take those two and punish them forever.
I'm sure Kenesaw Mountain Landis would be proud.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court's conservative justices were seen as inclined to endorse a Montana program that provided tax incentives to those who fund scholarships for families to use at religious schools.
While liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned at Wednesday's oral argument that it would be a "radical" departure for the court, her ideological counterparts said excluding religious institutions from government programs open to others could amount to unconstitutional discrimination similar to racial bias.
The outcome and breadth of the decision seem to depend on Chief Justice John Roberts, who generally has been part of the court's modern movement to loosen the rules regarding church and state separations. He usually prefers the court to move in incremental ways.
Justice Roberts, 64, was looking none the worse for wear while taking the bench less than eight hours after presiding over a marathon session of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. He made no mention of his double duties, but the court acknowledged it scheduled only one oral argument Wednesday in anticipation of his Senate service.
The importance of the case was underscored by the number of people who camped out in freezing temperatures on the Supreme Court's sidewalk to get inside. The lucky ones joined Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has made including religious schools in school choice programs a priority and who sat in the front row.
At issue was an initiative passed by the Montana legislature in 2015 that provided dollar-for-dollar tax credits up to $150 to those who donated to scholarship programs for low-income parents to send their children to private schools.
The program made no distinction as to whether parents could use the scholarships at religious or secular schools. About 70% of private schools in the state are religious.
The Montana Supreme Court said that ran counter to a state constitutional prohibition against using public funds for religious institutions and schools. Instead of saying the program could fund only secular schools, it struck down the tax credit program.
"The only reason the court invalidated the program was because it included religious schools," said Richard Komer, who was representing the parents on behalf of the libertarian Institute for Justice. He said that ruling singled out religious parents and violated the U.S. Constitution's protection of the free exercise of religion.
But liberal justices defended the Montana Supreme Court's action to level down (getting rid of the program) rather than level up (making it available for use at all schools).
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned whether the parents even had standing to bring the case, because they were being treated no differently from parents who sent their children to secular private schools.
"Where is the harm?" she asked.
Justice Elena Kagan picked up on that. "Because of the [Montana] Supreme Court's ruling, whether you go to a religious school or you go to a secular private school, you're in the same boat at this point," she said, adding, "There is no discrimination at this point going on, is there?"
Justice Sotomayor wondered about the extent of Mr. Komer's argument. "Are you saying that states are forced to give money both to secular and religious schools?" she asked.
Mr. Komer noted the money was given to parents who made the choice of school. But he added, "If they give to one [family], they must give to the other." He said the Montana court's remedy of striking the entire program did not shield it from charges of discriminating against parents who favored religious schools.
The high court in 2017 said Missouri could not ban a church school from requesting a grant from a state program that rehabilitated playgrounds. Justice Kagan and fellow liberal Justice Stephen Breyer joined that decision but indicated Wednesday that religious education was different.
Justice Breyer noted the Constitution's prohibition on government establishment of religion. "There is nothing more religious, except perhaps for the service in the church itself, than religious education," Justice Breyer said. "That's how we create a future for our religion."
Justice Breyer was reacting in part to the argument of Deputy Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall; the Trump administration is supporting the parents.

Better options are needed for foster kids; Children are landing in shelters, hotels, out-of-state facilities and institutions.

Texto completo: The latest controversy roiling American foster care is all about children forced into inappropriate settings.
A Washington Post report on Dec. 30 noted that across the country "case workers and courts have been funneling children into crowded emergency shelters, hotels, out-of-state institutions and youth prisons -- cold, isolating and often dangerous facilities not built to house innocent children for years."
"With few available beds in therapeutic care in Washington State," reads a recent op-ed in the New York Times, "foster youth, especially those of color, are frequently forced to stay in hotels."

A Better Childhood has filed suit against 10 states in part because they assign children to "institutional facilities and group homes that ignore their needs, disabilities, and case history." The nonprofit advocacy organization has documented placements outside the state that serves as the child's guardian and situations where youngsters with no criminal record are housed in prison conditions.
Ironically, government policies meant to improve how and where kids are housed are behind these bad decisions. In an effort to prioritize family placements (foster and adoptive), jurisdictions have closed and reduced the funding for group homes. Less money means fewer "congregate care" facilities. Now when families can't be found to take in children, or when a family setting simply won't work, states, counties and municipalities are scrambling. And the situation is only getting worse.
Over the last 50 years, the child welfare establishment has come to a consensus: Growing up in an institution is not good for children; every child deserves a family. Orphanages have long been stigmatized and, for the most part, shuttered. Many deserved their bad reputations, but Dickensian assumptions aside, the data are mixed. UC Irvine emeritus economist Richard McKenzie, who grew up in a Presbyterian kids home in the 1950s, found in a survey of 2,500 orphanage alumni in the 1990s that 85% looked back "favorably" or "very favorably" on their experience.
"Only 2.3 percent of the alumni had hostile assessments," McKenzie wrote in an essay in the Weekly Standard. "Moreover, the alumni reported that they had done better than the general population on almost all measures, including education, income, attitude toward life, criminal records, psychological problems, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and happiness."
Nevertheless, the modern foster care system has been doing all it can to end congregate care except for juvenile offenders (detention centers, in other words) or for children who require treatment programs.
To meet the goal of family placements, states have mounted elaborate ad campaigns to recruit more parents. In some jurisdictions, nurses and counselors are offered specialized training and increased fees to take in children in need of medical or psychological care in order to keep them from congregate settings. This year, the Department of Health and Human Services embarked on a PR effort specifically to attract adoptive parents for teens in the foster system, a population for whom homes are often difficult to find. But even with outsized efforts, most child welfare programs can't fill the need for foster families.
At the same time, some children, teens especially, don't want to be fostered or adopted by a family. They may have experienced multiple placements and prefer a group setting to trying to fit once more into a family unit. Some have behavioral problems that torpedo adjusting to family life. According to a 2012 report from the Health and Human Services Child Welfare Information Gateway, "disruption rates" -- meaning that a child is adopted and then "returned"-- range from about 10% to 25% nationwide. For older kids, the numbers tend to be higher.
Despite the "family first" consensus, there is a need for group homes that aren't hospitals or jails. Nonetheless, the incentives in terms of public relations and public dollars are all on the side of reducing congregate care. Marie Cohen, author of the blog Child Welfare Monitor, noted that disconnect in a 2019 report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation. The much-publicized study, wrote Cohen, "praised those jurisdictions with lower group home percentages" while "chastising those with higher rates."
"Nowhere," wrote Cohen, "did the authors mention the fact that eliminating too many congregate placements may lead to foster youth staying in offices, hotels, emergency placements, and abusive out-of-state facilities."
In 2015, the California Legislature enacted the Continuum of Care Reform Act specifically to reduce reliance on group facilities and force the system to increase family placements. It didn't eliminate all group homes, but it designated such settings primarily as a short-term solution for youngsters certified as having a medical or criminal problem that required a restrictive environment. The state estimated that it would quickly move 65% of its group home population to families. Instead it found it was only able to transfer 35%. With fewer group beds available, it had to assign many children to medical and detention facilities who didn't require such settings.
Unfortunately, the Family First Prevention Services Act, which passed Congress in 2018 with bipartisan support, is modeled on California's program. It is already leading states away from congregant care, limiting the kinds of facilities that can be funded by federal dollars and by adding regulatory burdens to group placements. For example, even group homes that aren't specifically set up for medical treatment must have 24-7 clinical staff to qualify for federal funding.
We should do as much as possible to place foster kids in loving temporary or permanent family homes. But just reducing the options for this vulnerable population is not the answer.

President hints at changes in Medicare

Texto completo: President Trump appeared to express a new openness to revamping entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare in an interview aired Wednesday, potentially opening the door to overhauling two of America's largest government programs if he is elected to a second term.
Speaking with CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said tackling entitlement spending is "the easiest of all things" and seemed to suggest higher economic growth would make it easier to reduce spending on those programs. It was unclear exactly what changes the president was envisioning and the White House did not immediately respond to a request to clarify.
"At the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look," Trump said. He later added when asked about entitlements: "Well, we're going — we're going look. We also have — assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this."
It was unclear what Trump was referring to when he mentioned unprecedented growth. The economy is growing but not as fast as it has in the past, though the stock market is at record levels.
Adding to the confusion are private remarks Trump recently made that appeared to dismiss the importance of the budget deficit, which has ballooned to about $1 trillion a year under his administration.
Trump as a 2016 presidential candidate promised not to cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security, a position typically more in line with Democratic lawmakers that set him apart from the rest of the GOP field. His budget proposals as president, however, have called for slight reductions in Medicare and bigger changes to Medicaid spending. He is also seeking curbs to Social Security disability programs but he has not pursued changes to Social Security benefits for older Americans.

Trump says injuries minor for soldiers in Iran attack
President Trump addressed injuries suffered by US troops in Iran's recent ballistic missile attack on Wednesday, saying he that can "report it is not very serious" and that defense officials told him about them days after the fact.
"I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things," he said. "But I would say, and I can report it is not very serious. Not very serious."
The comments came after the Pentagon acknowledged Tuesday evening that more US service members have been removed from Iraq for treatment and testing after suffering from concussion-like symptoms caused by the Jan. 8 attack on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, in which 11 ballistic missiles caused deep craters and charred wreckage.
Trump and defense officials initially said that no one was injured, but the Pentagon reported last week that 11 service members had left on flights to receive follow-up treatment. Defense officials said Tuesday that even more had left, but declined to say how many or address questions about whether anyone has been sent back to the United States.
Air Force Major General Alex Grynkewich, a senior commander for the US mission in Iraq and Syria, told reporters outside Washington on Wednesday that the injured were "looked at for TBI," an acronym for traumatic brain injury that can range from a mild concussion to something more serious.
The Pentagon considers TBI to be a signature wound of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and acknowledges that some can be debilitating. More than 313,800 service members have suffered one in combat or training, according to a Defense Department fact sheet.

Sanders, Biden take top spots in two national pollsA new national poll shows Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont with a lead in a national debate qualifying poll for the first time in the 2020 Democratic primary, while a second national survey shows former vice president Joe Biden in front.
The first poll, conducted by SSRS for CNN and released Wednesday morning, showed Sanders with 27 percent support and Biden following closely behind at 24 percent support. It was the first time Sanders has led nationally since Biden entered the race in April, though his lead was within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The second poll, released later by Monmouth University, showed a different picture, with Biden in the lead at 30 percent support and Sanders in second with 23 percent. In both polls, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts finished third with 14 percent support.
Former mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York traded places in the polls, with Buttigieg coming in fourth in CNN's poll with 11 percent and fifth in Monmouth's with 6 percent, and Bloomberg finishing fourth in Monmouth's with 9 percent and fifth in CNN's with 5 percent.
No other candidate garnered more than 5 percent support in either of the polls.
Sanders has shown particular signs of strength in some early-state polls, leading a highly anticipated poll of Iowa caucusgoers conducted by The Des Moines Register/CNN and a CBS/YouGov tracking poll of New Hampshire primary voters, both released this month.

Texto completo: With the impeachment trial moving forward and the Iowa caucuses around the corner, it's never the wrong time to analyze Donald Trump's reelection chances. If you care about unseating him, it doesn't help to underestimate him, or his appeal.
Just ask Hillary Clinton.
Steve Bannon has told anyone who will listen that he won the 2016 election for Trump by hammering home three issues: immigration, the economy, and disentanglement from foreign wars. If those worked four years ago, there is no reason why they won't work a second time.
Trump attracts plenty of ridicule for his promise-mongering about the “wall" with Mexico, but the unbuilt wall can do the same job in 2020 as the hypothetical wall did in 2016 — e.g., “Reelect me, I have to finish what Nancy Pelosi prevented me from doing, blah blah blah."
Trump's, harsh, cruelty-first immigration policies haven't won him many friends in the commentariat, or in states where immigration and asylum issues aren't integrally connected to the local economy, i.e., Massachusetts. But he will run on his record.
A Trump ad aired last fall claims “he has cut illegal immigration in half" — an exaggeration, to put it mildly. Yet The Washington Post recently reported that “the number of migrants taken into custody along the US-Mexico border has started to plateau after several straight months of decline."
He grasped the nettle, as he promised to do.
Nobel Prize winners are never going to praise Trumponomics (Paul Krugman on Election Day, 2016: “Markets are plunging"), but in a presidential campaign, three pocketbook issues matter: (1) Is inflation under control? (2) Is gasoline more expensive? and (3) Do I have a job?
The election is several months away, but for now the answers for most Americans are Yes, No, and Yes. Advantage Trump.
Concerning foreign entanglements, Trump's foreign policy can be politely described as incoherent. American troop deployments overseas have either declined or remained steady, depending on whom you choose to believe. When Trump was elected, my greatest fear was that he would provoke a war on the Korean peninsula. That hasn't happened, which either exposes my poor judgment or means that Trump has acted with more restraint than I thought he would.
Trumpism spawned a spate of wheezy “Death of Democracy" articles in “thought leader" publications, e.g., The Atlantic's “How America Ends" or The New York Times's “How Democracy Dies." What a charade. Trump loves democracy! American democracy has provided him with a tricked-out Boeing 747 that he can fly down to Florida to play golf, any day he wants. Not just on weekends.
Democracy is grand!
Further proof that Trump loves democracy: He has injected himself into several closely contested state elections since he became president. (Louisiana, Kentucky, and Alabama come to mind.) With mixed results, to be sure. But there is no reason to think he won't contest this next election, and vigorously. It'll be worth it just to keep flying his Golf Shuttle, formerly known as Air Force One.
Ah, I hear you say, but people despise Donald Trump. That is true. In one poll, 69 percent of the respondents said they dislike Trump's admittedly loathsome personality. But the Trump campaign has that angle covered: “He's no Mr. Nice Guy," an ad that ran during the 2019 World Series declared, “but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington."
It's easy to write off Trump as a psychiatric basket case, or an Adolf Hitler wannabe. The truth is much starker: He is a formidable candidate for reelection to the presidency of the United States.

Texto completo: Patrick Stewart returns to "Star Trek" in a new streaming show. And a "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff begins its third season on ABC.
What's Streaming
STAR TREK: PICARD Stream on CBS All Access. "Tea, Earl Grey, decaf." That's Jean-Luc Picard's new beverage order in "Picard," the latest "Star Trek" TV series and a return to the franchise for Patrick Stewart, who plays the title character. (For those not hip enough for "Star Trek" references: The order used to be "tea, Earl Grey, hot.") The new show finds Picard -- the erstwhile commander of the famous fictional starship known as the Enterprise -- in reflective form, grappling with the past as an aged version of himself. It has a starry showrunner in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Michael Chabon, who will presumably bring a new kind of energy to the franchise. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Stewart said he was drawn to the new story because it explored "the profound psychological differences in the character, who felt abandoned, distrusted and unnecessary." Stewart asked, "Where is he now? What matters to him? What control does he have over his life? Very little, as it turned out."
RUSSELL PETERS: DEPORTED Stream on Amazon. The Canadian comic Russell Peters discusses topics like mean internet comments and the experience of getting an endoscopy in this new stand-up special, filmed at a stadium in Mumbai. Peters takes advantage of having such a large audience to banter with several of the audience members -- including a man who offers an endoscopy story of his own.
SAINT LAURENT (2015) Rent on Amazon, Google Play and iTunes. The French director Bertrand Bonello is back in theaters this weekend with "Zombi Child," a drama that flits between Haiti and France. In this biopic, Bonello flits from one decade to another to explore the life of the fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. The movie casts multiple different actors as Laurent, painting a portrait of an over-the-top perfectionist both in his prime and toward the end of his life. "The film is a compulsively detailed swirl of moods and impressions, intent on capturing the contradictions of the man and his times," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times. "Observations of Saint Laurent at work and in love give way to panoramic, intricate surveys of the world of commerce and culture in which he suffered and flourished."
What's on TV
STATION 19 8 p.m. on ABC. The previous season of this "Grey's Anatomy" spinoff ended with some of its main characters -- a group of firefighters -- being called down to Los Angeles to battle a wildfire. The crew is back in its native Seattle at the start of Season 3, which kicks off with a crisis: A car crashes into a bar. Expect drama to come both from a high-stakes rescue and from interpersonal relationships.
THE GAYLE KING GRAMMY SPECIAL 10 p.m. on CBS. The TV anchor Gayle King interviews Lizzo, Billie Eilish, the Jonas Brothers, Lil Nas X and other musicians in this special, which airs in advance of the Grammy Awards on Sunday.

Texto completo: Before Sen. Bernie Sanders jetted off from a Des Moines rally early this week to impeachment hearings that have him locked down far from Iowa, the candidate remarked on how prescient his presidential campaign slogan turned out to be.
" 'Us, Not Me' is becoming very much a reality in the last two weeks of this campaign," the Vermont senator told the crowd of more than 700 -- slightly rewording his "Not Me, Us" slogan.
"Because I am not going to be able to be here as much as I would like. So you guys are going to have to carry the ball."

As the Iowa campaign comes down to its crucial final stretch, some Democratic senators in the race are better prepared to hand the ball over than others.
For the lawmakers anchored to Washington right now, skills on the stump are suddenly less urgent than a finely tuned and well-funded shadow campaign. The tools of modern politics -- robust social media and rosters of celebrity surrogates, in particular -- are being put to the test as absent candidates try to make their presence felt a thousand miles away.
It's a tough predicament for Sanders and his fellow senators in the presidential race, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado, who are left to fidget in their seats in Washington as impeachment proceedings lumber on. They are not allowed to so much as glance at an Apple Watch for campaign updates (lawmakers who slipped in with the watches have since been instructed to leave them at the door, along with all other electronics).
The hearings are as physically draining as a frantic day on the stump, without the political rewards.
Wednesday, early into the 24 hours of argument that House Democrats are scheduled to present, Sanders was slumping in his chair, hands on belly, struggling to keep his head up. Warren looked to be taking notes and methodically drawing what appeared to be doodles of orderly dots, circles and lines.
She acknowledged that keeping up with her daily regimen of walking 7 miles has been a problem.
"I am way behind right now," Warren told a CNN reporter.
Staying off coffee -- which Warren has forsworn -- is tough amid the marathon days, but the rules allowing only water and milk on the Senate floor help. Warren brings in hot and cold cups of water, and confessed to sneaking in a yogurt.
Rivals are making the most of the senators' absence as the large swath of still-undecided Iowa Democratic voters make their final decisions in advance of the state's Feb. 3 caucuses.
Tuesday night, some 1,200 rallygoers cheered former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg in Cedar Rapids as operatives for the senatorial candidates scrambled to figure out whether their bosses could slip out long enough to interact with voters over livestreams (they couldn't). Hundreds more voters were out again for Buttigieg on Wednesday morning in Dubuque as the senators were back in lockdown.
Asked whether he had seen all the testimony back in Washington, former Vice President Joe Biden told MSNBC on Wednesday morning that he was too busy at campaign events in Iowa.
The stuck senators are plotting all possible moves to stem damage. They are rewriting campaign budgets, straining every ounce of social media muscle, and scouring their contacts for surrogates to dispatch.
Sanders has enlisted crowd favorite Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York congresswoman, to carry the mantle at an Iowa City rally Friday night. He's got Bon Iver lined up for a concert outside Des Moines a week from Friday. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, aka Ben & Jerry, are scooping ice cream for college students on his behalf up and down New Hampshire.
They may bump into Ashley Judd, who will be talking up Warren there all day Friday. In Iowa, Warren has the twin Castro brothers -- former Housing Secretary Julian and Texas congressman Joaquin -- splitting up to make the case for her at nine events over three days.
Lower-profile campaigns promise what they lack in star power will be replaced with grit.
"I will find one way or another to run for president," Klobuchar said outside the Senate chamber. "I actually have my family there [campaigning] right now. They are really good."
Her daughter has taken over Klobuchar's Twitter feed. Klobuchar "hot dish house parties" are scheduled through the state. She had a tele-town hall optimistically planned for 8:30 p.m. Iowa time Wednesday, just after the day's trial session was scheduled to wrap.
Bennet promised tele-town halls and Facebook Live appearances. But such virtual campaigning is a much heavier lift for those cash-poor candidates than it is for Sanders and Warren, who have state-of-the-art production infrastructure and social media followings that enable them -- at a moment's notice -- to amass an audience that might rival that of a cable news broadcast.
Warren was not able to slip out long enough Tuesday to broadcast to voters, so on Wednesday her campaign revised its game plan to focus on taped chats about corruption in Washington that it is calling "big structural conversations."
A sophisticated broadcast operation will help only so much in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters expect to meet their candidates in person -- often multiple times.
Audiences just don't embrace beamed-in candidates the same way they do actual candidates, said David Redlawsk, a political scientist from the University of Delaware traveling Iowa to study the caucuses. He was at an event in Des Moines on Sunday that Buttigieg attended by Skype.
"It was not the same," Redlawsk said. "He wasn't engaged by the crowd."
But being stuck in Washington does come with some campaign advantages. Impeachment dominates the news -- including in Iowa -- and these senators are in the middle of it. The cable news networks are desperate to hear from them on the few breaks the senators have, and every one of those cable hits can be helpful to a campaign.
Biden's awkward role as a focus of the trial also mitigates his advantage of being able to roam Iowa and New Hampshire. Republicans are constantly threatening to call Biden and his son Hunter, as witnesses to address questions about Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine.
Biden was confronted at two different stops in Iowa by questions about whether Democrats were mulling a deal in which Hunter Biden could be called as a witness if John Bolton, a key former administration official, also testified.
"No, they are not," Biden said repeatedly at the first stop when asked about Democrats discussing the idea. Later in the day, he said he would not sign off on such a deal. "This is a constitutional issue," he said. "We're not going to turn it into a farce or political theater. I want no part of that."
Senate Democratic leader Charles E. Schumer of New York said late Wednesday that the idea of such a trade was "off the table."
The candidate who may have the most to lose is Klobuchar. She struggled throughout the race to break into the top tier and was finally showing signs of momentum just before she got yanked back to Washington, having won the endorsement of a major newspaper in Iowa, the Quad Cities Times, and shared another -- with Warren -- from the New York Times.
Like the other candidates tied down in the Senate, Klobuchar is trying to make the best of it. That involves leaning into her role as an impeachment juror.
When one of President Trump's attorneys sniped during the hearings that "some of you are upset because you should be in Iowa," Klobuchar snapped back with a tweet that quickly got 74,000 likes.
"No. This is my constitutional duty. And I can do two things at once."
Times staff writers Noah Bierman and Jennifer Haberkorn in Washington contributed to this report.

PG&amp;E Reaches Deal to Exit Bankruptcy, but Governor Balks

Texto completo: Even before the California utility said it had an accord with bondholders, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that the plan didn't meet the public interest.
Pacific Gas & Electric, the giant California utility, said Wednesday that it had resolved differences with its creditors over how to restructure the company, clearing one of the last major hurdles to its exit from bankruptcy.
But even before the announcement was made, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared that the plan was insufficient. He said it did too little to assure "safe, reliable and affordable power for Californians" after the series of wildfires attributed to the company's equipment.
The company's billions of dollars in liabilities from those fires drove it to seek bankruptcy protection a year ago. The governor's approval of its reorganization plan is essential for PG&E to take part in a $ 20 billion fund intended to help shield the state's utilities from damage claims in future fires.
Mr. Newsom's objections were filed with the federal bankruptcy court hearing the case in San Francisco. The terms of the PG&E agreement with bondholders were to have been considered at a hearing on Thursday, but the judge put off the matter until next week.
Until Wednesday, PG&E and its bondholders had competing plans for sorting out the company's finances.
The plan offered by the bondholders -- including Elliott Management, a large hedge fund, and Pimco, the mutual-fund giant -- had initially gained the support of the group representing wildfire victims in the bankruptcy. The plan would in theory have left PG&E with a stronger financial position once it emerged from bankruptcy. But it would also have almost completely wiped out the current shareholders, dominated by hedge funds.
When the victims shifted their backing to PG&E's plan, the bondholders lost much of their influence over the outcome of the bankruptcy.
The agreement reached Wednesday resolves the interest payments that the bondholders will receive in the period after PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection. The two sides also agreed on the size of "make whole" payments, or the extra amounts given to bondholders when bonds are paid off before they mature.
"Reaching a resolution with the bondholder group is a positive development to move forward with our plan of reorganization," said Bill Johnson, president and chief executive of the utility's parent company, PG&E Corporation. "This agreement helps achieve our goals of fairly compensating wildfire victims, protecting customers' bills and emerging from Chapter 11."
Along with concerns about safety and corporate governance, Mr. Newsom objected to financial aspects of PG&E's plan, contending that it would leave the company "with insufficient financial flexibility to make billions of dollars in critically needed safety investments."
But the bondholders' decision to back the plan isolates Mr. Newsom, who must now decide how hard to push for his objectives. He could use provisions in a state law passed last year to deny PG&E access to the wildfire fund, a move that could cause the company's shares to plunge, putting pressure on the hedge funds. Such an approach could also drag out the bankruptcy and delay payments to wildfire victims.
In a statement, the company said it was taking the governor's concerns seriously. "While PG&E has made substantial progress in resolving victim claims and restructuring our finances, additional changes to the plan are forthcoming. We will continue to engage with the governor's office to address his concerns," the company said.
The bondholders played a big role in getting a larger sum for the victims. PG&E initially offered $ 8.4 billion but then raised the amount to $ 13.5 billion, the sum that the bondholders had offered to pay.
Wildfire victims remain skeptical. They plan a protest in Sacramento on Friday morning in opposition to profits that shareholders could make in the bankruptcy deal and plans to fund part of the company's damage payments with stock.
"Investor groups have hijacked the bankruptcy process to ensure that they reap billions more in profits while individual fire victims receive cents on the dollar, are paid in installments, and have their recoveries funded in large part by stock in the restructured PG&E," said Helen Sedwick, a lawyer who lost her Santa Rosa home to the 2017 wildfires. "Fire victims do not want to own any part of the company that burned their homes and killed their neighbors."
The utility's role in the last three years of wildfires -- along with the pre-emptive blackouts PG&E imposed last year when wildfire danger was at its greatest -- led residents and local government officials to call for a takeover of the utility, with some proposing a government-run operation, and others seeking to create a customer-owned cooperative.
Mr. Newsom said he would consider all options if PG&E failed to pay enough money to meet wildfire victims' claims and ensure that employees' jobs were protected. He also demanded a safety plan that would help prevent future wildfires and a strategy that continued to meet the state's goals to transform the electric grid into a carbon-free system.

Texto completo: A reader says her remarks about nobody liking Bernie Sanders are "meanspirited and divisive."
To the Editor:
Re "'Nobody Likes Him': Clinton's Shot at Sanders Rattles Democrats" (front page, Jan. 22):
I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and am undecided as to which Democratic Party candidate I will support in 2020. However, I find Mrs. Clinton's comments about Senator Bernie Sanders to be meanspirited and divisive.
Nobody likes him? Millions of people supported his campaign in 2016 and are doing so again in 2020. Furthermore, Mr. Sanders supported and campaigned for Mrs. Clinton after she won the nomination. What a bizarre way to repay that support.
Mrs. Clinton would do well to make fewer public comments during this campaign, and when she must comment, she should think before she speaks. We must work for party unity and keep our eyes on the prize -- defeating President Trump. Personal attacks against a leading Democratic candidate will only increase Mr. Trump's chances of winning re-election.

Texto completo: Jeter fell one anonymous vote short of being unanimously elected into the Hall of Fame, but he said he would "focus on the ones who did" name him.
Derek Jeter could hardly contain his glee over being elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame. At a news conference in Midtown Manhattan on Wednesday, a day after being elected, Jeter flashed his famous smile almost nonstop and made perhaps as many jokes in a public setting as he has over the last decade combined.
Jeter, often guarded in public, poked fun at his former teammate Mariano Rivera, at his father for claiming to be a better shortstop, at Larry Walker's SpongeBob SquarePants shirt (Walker was wearing it on Tuesday, when he found out that he, too was elected to the Hall of Fame).
But there was one shot Jeter would not take, and that was at the lone voter who declined to put Jeter on the Hall of Fame ballot.
"I focus on the ones who did," Jeter said, referring to the 99.7 percent of voters who felt he deserved induction into the Hall of Fame. "It takes a lot of people to all agree to get you to this point. So, I'm not thinking about that."
Jeter received 396 of a possible 397 votes, easily clearing the 75 percent threshold for induction but barely missing out on becoming the second player, after Rivera last year, to be unanimously elected into the Hall of Fame.
That one unknown ballot has ignited a firestorm of sorts over who submitted it, and whether the rules should be changed to end anonymous voting. While hundreds of voters opt to make their ballots public every year, it is not required, and many choose to keep their ballots anonymous. One such voter declined to include Jeter.
When the subject came up on Wednesday, it created a brief, awkward moment that underscored the hand-wringing over this year's results.
At one point a spokesman for the Hall of Fame said the matter was in the hands of the Baseball Writers Association of America, which is commissioned by the Hall to conduct the vote. But that was not correct, and it prompted Jack O'Connell, the secretary-treasure of the BBWAA, to correct the record.
As Jeter and Walker looked on somewhat bewildered, O'Connell clarified that the BBWAA had made a request several years ago to make all the ballots public.
But the Hall of Fame denied the request, reasoning that if voters were required to make their votes public, they could be susceptible to outside pressure, preventing them from voting according to their conscience. (The New York Times's reporters do not vote in the Hall of Fame election.)
"They turned that down and said they preferred that the individual decide whether he or she wishes to make the ballot public," O'Connell said of the Hall. "That's the option each voter has."
The BBWAA also votes on the yearly player awards, like the Most Valuable Player and Cy Young Awards, and all of those ballots are public.
The Hall of Fame debated the merits and pitfalls of the BBWAA's proposal, but Jane Forbes Clark, the chairwoman of the Hall of Fame, said that they had concluded that anonymous ballots were essential to preserving a free election.
And the fervor with which many people have vilified the unknown dissenting voice has not made the Hall of Fame any more inclined to change the process. Clark, who sat on the stage next to Jeter, was asked if the board of directors was comfortable with the current format.
"Yes, we are," she said.
But Jeter and Walker were uninterested in the logistics of how they were elected, only that they got in. Jeter learned on Wednesday that his plaque will go next to Rivera's at the Hall in Cooperstown, N.Y., which is fitting. The two players went through the Yankees minor league system together, made their major league debuts during the same month in 1995, were sent back to the minors on the same day that same year, and played virtually their entire careers alongside one another, except for the lone season, in 2014, that Jeter played after Rivera had retired.
"It's an honor just to be in the Hall of Fame," Jeter quipped. "I don't care where they put me. They can put me in the rest room."
Both Jeter and Walker discussed the hardships and trials they faced early in their professional careers after signing as teenagers -- Jeter joining the Yankees in 1992 and Walker joining the Montreal Expos in 1984. Walker spent six years with the Expos, parts of 10 seasons with the Colorado Rockies and one and a half with the St. Louis Cardinals.
He announced that he would go into the Hall of Fame as a member of the Rockies, in part because of the 258 home runs and 1.044 on-base plus slugging percentage he accumulated with that team.
"I spent 10 years in Colorado," he said, "where the majority of my damage was done."
For Jeter, all his damage was done with the Yankees, over 20 years in which he fulfilled a childhood dream to wear their pinstripes, won five championships, and ultimately compelled 396 writers to send him to Cooperstown.
"I'm most proud that I was a Yankee," he said. "It was the only thing I ever wanted to do as long as I could remember, to play shortstop for the New York Yankees. When it's all said and done, that's what I'm most proud of."

Texto completo: A handful of simple items can help you organize your fridge the way the pros do, to avoid wasting both food and time.
I come from a family of condiment hoarders. We love pickles, spreads, and sauces, but we can't ever seem to finish them. This used to result in a Jenga-like situation in my fridge, with jars poised to topple out and break a toe every time I reached for the milk.
Then, in my early 20s, I started working in professional kitchens and had to adhere to strictly enforced rules for keeping food-storage areas tidy. In restaurants, organization is important not only because it helps cooks move quickly and smoothly but also because wasted food is wasted money.
The same is true at home. You may not see the effects of a chaotic fridge in a bad Yelp review or a balance sheet, but they will show in the time it takes to cook dinner and the stress involved. It's been years since my last bakery shift, but I still use what I learned there to keep my leftovers, produce, and other perishables in order. In collaboration with Wirecutter, a product review site owned by the New York Times Company, here are three ways to improve your fridge organization.
Clean out and define zones
The first step toward decluttering your fridge is to take everything out. I mean everything. Deal with the moldy meat sauce you've been avoiding, and Kondo all your condiments. If that half-eaten jar of artisanal lemon curd doesn't spark joy, toss it.
When you're ready to refill the fridge, avoid treating it like a junk drawer for food. Designate different areas for different types of items. Your fridge probably comes with a few predetermined zones -- crisper drawers, cheese drawer -- but you can create more with trays or bins. Restaurants often keep smaller containers together on rimmed baking sheets, which are easy to pull out to get a better look. Wirecutter recommends the Nordic Ware Naturals Baker's Half Sheet, which also comes in smaller, ¼ and ⅛ sizes that may fit better in some fridges. (These are, of course, great for baking, too, in a pinch.) For loose items like lemons, clear bins work better. You can find them in all shapes and sizes at a place like the Container Store.
Another great way to keep ingredients from getting lost in the back of the fridge is to use a lazy Susan (We recommend the OXO Good Grips Turntable). I use mine for basic ingredients we use daily, like mayo, yogurt, nut butter, and our bin of lemons and limes.
A basic understanding of food safety can help you decide what should go where in your fridge. Fridges are typically coldest toward the back and bottom, warmer on the top shelf, and warmest in the door. So the door is great for condiments with a long shelf life, like jam, mustard, and hot sauce, but try to avoid storing milk there unless you'll drink it fast. Raw meat should always go at the bottom of the fridge -- not only for the cold temperatures, but also because you don't want a leaky package dripping chicken juice over everything else.
Beyond that, organize your fridge around how you cook and eat: Put the things you use often (or want to finish) front and center, and store ingredients you'll use only occasionally in corners that are harder to reach.

Impose order on your leftovers
You'll find it easier to maintain order with a good set of food-storage containers. The best ones are clear and stackable, making it easy to see what you have at a glance. I prefer shallow containers to tall, deli-style quart containers, which can obscure the stuff behind them. For several great options in either plastic or glass, check out Wirecutter's guide to the best food storage containers.
Even with the best containers, it helps to have a system for managing leftovers. One of the cardinal rules of any restaurant fridge is FIFO: first in, first out. This means that new items always go to the back, pushing older food to the front of the line, where it's guaranteed to get used up first. To do the same thing at home, you'll need to spend a little extra time putting away groceries or leftovers, but it will save time later on: Rather than rummaging around for the open jar of tomato sauce, you'll have the food that needs to be finished right at your fingertips. Using trays or bins makes it easier to follow the FIFO rule, since you can pull everything out.
Write it all down
In restaurants, absolutely everything gets labeled with its name and the date. At home, that can help prevent the beef stew that you freeze from becoming a murky mystery container in three months. I (and most restaurants I know) like to use a Sharpie and painter's tape (We recommend green FrogTape) for labeling because the label stays on securely but comes off cleanly.
For our tiny, dark freezer, which is usually packed to the brim, my husband went one step beyond labeling and stuck a white board to the wall, so we can keep track of what we have without opening the door. We list everything in the freezer that needs to get eaten, from frozen waffles to salmon fillets, and consult the list when we're planning dinner or writing our grocery list (which lives on the other half of the white board).
If you have trouble using up all the vegetables in your fridge or remembering to finish off leftovers, the same system might help there, too. You can also look for a magnetic white board that will stick right to your fridge, if you'd rather not hang anything.
If, even after your best efforts, clutter starts to return (it happens to me!), just try to nip it in the bud before you have another leaning tower of Tupperware situation. Cook a clean-out-the-fridge meal, and use your condiments for a fancy toast-toppings bar. And when you really need to, pull it all out and start over.

Texto completo: U.N. experts lent their weight to allegations that Saudi Arabia's crown prince hacked the cellphone of Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, to "influence, if not silence," its reporting.
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- United Nations experts broadened the inquiry into Saudi Arabia's efforts to squelch criticism on Wednesday, accusing its crown prince of personally hacking the cellphone of Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of The Washington Post, to "influence, if not silence" the newspaper's critical coverage of the kingdom.
The accusations, by two prominent United Nations rights experts, threatened to hamper efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to shake off the stigma of the 2018 murder and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents in Istanbul.
The experts did not directly investigate the hack, which The New York Times could not independently verify. But giving their imprimatur to an outside investigation bolstered criticism of the kingdom's covert efforts to silence critical voices and widened the possibilities of who could be targeted.
"The hacking of Jeff Bezos is in a different league," said Agnes Callamard, one of the United Nations experts. "He is not a Saudi citizen. He is a person of strategic interest, and his hacking appears to have been driven by his ownership of The Washington Post."
According to a statement by the two experts on Wednesday, Mr. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, received an encrypted video from a WhatsApp account belonging to Prince Mohammed that was loaded with digital spyware. By watching the video, Mr. Bezos enabled surveillance of his cellphone starting in May 2018. Ms. Callamard said that the surveillance was believed to have continued for nine months, until February 2019.
During his rise, Prince Mohammed, a son of the Saudi king, has pushed to open Saudi society by letting women drive and expanding entertainment opportunities. But he also has overseen a wide-ranging crackdown on dissidents at home and abroad.
In recent years, technology researchers and human rights groups have documented cases of operators who appear to be working for Saudi Arabia infiltrating the communications devices of well-known Saudi dissidents and manipulating social media in the kingdom to amplify voices praising Prince Mohammed and drown out his critics.
But targeting the cellphone of an American citizen who is one of the world's richest businessmen would be a clear escalation.
The Saudi Embassy in Washington on Wednesday called the idea that the kingdom had hacked Mr. Bezos' cellphone "absurd" and did not respond to a request for comment about the hacking of Saudi dissidents.
The hacking of Mr. Bezos is particularly sensitive because of his ownership of The Post, which had published coverage critical of the kingdom and had retained Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident Saudi writer, as a regular columnist. Mr. Khashoggi had fled Saudi Arabia for the United States and often criticized Prince Mohammed in his columns.
Six months after the hack of Mr. Bezos' phone, Mr. Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul, where he had gone to obtain papers needed to marry his Turkish fiancée. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Prince Mohammed most likely ordered the murder. He and other Saudi officials deny he played a role.
Last year, Mr. Bezos accused American Media Inc., the tabloid publisher, of "extortion and blackmail" after it exposed his extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez and threatened to publish graphic photos if he did not publicly state that reporting by The National Enquirer was not motivated by political concerns.
Mr. Bezos suggested that the company had been doing the bidding of Saudi Arabia. The Enquirer's parent company has said Ms. Sanchez's brother, Michael, was the sole source of the texts and intimate photos it acquired.
In their statement on Wednesday, the United Nations experts also accused Saudi Arabia of starting vast social media campaigns to tar the image of Mr. Bezos after the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.
"At a time when Saudi Arabia was supposedly investigating the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and prosecuting those it deemed responsible, it was clandestinely waging a massive online campaign against Mr. Bezos and Amazon targeting him principally as the owner of The Washington Post," the experts said.
Mr. Bezos did not comment on the hack, but posted a photo of himself on Twitter on Wednesday standing beside Mr. Khashoggi's Turkish fiancée and with his hand resting on a stone bearing Mr. Khashoggi's name. The caption read, "#Jamal."
Saudi officials have not revealed the whereabouts of Mr. Khashoggi's remains.
The United Nations experts -- Ms. Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression -- both investigated Mr. Khashoggi's murder and based their assessment of the hack on a forensic investigation carried out at Mr. Bezos' request.
The hack of Mr. Bezos' phone came at the start of a two-month period in mid-2018 when at least four Saudi dissidents living abroad reported having their devices hacked with technologies similar to that found to have been deployed against Mr. Bezos.
They included Omar Abdulaziz, a dissident in Canada with a large social media following; an unidentified researcher for Amnesty International; Yahya Assiri, who runs a human rights monitor in London; and Ghanem al-Masarir, who hosts a YouTube show from Britain that skewers the Saudi leadership.
The United Nations experts said that, taken together, the cases pointed to "a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities."
Mr. al-Masarir, who said his two cellphones had been hacked in June 2018, said by phone on Wednesday that the kingdom used hacking as a low-cost way to keep an eye on people it disliked.
"It is a way to spy on you all the time without sending 1,000 people to follow you around," he said. "Instead, they are in your phone and they hear you and see you and know who you are with."
The Saudi Embassy in Washington, in denying responsibility for the hacking of Mr. Bezos' phone, called for an investigation but did not say who should carry it out.
The hacking accusations add to the pressures on Prince Mohammed -- essentially accusing him of new criminality while the kingdom is trying to overcome the negative news coverage of its nearly five-year-old military intervention in Yemen, its blockade of Qatar, its short-lived holding of the prime minister of Lebanon in 2017 and the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.
The awkwardness has been compounded by Saudi Arabia's assumption of the presidency of the Group of 20 and the expectation it will host the group's summit meeting this year, opening the kingdom's doors to leaders of the world's most developed countries.
The hacking could also complicate relations between the Saudi government and the Trump administration, which has stood by Prince Mohammed despite an international outcry over Mr. Khashoggi's killing and the assessment by Mr. Trump's own intelligence services that the crown prince was most likely involved.
Mr. Trump has exalted Prince Mohammed as a reliable Arab ally and buyer of American weapons. Prince Mohammed is also close with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and the two men chat frequently on WhatsApp, according to former White House officials.
The United Nations experts called on the United States and "other relevant authorities" to immediately investigate the hack of Mr. Bezos' phone.
Their statement cited a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr. Bezos' phone that assessed with "medium to high confidence" that his phone had been infiltrated on May 1, 2018, via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account used personally by the Saudi crown prince. The report, which was reviewed by The New York Times, indicated that Mr. Bezos continued to receive messages from the crown prince's WhatsApp account after Mr. Khashoggi's death.
The report was carried out at Mr. Bezos' request by the business advisory firm FTI Consulting and given to the United Nations experts by Mr. Bezos' associates for their assessment. Messages sent by the crown prince's account throughout 2018 suggested that he had intimate knowledge of Mr. Bezos' private life.
On Nov. 8, 2018, the report said, Mr. Bezos received a message from the account that included a single photo of a woman who resembled Ms. Sanchez. The photo was captioned, "Arguing with a woman is like reading the software license agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree."
At the time, Mr. Bezos and his wife were discussing a divorce, which would have been apparent to someone reading his text messages.
Mr. Bezos and Prince Mohammed, the report said, exchanged phone numbers at a dinner in Los Angeles in April 2018. The crown prince initiated a messaging conversation with Mr. Bezos that same day over WhatsApp.

Emails Show Budget Office Working to Carry Out Ukraine Aid Freeze

Texto completo: The communications about President Trump's order to hold up military assistance to Ukraine were released under a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit.
The same morning last July when President Trump had his fateful call with Ukraine's president, White House officials were working behind the scenes to impose the freeze sought by the president on military assistance to Ukraine, reviewing the legal wording they would use to implement the hold, emails released late Tuesday night show.
The emails were released as a result of a Freedom of Information lawsuit, even as the Senate was rejecting a series of resolutions introduced by Democrats intended to force the disclosure of some of these same materials from the White House's Office of Management and Budget and other agencies involved in the aid freeze.
The 192 pages of documents, released just before a midnight deadline to the nonprofit group American Oversight, do not contain major new revelations in terms of the participants in the aid freeze or the sequence of events beyond what had been detailed by The New York Times in the last month based on interviews and documents.
But it does offer new evidence of the friction between the Defense Department and the White House as the aid freeze dragged on through the summer, and the confusion and surprise when members of Congress, including some prominent Republicans, learned that the military assistance to Ukraine had been held up.
An aide to Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a leader of group that promotes Ukraine's interests in the Senate, wrote on Aug. 23 to Michael P. Duffey, a political appointee from the Office of Management and Budget who instituted the freeze.
The aide noted that Mr. Portman "is very interested in ensuring Ukraine has the military capabilities it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression," adding that "I would appreciate if you could lay out for me the reason behind the O.M.B. hold and what the process is for getting the funding released."
Calls and emails for an explanation also had come in from Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Representative Mac Thornberry, Republican of Texas, the ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, the emails show.
The White House aides, in the documents, did not offer an explanation for the aid freeze, and instead simply worked to figure out who should respond.
The friction with the Pentagon was obvious in email exchanges between the Office of Management and Budget and a senior Pentagon official, Elaine McCusker, a deputy under secretary of defense who oversees spending.
On August 20, Mr. Duffey wrote to Ms. McCusker to notify her that the aid freeze was going to be extended again, long past the deadline when the Pentagon had said it needed the hold to be lifted if it was going to be able to spend all of the money before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
"It is our intent to add the following footnote to the Ukraine apportionment this afternoon to take effect immediately," Mr. Duffey said in his email to Ms. McCusker, explaining the technical process the White House was using to impose the aid freeze.
"Mike," Ms. McCusker wrote back several hours later, to Mr. Duffey and other senior officials at the Office of Management and Budget. "Seems like we continue to talk (email) past each other a bit. We should probably have a call."
William S. Castle, the principal deputy general counsel at the Pentagon, got involved in the debate, reaching out to the budget office's top lawyer at Ms. McCusker's request to question him on the hold. Mark Paoletta, the general counsel at the budget office, sent a lengthy response.
But other than about a dozen words -- the greeting and the closing of the email -- the entire contents of the response were blacked out before being released under the Freedom of Information Act suit.
"Hi Scott," the email said, followed by four large blacked out areas of text that the White House declined to make public. "Please let me know if you have any questions, Thanks."
The White House cited a provision of the Freedom of Information that allows the federal government to withhold "deliberative communications, the disclosure of which would inhibit the frank and candid exchange of views that is necessary for effective government decision-making."
The emails from July 25 -- the same morning Mr. Trump had his phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and asked him to look into issues related to the 2016 election in the United States and to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden -- show that administration aides were preparing to carry out Mr. Trump's order for the aid freeze.
Mr. Trump had first raised the issue in June, after he learned the Defense Department was about to release $ 250 million of military assistance to Ukraine. But it was not until July 25 that the money that had been allocated for the Pentagon was formally frozen, using a legal provision called an apportionment.
"Did GC send the footnote?" Mr. Duffey wrote at 9 a.m. on July 25, just as the call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky was getting underway, referring to the agency's general counsel and a footnote that would be applied to the apportionment document to freeze the funding.
"Mike, here's the OGC-approved, revised footnote," Mark Sandy, a career official at the budget office, wrote back to his boss, in response to the question, that same morning.
About 90 minutes after Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Duffey told the Pentagon to keep quiet about the aid freeze because of the "sensitive nature of the request," according to a message released last month by the Defense Department.
The emails released to American Oversight, as well as Center for Public Integrity and details about correspondence shared with The New York Times, have led Democrats in Congress to push the White House to release copies of all these exchanges, without the redactions. The Senate voted repeatedly on Tuesday night to block proposals by Democrats to require the release of these documents.

Texto completo: The president signaled a willingness to scale back Medicare, a shift from his 2016 platform of protecting entitlement programs.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump suggested on Wednesday that he would be willing to consider cuts to social safety-net programs like Medicare to reduce the federal deficit if he wins a second term, an apparent shift from his 2016 campaign promise to protect funding for such entitlements.
The president made the comments on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Despite promises to reduce the federal budget deficit, it has ballooned under Mr. Trump's watch as a result of sweeping tax cuts and additional government spending.
Asked in an interview with CNBC if cuts to entitlements would ever be on his plate, Mr. Trump answered yes.
"At some point they will be," Mr. Trump said, before pointing to United States economic growth. "At the right time, we will take a look at that."
Mr. Trump suggested that curbing spending on Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly, was a possibility.
"We're going to look," he said.
The interview left many questions unanswered, including whether Mr. Trump would consider touching Social Security or what part of Medicare he would be willing to shave. The president veered from answering the question about entitlements to talking about the robustness of the American economy and how his policies have helped alleviate poverty and boost jobs for minorities, perhaps suggesting that the need for entitlement programs at their current levels had waned.
The president has already proposed cuts for some safety-net programs. His last budget proposal called for a total of $ 1.9 trillion in cost savings from mandatory safety-net programs, like Medicaid and Medicare. It also called for spending $ 26 billion less on Social Security programs, the federal retirement program, including a $ 10 billion cut to the Social Security Disability Insurance program, which provides benefits to disabled workers.
Spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is expected to cost the federal government more than $ 30 trillion through 2029, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Trump's willingness to consider such cuts marks a shift from four years ago, when he stood out in a field of deficit-minded Republicans in the 2016 primary race with a promise to shield entitlements from cuts.
In a tweet in May 2015, a month before he formally began his campaign, Mr. Trump discussed another Republican's promises to keep entitlements intact, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.
"Huckabee is a nice guy but will never be able to bring in the funds so as not to cut Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid," Mr. Trump tweeted. "I will."
In his formal campaign announcement that year, he said, "Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it."
Democrats are also wrangling over entitlement programs, which are among the fastest growing federal expense. Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been arguing for days over Mr. Biden's past comments about cuts to Social Security, a reminder of how sensitive the issue is for voters.
Republicans have largely avoided talking about rolling back entitlement programs since Mr. Trump became president, assuming that doing so would be a non-starter. Following the $ 1.5 trillion tax cut that Republicans passed in 2017, some suggested that they would quickly turn to reduce the cost of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
Those ideas gained little traction and federal spending has continued to grow.
The Treasury Department said last week that the federal budget deficit surpassed $ 1 trillion in 2019. It was the first calendar year since 2012 that the deficit topped that threshold. To help finance deficits, which require the government to sell debt, the Treasury Department plans to begin issuing 20-year bonds.
Other Trump administration officials have been more careful in discussing the need to cut spending on entitlement programs. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin demurred earlier this month when pressed on CNBC about how to scale back spending on entitlements.
"All I'm going to say is that we talked about there needs to be bipartisan review of government spending and that's something at the appropriate time we'll look at," Mr. Mnuchin said.

Texto completo: An architect of the C.I.A. interrogation program testified that to persuade his superiors to let him stop torturing a captive, he had them stand in the cell and watch.
This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
GUANTÁNAMO BAY, Cuba -- After a few weeks of waterboarding the captive in August 2002, the C.I.A. contract psychologists who had developed the interrogation program wanted to stop. The prisoner, a Palestinian known as Abu Zubaydah, was cooperating, and there did not seem to be any point in continuing to torture him.
But senior intelligence officials wanted them to press on, one of the psychologists, James E. Mitchell, testified to the military tribunal at Guantánamo on Wednesday.
"Please continue with the aggressive interrogation strategy for the next 2-3 weeks," their C.I.A. supervisors cabled them, even after the psychologists had sought permission several times to stop using the waterboard and had sent their bosses a disturbingly graphic video montage of what they had been doing.
Dr. Mitchell said those directing the operation derided the psychologists as "pussies" and believed that, contrary to reports from the secret C.I.A. prison in Thailand where they were carrying out the interrogation, Mr. Zubaydah could yield some information about what they feared were looming terrorist attacks. If they would not continue, their supervisors threatened to replace them with someone more aggressive.
So with the support of the C.I.A. station chief, Dr. Mitchell and his partner in developing the program, John Bruce Jessen, summoned a delegation from headquarters to the site to see a real-life version of what had been antiseptically portrayed on television. He quoted himself as saying, "They should bring their rubber boots and come on down."
The agency dispatched a debriefer from Alec Station, the division that was hunting for Osama bin Laden, and a senior lawyer from the C.I.A.'s Counterterrorism Center.
Dr. Mitchell, describing the incident for the first time in court, said his thinking at the time was: "If you think you want us to waterboard him, then you're going to witness it. We're going to do it one more time and then never again."
In his account in court on Wednesday, he omitted any description of what Mr. Zubaydah was experiencing as guards, the visitors and other black site workers crammed inside his musty, sweaty-smelling cell to watch the waterboarding.
"I don't want to use the word 'perfunctory' about something that horrible," Dr. Mitchell said, describing how he held a cloth over the Palestinian prisoner's face as Dr. Jessen did two "20-second pours," gave the prisoner time to catch his breath, poured water on his face for shorter durations and then concluded with a final, "40-second pour."
Seven months later, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen waterboarded Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who allegedly led the Sept. 11, 2001, hijacking plot, 183 times. But Dr. Mitchell, testifying on the second day of two weeks of hearings centered on the C.I.A. torture program, described essentially putting on a show for visiting senior intelligence officials from C.I.A. headquarters to get permission to stop waterboarding Mr. Zubaydah, whom he and his partner waterboarded a total of 63 times.
Defense lawyers in the Sept. 11 death-penalty case called Dr. Mitchell as the first eyewitness of what went on in the C.I.A. interrogation and detention program in the years before Mr. Mohammed and his co-defendants were transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006 for trial.
During his testimony, Dr. Mitchell pantomimed pouring water, as though from a pitcher. Twenty-five feet away, Mr. Mohammed, on trial for his alleged role in planning the Sept. 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people, had headphones on and appeared to be watching a video on a laptop.
"Some of the folks who were watching were tearful," Dr. Mitchell said in describing the reaction among the visitors who came to see Mr. Zubaydah's interrogation, including "people who had been there all along who didn't want to see him waterboarded again. I was tearful. I cry at dog food commercials, and it was particularly hard for me to do."
"I felt sorry for him," Dr. Mitchell said of Mr. Zubaydah. "I thought it was unnecessary. He had agreed to work for us," and aside from the occasional deception, he said, "he held up his end of the bargain."
In April 2002, as C.I.A. contract psychologists, Drs. Mitchell and Jessen designed a program of violence, sleep deprivation and isolation specifically for use on Mr. Zubaydah. The C.I.A. euphemistically called them "enhanced interrogation techniques."
Both psychologists were Air Force veterans and drew from experience at the military training program called SERE -- for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape -- that subjected United States forces to simulated torture to prepare them for possible capture.
They began waterboarding Mr. Zubaydah in early August. Later that month, Dr. Mitchell testified, they had concluded that they wanted to stop because he was cooperating with his captors and divulging Qaeda secrets.
It was later disclosed that the C.I.A. had mistakenly profiled Mr. Zubaydah as a senior Qaeda official. In fact, he knew some fellow jihadists from Pakistan and Afghanistan and had aspired to set up a rival "terror cell," Dr. Mitchell testified, but had not yet done so. He has never been charged with a crime and is held at Guantánamo as an indefinite detainee.
Through the day, Dr. Mitchell portrayed himself as a sometime whistle-blower who tried to prevent full-time C.I.A. interrogators from doing gratuitously cruel things in the black sites.
He dispassionately described watching an interrogation of the Saudi man now charged in the U.S.S. Cole bombing case, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, that involved a "stress position": Guards put a broomstick behind the captive's knees and bent his torso backward, "pushing his shoulder blades to the floor."
"He was screaming, and I thought he would dislocate his knees," said Dr. Mitchell, who said he reported the mistreatment internally. He added that he did not use stress positions in his interrogations because they "don't lend themselves very well to the kind of classical conditioning I was interested in."

Texto completo: Scroll through the Facebook page of Craig Kelly, a conservative politician, and you'll see why the country has not taken strong action on global warming.
SUTHERLAND, Australia -- Throughout Australia's devastating fire season, one Facebook page has rallied an angry public like no other, with more shares and comments than anything coming from the prime minister or the country's largest environmental groups.
That page belongs to Craig Kelly -- a former furniture salesman who has spent a decade in Parliament setting himself up as the climate-change denier in chief.
Now, in Australia's dark hour, Mr. Kelly has found his moment.
As the country fears it is being condemned to a fiery future by heat and drought, Mr. Kelly has been gathering and goading a right-wing tribe under the banner of posts that shout in all caps: "Bushfires have nothing to do with 'climate change"' or "Beware of climate alarmists: Everything they tell you is a lie."
Mr. Kelly, 56, insists that he is just trying to protect everyday Australians from higher energy prices and lost jobs in coal and other industries.
But with posts and comments on his Facebook page that cherry-pick data and encourage violence against environmentalists, he has emerged as the public face of a parallel universe -- the potent force that helps keep the government, despite the wishes of a broad majority of Australians, from taking stronger action on climate change.
For other politicians, this is a time to show sympathy for the fire victims and promise help.
Mr. Kelly prefers pugilism. He argues that the fires are no worse than in the past, that arsonists and socialists are to blame for the blazes, that coal is winning, that Arctic ice is not melting -- and that those who disagree are no better than the censors in Orwell's "1984."
"It's all rather nefarious," said Michael E. Mann, an American climate scientist on sabbatical in Australia, who was once a target of climate denialists. "The loyal soldiers of the fossil fuel industry like Kelly promote the talking points and incite a rabble."
Many Australians, even climate scientists, dismiss Mr. Kelly as a political Falstaff, outrageous if powerless. But his following has grown to include a wide swath of the country, including rural firefighters who share his Facebook posts, and his efforts have frequently aligned with Prime Minister Scott Morrison's attempts to steer people away from viewing the fires as a turning point for the nation's approach on climate issues.
Before Mr. Morrison started emphasizing that the best way to fight future fires would be through more preventive burning rather than serious action on global warming, Mr. Kelly was hammering the point. He blamed "green madness" and "climate alarmists" -- a term used by President Trump this week in Davos, Switzerland -- for exaggerating the role of climate change and preventing the defensive burns, even though fire officials have said the problem is resources and time, not politics.
Echoing Mr. Kelly's argument that cutting Australia's greenhouse gas emissions will not prevent fires, the prime minister has also moved straight on to rebuilding and recovery rather than addressing the public's concerns about the warming climate.
"It's a very cynical strategy based on the idea that the fires will end, the drought will be broken and people will move on," said John Hewson, a former leader of the center-right Liberal Party, to which Mr. Morrison and Mr. Kelly belong. The prime minister, he added, "is trying to be seen to be doing a lot, but he's actually doing very little."
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Morrison, who serve in adjoining districts with lots of churches, small apartments and workers in the trades, have each other to thank for where they are. Mr. Kelly and other right-wing lawmakers toppled Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in a 2018 party coup, making Mr. Morrison the new leader. Mr. Morrison then overruled the party's preference for a moderate alternative to Mr. Kelly, protecting his candidacy.
It wasn't just Mr. Morrison. Mr. Turnbull and another prime minister, Tony Abbott, previously also pushed aside moderate challengers to ensure that Mr. Kelly returned to Parliament -- a sign of his usefulness to leaders in rallying their conservative base.
"He's the tail wagging the dog," said Tom Kristensen, an artist, climate activist and volunteer firefighter in Mr. Kelly's district who has closely tracked his Facebook posts. "He's part of a tiny minority that has too much power."
Australia's conservative media outlets, dominated by Rupert Murdoch, have helped. In 2012, two years after Mr. Kelly was first elected, he drew a flood of media attention after joining Mr. Abbott, another climate denialist who would soon become prime minister, in opposing a plan to put a price on carbon emissions, describing it as a "poisonous, toxic tax." In 2013, he joined Alan Jones, a notorious conservative radio host, for a "wind power fraud rally" in front of Parliament.
Since then, Mr. Kelly has made regular appearances on Mr. Jones's radio show, as well as on the Murdoch-owned Sky News, where he appeared on Tuesday night to talk climate.
"It's just political opportunism at its worst," Mr. Hewson said. "Sky, which is running its own anti-climate agenda, has been using him as a show pony. They can feed him lines and get him to say things."
Mr. Kelly has at times gone too far even for his own party. Early this month, he brought his views on the fires to an interview on British television with Piers Morgan, the conservative commentator, who was so appalled that he called Mr. Kelly "disgraceful."
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
In response, some members of Mr. Morrison's cabinet tried to distance themselves from Mr. Kelly. David Littleproud, the minister for the drought, dismissed Mr. Kelly as a "sideshow" who "doesn't represent the views of the government."
(Critics have noted that Mr. Littleproud had only recently questioned whether climate change was being caused by human activity.)
After the debacle, Mr. Morrison called for a moratorium in his party on interviews with the international news media.
Nevertheless, Mr. Kelly embraced a lengthy interview with The New York Times, after announcing, "I have to be careful because the prime minister told us not to talk to international media."
Over the phone, Mr. Kelly argued that his enemies had called him a denier to make him sound like a Holocaust denier. Mr. Kelly, who has no college degree and no scientific expertise, said he agreed that temperatures had been rising since the 1970s, but added that the human contribution was "up for debate." (Scientists say this is not in dispute.)
He also insisted that the drought fueling this season's fires was unrelated to climate change (though there is evidence that warming temperatures have been a major contributor, in part by pushing rainfall farther south). And he said that these fires were bad, but not that bad.
"People have forgotten our past -- that we have had bushfires equivalent to this," he said.
The reality is that this season's fires are unique for several reasons. They have covered a geographic spread beyond the fires of the past, in a year without the El Niño conditions that usually accompany the country's worst fire seasons. And they began as Australia endured its hottest, driest year on record.
Several months after the blazes started, scorching subtropical rainforest in September, they have burned 16 million acres, destroyed more than 2,000 homes and killed at least 29 people.
Those numbers are hard to find on Mr. Kelly's Facebook page.
"Craig Kelly is an excellent example of a scientifically illiterate person with a public platform," said Joëlle Gergis, a leading climate scientist and writer at the Australian National University.
"His opinions are ignorant and harmful," she added, "because they confuse people rather than educate."

Texto completo: A moderate Republican congressman from Illinois, he forged a compromise on two articles of impeachment that passed the House Judiciary Committee in 1974.
Tom Railsback, an eight-term Illinois congressman who forged what he called a "fragile bipartisan coalition" between his fellow Republicans and the Democratic majority on the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 to draft articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon, died on Monday in Mesa, Ariz. He was 87.
His death, in a nursing home there, was confirmed by former Representative Raymond H. LaHood, another moderate Republican, who was Mr. Railsback's protégé and served as secretary of transportation in the Obama administration.
On July 27, 1974, the judiciary committee voted 27 to 11, with 6 of the panel's 17 Republicans joining all 21 Democrats, to send to the full House an article of impeachment. The article accused the president of unlawful tactics that constituted a "course of conduct or plan" to obstruct the investigation of the break-in at the offices of the Democratic opposition in the Watergate complex in Washington by a White House team of burglars.
"Railsback and Walter Flowers, a Democrat, basically created the coalition that was necessary to make the House Judiciary Committee vote a bipartisan one," Michael Koncewicz, the author of "They Said No to Nixon: Republicans Who Stood Up to the President's Abuses of Power" (2018), wrote in an email.
"Several moderates and conservatives met in Railsback's office that summer to make sure that there was an article of impeachment that they could vote for," Mr. Koncewicz, a historian at New York University, said. "Their work not only gave the vote credibility, but it also arguably made Nixon's conviction more likely in the Senate."
Rather than face impeachment and a trial in the Senate, Nixon resigned in August 1974.
Mr. Railsback had been conflicted for months. He was loyal to Nixon, a friend whose support had helped him get elected to the House for the first time in 1966.
"In my opinion Richard Nixon has done many wonderful things for his country," Mr. Railsback said on the House floor, close to tears. "I wish the president could do something to absolve himself."
But Mr. Railsback said he was also committed to the Constitution, which, he explained later, the president appeared to have violated by withholding evidence from Congress and, even more, by implicating himself in a cover-up in conversations recorded on White House tapes, which the courts had ordered the administration to release.
"If the Congress doesn't get the material we think we need and then votes to exonerate," he said, "we'll be regarded as a paper tiger."
Mr. Railsback also helped draft a second article of impeachment, charging the president with abusing his authority. But he balked when Democrats proposed further articles citing allegations concerning Mr. Nixon's tax returns and his covert bombing of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.
Add those, he warned, "and you watch what's going to happen to your fragile bipartisan coalition."
After voting for the two impeachment articles in the committee, Mr. Railsback said, "I don't feel very good about it."
His pivotal votes provoked vitriolic reactions from some constituents. ("Tom Railsback, as of this moment, is a dead duck," The Journal Star of Peoria proclaimed.) But he received a standing ovation from a local chamber of commerce, and he was re-elected to four more terms.
His name, along with those of a few other Republicans who voted with him, was invoked by Democrats in the fall as a profile in courage during the House debate over impeaching President Trump. No Republican members voted for impeachment.
"Where's our Bill Cohen? Where's our Hamilton Fish? Where's our Tom Railsback?" Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, asked in an interview.
But in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 2012, Mr. Railsback had said bipartisanship began to evaporate shortly after Watergate.
"When I was elected as a Republican to Congress in 1966 and assigned to the House Judiciary Committee, I was impressed at how nonpartisan it was," he wrote.
A turning point, he recalled, was the Democratic landslide in the midterm elections of 1974.
"The influx of a group of young, brash anti-Nixon Democrats created an atmosphere of division and unease," he wrote. "The climate today in Congress appears even more fractured."
Thomas Fisher Railsback was born on Jan. 22, 1932, in Moline, Ill., to Fred and Elizabeth (Johnson) Railsback. His father was a municipal lawyer.
Tom Railsback received a bachelor's degree from Grinnell College in Iowa in 1954, graduated from Northwestern University School of Law in 1957 and served in the Army from 1957 to 1959.
His marriage to Patricia Sloan in 1955 ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Joyelyn (Silver) Railsback; four daughters from his first marriage, Kathy, Maggie and Lisa Railsback and Julie Hilden; and 19 grandchildren.
Mr. Railsback served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1962 to 1966, when he was elected to Congress, defeating Gale Schisler, a freshman Democrat. In Washington, he was instrumental in drawing up juvenile justice legislation.
After his Western Illinois district was remapped, he lost a Republican primary in 1982 to a more conservative rival, State Senator Kenneth G. McMillan, who himself was defeated that November by the Democratic nominee, Lane Evans.
After leaving Congress, Mr. Railsback became a lobbyist, including as executive vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America and Washington coordinator for the Federal Judges Association.

Texto completo: A revival of the Charles Randolph-Wright play, with Leslie Uggams, had been slated to open on Broadway.
"Blue," a jazz- and soul-inflected play written by Charles Randolph-Wright, with music by Nona Hendryx and lyrics by both creators, will head to the Apollo Theater in Harlem later this year. Phylicia Rashad, who starred in the premiere in 2000, will direct.
The new production was originally slated for Broadway, but was unable to secure a theater there. (Competition for Broadway theaters has been particularly fierce in recent years, as business has boomed; overall grosses from the 2018-2019 season broke records for the sixth year in a row.) "Blue" will have a sixteen-week run at the Apollo -- unusually long for the theater, which is in the midst of an expansion of both its physical spaces and its programming.
"This is part of our strategic growth process," the Apollo's executive producer, Kamilah Forbes, said in a phone interview. Forbes said that the theater plans to host more long-running shows in the future.
The cast of the "Blue" revival will include the Tony Award-winning actress and singer Leslie Uggams (who is on the Apollo's board of directors) and the Emmy Award-winning actress Lynn Whitfield. It is being produced by Brian Moreland, Ron Simons, Eric Falkenstein, Mike Jackson and the singer-songwriter John Legend. The design team members have numerous Broadway credits.
Set in the late 1970s, "Blue" explores issues of class through the story of a wealthy family that owns a funeral parlor in a fictional South Carolina town. The revival casts Whitfield as the matriarch, Peggy; Uggams will play her mother-in-law.
"Blue" debuted at Arena Stage in Washington in 2000. A review in The New York Times of the show's New York run the following year, praised Hendryx's "lush and melodic" songs. "Even if 'Blue' isn't a play that sends you out thinking," the reviewer, Bruce Weber, wrote, "you might leave whistling."
The new production will begin previews on April 27, with a formal opening night set for May 10. It will run through Aug. 16.

Trump to Be First President to Speak at March for Life

Texto completo: The first in-person presidential appearance at the annual event in its 47-year history is President Trump's latest gesture of support for a cause dear to his evangelical base.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump plans to address an annual rally of anti-abortion demonstrators on Friday in Washington, in what would be the first appearance by a sitting president at the March for Life, one of the movement's marquee events.
Mr. Trump's surprise announcement, made on Twitter on Wednesday as the Senate began hearing opening arguments in his impeachment trial, is his latest gesture of support for a cause dear to evangelical Christians who are a core part of his conservative base.
No president has personally attended the march in its 47-year history. Past Republican presidents might have been inclined to attend, but either on the advice of staff or their own instincts saw it as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways, like through remote messages or by meeting with activists.
Mr. Trump, who once called himself "very pro-choice," has until now addressed the group only remotely and welcomed some marchers at the White House.
But as he has battled for political survival in the face of multiple investigations and a re-election campaign, he has made increasingly warm overtures to evangelicals and sought to cast himself as the most firmly anti-abortion president in at least a generation.
His administration has already embraced the march, which draws thousands of attendees, in unprecedented ways. In 2017, Mike Pence became the first sitting vice president to attend the event, and the next year, Mr. Trump became the first president to address the rally by video. In his speech, the president vowed that his administration would "always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life."
Many of the evangelical Christians who most strongly oppose abortion find Mr. Trump's two divorces, penchant for profanity and lack of demonstrated interest in religion before he entered politics to be unsettling. But as a political bloc, they have stood by him loyally as he hands them long-sought judicial appointments and policy changes.
In a statement, Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, praised the president for appointing anti-abortion judges, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions in the United States and abroad, and outspokenly opposing late-term abortions.
"President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life," she said, "and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering."
Mr. Trump's announcement comes a few days after the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political action group, announced that it would spend $ 52 million to support the president and other Republican candidates in the 2020 election cycle, a sum the group called a record.
The group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, a former chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign's Pro-Life Coalition, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's attendance at the March for Life "signals a watershed moment for the pro-life movement."
The March for Life, which has its headquarters in downtown Washington, says its mission is to "promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion -- uniting, educating, and mobilizing pro-life people in the public square."
On Twitter, Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called the president's announcement "a desperate attempt to divert attention from his criminal presidency and fire up his radical base."
Writing in the conservative news outlet The Daily Wire on Wednesday, Russell T. Vought, Mr. Trump's acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, called him "the most pro-life president in history" and celebrated what he called "a golden chapter for our movement."

This 'Typical 3-Year-Old' Was Invited to Join Mensa

Texto completo: Muhammad Haryz Nadzim became the youngest current Mensa member after scoring 142 on an I.Q. test. Above 145 is considered "genius or near genius."
LONDON -- He reads fluently (while wearing a Gruffalo costume), he does math with ease and he can explain scientific concepts such as how rain forms.
He is also 3 years old.
The toddler, Muhammad Haryz Nadzim, was invited last week to join Mensa, a British society whose membership rules require an I.Q. in the top 2 percent of the population.
Haryz, as his family calls him, received an invitation to the society after meeting with a consultant psychologist who assigned him a score of 142 using the Stanford-Binet intelligence test. Scoring above 145 is considered "genius or near genius," according to the test's website.
The 3-year-old is now Mensa's youngest current member, the society said in an email on Wednesday. The youngest-ever member was age 2 years 4 months at the time of joining.
Haryz's mother, Nur Anira Asyikin, said on Instagram, "My mini brainbox just got invited at his little age to be part of Mensa," and congratulated her "very very clever" son.
Mensa was formed in Oxford, England, in 1946 by Roland Berrill, an Australian lawyer, and Lance Ware, a scientist and lawyer. It has more than 110,000 members across the world.
Meeting the membership criteria usually means taking an I.Q. test supervised by the society. For children under age 10 and a half, Mensa says on its website, an assessment by an educational psychologist must be made. That report is then submitted as evidence to support membership, as happened in the case of Haryz.
Ms. Asyikin could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, but she said in a CNN report that her son was "very much your typical 3-year-old," adding that he particularly enjoyed playing with modeling clay and toy bricks. Ms. Asyikin is an engineer and the family lives in Durham, in northeastern England, according to CNN.
An Instagram page dedicated to Haryz's exploits includes a video of the youngster reading books, including "The Gruffalo," by Julia Donaldson, singing nursery rhymes, and -- just before his second birthday -- recounting the story of the Gingerbread Man.
In a video posted on his Instagram profile on Tuesday, Haryz does simple mathematics: "Two plus six equals eight," he tells the camera, drawing numbers and symbols in the air.
Ann Clarkson, a Mensa spokeswoman, said in an email on Wednesday that a high I.Q. was "like a toolbox -- it gives children the equipment to learn, but they still have to put in the effort and practice to become expert at something."
Though all children are unique, she said, what makes Haryz different is "his ability to learn very quickly and process information fast."
Child prodigies have long caused admiration and interest. Alma Deutscher, from Austria, was composing piano melodies at age 4 and played Carnegie Hall in New York in December at age 14. In Belgium, Laurent Simons, a 9-year-old, was on course last year to become one of the youngest people in the world to graduate from a university.
But the pressure that comes with such gifts can take a toll in the long term.
Saul Chandler, a former violin prodigy who played Carnegie Hall twice before age 13 and suffered a nervous breakdown by 16, told The New York Times in 2018, then age 70, that if he could forget music, he would.
"They turned me into a trained monkey," he said, adding that he would not want to be remembered for his childhood achievements. "Because I ended up doing a lot of other great things in my life, too."
Despite her obvious delight in Haryz's talents, Ms. Asyikin hinted at the pressures in an Instagram post.
Whatever her son went on to achieve, she wrote, "we will always be proud of you."

Texto completo: The justices heard arguments on a Montana scholarship program struck down by the state's Supreme Court.
WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Wednesday seemed poised to rule that states may not exclude religious schools from state programs that provide scholarships to students attending private schools.
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., looking none the worse for wear after a late night presiding over the impeachment trial of President Trump, seemed to be searching for a limiting principle, one that would allow the scholarships but stop short of requiring state support for religious education in other contexts.
"I wonder," the chief justice said, "if there's a difference between general funding of the public schools and the decision to provide aid to private schools, except not religious schools."
Justice Stephen G. Breyer, a member of the court's liberal wing, asked questions along the same lines.
Jeffrey B. Wall, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in favor of the scholarship program, offered a limiting principle that seemed to respond to their concerns: If state aid is made available to private schools, religious ones may not be excluded. But government spending on public schools, he added, does not require aid to private schools, religious or not.
The case involves a Montana program enacted in 2015 "to provide parental and student choice in education." The program was financed by private contributions eligible for tax credits, and it provided scholarships to students in private schools.
In Montana, that meant religious schools: 12 of the 13 schools that participated in the program were religious, and one was a school for children with disabilities. In one year, 94 percent of the scholarships went to religious schools.
Soon after the program started, a state agency said students attending religious schools were not eligible in light of a provision of the state's Constitution that bars the use of government money for "any sectarian purpose or to aid any church, school, academy, seminary, college, university or other literary or scientific institution, controlled in whole or in part by any church, sect or denomination."
Three mothers with children at Stillwater Christian School, in Kalispell, Mont., sued, saying that provision of the state Constitution violated the protections of religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.
The Montana Supreme Court ruled against them, shutting down the entire program for all schools, religious or not.
Richard D. Komer, a lawyer with the Institute for Justice, which represents the plaintiffs, said the question for the justices was straightforward. "This case asks whether the federal Constitution allows the wholesale exclusion of religious schools from scholarship programs," he said. "It does not."
In 2017, in Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, the Supreme Court ruled that Missouri had violated the First Amendment by barring religious institutions from a state program to make playgrounds safer, even though the state's Constitution called for strict separation of church and state.
"The exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution," Chief Justice Roberts wrote for the majority.
At the same time, writing for four justices, Chief Justice Roberts emphasized the narrowness of the court's decision. "This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing," he wrote. "We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination."
Mr. Wall said the Trinity Lutheran decision should require the court to sustain the Montana program. Justice Elena Kagan responded that the two cases presented different issues.
Noting that she had been in the majority in Trinity Lutheran, Justice Kagan said it was one thing to exclude religious institutions from "a completely secular public benefit" and another "to subsidize religious education."
Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed, saying the two cases were in important ways identical.
"They don't have to fund private education at all," he said of states, "but if they choose to provide scholarships that are available to students who attend private schools, they can't discriminate against parents who want to send their children to schools that are affiliated in some way with a church."
"That's the simple argument," Justice Alito said. "And it's hard to see that that's much different from Trinity Lutheran."
Many state constitutions include restrictions on government aid to religious groups. The provisions, often called Blaine amendments, were initially adopted in the 19th century and often had the goal of restricting funding for Catholic schools.
Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the amendments were "rooted in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics."
Adam G. Unikowsky, a lawyer for the state, acknowledged elements of that history, calling it complicated, but said Montana's constitutional provision was readopted in 1972. "I don't think there's any evidence whatsoever of any anti-religious bigotry," he said of Montana's current approach.
A 2004 Supreme Court decision, Locke v. Davey, allowed Washington State to offer college scholarships to all students except those pursuing degrees in devotional theology. That case involved direct support for religion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote in the Trinity Lutheran case. Playgrounds, he argued, were a different matter.
The current case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, No. 18-1195, includes a curious element that several justices focused on. The Montana Supreme Court struck down the entire program, and so it was not obvious that it discriminated against religious groups.
"I am having trouble seeing where the harm in this case is at this point," Justice Kagan said. "There is no discrimination at this point going on."
But Mr. Wall, the lawyer for the federal government, said the Montana Supreme Court had violated the federal Constitution in striking down the program. It should not matter, he said, that the parents of students attending secular private schools had sustained "collateral damage."
Justice Alito agreed. "It is a violation of the federal Constitution," he said, "if a state Supreme Court bases a decision on a ground that discriminates in violation of the Constitution.

Texto completo: The Minnesota Lynx star said she does not plan to retire yet, but the case of Jonathan Irons, a man she believes was wrongfully convicted, has consumed her.
Maya Moore, the W.N.B.A. star regarded as one of the greats of the sport, will sit out for a second straight season and remove herself from contention for the Olympics so she can continue to push for criminal justice reform and the release of Jonathan Irons, a man she believes is innocent of the crime for which he was sentenced to prison.
"I'm in a really good place right now with my life, and I don't want to change anything," Moore, an eight-year Minnesota Lynx forward, told The New York Times in a telephone interview this week from her home in Atlanta. "Basketball has not been foremost in my mind. I've been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I've been able to be there for Jonathan."
Irons, now 39, whom she met in 2007 during a visit to the Jefferson City Correctional Center in Missouri, is serving a 50-year sentence after being convicted of burglary and assaulting a homeowner with a gun. Born into severe poverty, Irons was 16 when the incident occurred in a St. Louis suburb.
The homeowner, who was shot in the head during the assault, testified that Irons was the perpetrator, but there were no corroborating witnesses, fingerprints, footprints, DNA or blood evidence to connect Irons to the crime. Prosecutors said Irons admitted to a police officer that he broke into the victim's home, a claim Irons and his lawyers have steadfastly denied. The officer had interrogated Irons alone and did not record the conversation.
Irons, who is African-American, was tried as an adult and found guilty by an all-white jury.
Moore shocked women's basketball last winter by announcing that she was taking a season off to support Irons as he appealed his conviction. Only 29 years old at the time and still in her prime, she left the door open for a return to the Olympics this summer in Tokyo and the W.N.B.A., where she has led the Lynx to four championships since her rookie season in 2011.
Moore said she was fatigued by the grinding year-round schedule that top female basketball players endure to supplement a W.N.B.A. salary of roughly $ 120,000 a season -- about one quarter of what LeBron James makes in a single regular-season game. (A new labor agreement will boost W.N.B.A. salaries and benefits in coming years.) Moore tried to maximize her earnings by playing in leagues around the globe throughout the year with little rest. Including the Olympics, she had rarely had time away from competition since her teens.
Now, her decision to take a second year off is a blow to women's basketball. Moore's haul of Olympic gold medals from the 2012 and 2016 Summer Games, W.N.B.A. titles and her leadership of two undefeated championship teams at the University of Connecticut qualify her as one of the greatest winners that basketball has ever known. She also has a charisma that has endeared her to fans and corporate sponsors.
Her absence will affect more than the marketing of the women's game.
The Lynx, who have lost in the first round of the playoffs the past two years, could use her leadership. So could the Olympic team, which was stunned by the University of Oregon in a November exhibition loss.
"We are going to miss Maya tremendously, but we also respect her decision," said Carol Callan, director of the United States national team. "A player of Maya's ability does not walk away from the gym lightly. Everyone feels it. The thing that makes her so special is her approach, her dedication, which has always been contagious for our team."
The Lynx released a statement Wednesday expressing support for Moore's decision to stay away from basketball. "Over the last year we have been in frequent contact with Maya around the great work in criminal justice reform and ministry in which she is fully engaged," said Cheryl Reeve, the team's coach and general manager. "We are proud of the ways that Maya is advocating for justice and using her platform to impact social change."
Asked during an interview this week if she would ever play again, Moore paused to consider her response. "I don't feel like this is the right time for me to retire," she said. "Retirement is something that is a big deal and there is a right way to do it well, and this is not the time for me."
Nonetheless, she added: "I have had such a unique experience in the game. I got to experience the best of my craft, and I did that multiple times. There is nothing more I wish I could experience."
Moore's family had come to know Irons through a prison ministry. He and Moore have become close friends, although she did not speak about their sibling-like bond until after 2016, when she began advocating criminal justice reform after a series of police shootings of unarmed black men and the killing of five law enforcement officers by a sniper in Dallas.
Moore, an evangelical Christian, spent much of her first year away from basketball ministering in Atlanta and spending time with her family. She spoke on panels and was interviewed multiple times on national television about Irons and changes she would like to see in the justice system, particularly in how it treats minorities and the poor.
She traveled often to her hometown Jefferson City, Mo., to confer with Irons and his defense team, which she has helped pay for. Moore and her family also attended a series of courtroom hearings as Judge Daniel Green considered Irons's appeal.
In October, despite protests from state prosecutors, who argued that Irons's case should not be reviewed, Green heard nearly six hours of testimony. Moore watched as Irons took the witness stand in shackles to state his innocence and face cross-examination -- something a public defender had kept him from doing at his original trial, citing his youth and lack of education.
Asked about the case this week, a spokesman for the Missouri Attorney General's Office declined to comment.
Additional court appearances are likely in the coming months, including a hearing next week, as Green considers new expert testimony and reviews the results of a test he ordered fingerprints discovered at the crime scene that match neither Irons nor the homeowner.
In a profile published by The Times in June, Moore expressed optimism that Irons's conviction could be overturned. Now, Moore believes passionately that Irons will be freed.
"We just have to keep being patient," she said. "And keep having faith."

Texto completo: Beijing has responded faster to the new threat than it did with SARS, but it still silences and punishes those who veer from the official line, with potentially damaging consequences.
The SARS disaster was supposed to drag China into a new era of openness and responsibility. The deadly disease rippled across the world 17 years ago, abetted by a Chinese government that covered up its spread. As the scope of it became clear, China's journalists, intellectuals and other critics helped shame Beijing into opening up about the problem.
"SARS has been our country's 9/11," said Xu Zhiyuan, then a young newspaper columnist and a fierce critic of the government's handling of SARS, in a 2003 interview with The New York Times. "It has forced us to pay attention to the real meaning of globalization."
Today, China faces the spread of another mysterious disease, a coronavirus, which so far has killed 17 people and infected more than 570. And while Beijing's response has improved in some ways, it has regressed in others. It is censoring criticism. It is detaining people for spreading what it calls "rumors." It is suppressing information it deems alarming.
Though China's censors are busily scrubbing the Chinese internet, the country's online community is registering its disappointment and alarm over Beijing's handling of the new virus that has spread since December from the city of Wuhan to other countries, even the United States.
"I thought SARS would force China to rethink its governance model," Mr. Xu, now a video talk show host, wrote on social media on Tuesday, also posting a screenshot of his 2003 quote in The Times. "I was too naïve."
In many ways, China has changed for the better since the SARS epidemic. Its economy has grown eightfold. It has built more skyscrapers, subways and high-speed rail lines than any other country. Its tech companies rival Silicon Valley's giants. A more responsive bureaucracy provides more people with health care, social services and even quality-of-life improvements like parks.
When it comes to handling diseases, the public health system has greatly improved. Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, is also home to one of the most advanced epidemic disease research laboratories in the world.
Those improvements have come at a price. The government has tightened its grip on the internet, the media and civil society. It has deeper pockets and a greater ability to control the flow of information across the country.
As a result, many of the media outlets, advocacy groups, activists and others who held the government accountable in 2003 have been silenced or sidelined.
"The system is successful in that it destroyed the people with integrity, the institutions with credibility and a society capable of narrating its own stories," Mr. Xu said on social media. "What's left is an arrogant power, a bunch of messy information and many fragile, isolated and angry individuals."
Even as the new virus spread through Wuhan, the government took pains to keep up appearances.
The first case was reported Dec. 8. As the disease spread, Wuhan officials insisted that it was controlled and treatable. The police questioned eight people who posted on social media about the virus, saying they had spread "rumors."
On Saturday, two days before Wuhan told the world about the severity of the outbreak, it hosted a potluck banquet attended by more than 40,000 families so the city could apply for a world record for most dishes served at an event. On the day it broke the news to the world, it also announced that it was distributing 200,000 free tickets to residents for festival activities during the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins this Saturday.
The central government backed Wuhan's officials. Wang Guangfa, a prominent government respiratory expert, told the state broadcaster China Central Television on Jan. 10 that the Wuhan pneumonia was "under control" and mostly a "mild condition." Eleven days later, he confirmed to Chinese media that he might have contracted the virus himself during an inspection in Wuhan.
Recognizing an outbreak can take time, and China is not the first government caught flat footed by a disease.
But the choices made by government officials had an impact on a major commercial and transportation hub. Wuhan is a city of 11 million people, including nearly one million college students from across the country. By the time it disclosed the seriousness of the outbreak, the 40-day Lunar New Year travel season, when Chinese people take an estimated three billion trips combined, had already begun.
People might have made different decisions had websites and headlines described growing worries. Instead, they traveled. On Tuesday, all five confirmed cases in Beijing were people who had traveled to Wuhan in January for business, study or leisure.
Until a week ago, some people in China called it the "patriotic virus." Cases appeared in Hong Kong, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan and elsewhere in Asia. No other Chinese city but Wuhan reported infection cases. It was not until the Hong Kong news media reported over the weekend that the virus had been found in other cities did officials elsewhere come forward.
Some critics see parallels to SARS. In 2003, the Guangzhou newspaper Southern Metropolis Daily first reported the SARS outbreak. A military doctor, Jiang Yanyong, came forward with what he knew. Only then did officials act.
"The way this virus came into the public view is the same as that of SARS 17 years ago," said Rose Luqiu, an assistant journalism professor who covered SARS as a reporter for the Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television.
Many of those brave voices in 2003 are gone. Like almost all Chinese media outlets that were active in the 1990s and 2000s, the Southern Metropolis Daily has lost its freedom to pursue coverage that holds local governments, if not Beijing, accountable. Only a few mainland news media outlets are covering the current crisis critically, and then only with an analytical tone.
In 2003, Phoenix Television called Ms. Luqiu, then a star reporter, back from Iraq to report on SARS in Beijing. She shadowed the newly appointed Beijing mayor, Wang Qishan, for a week to cover how the government dealt with the crisis. Mr. Wang later became the vice president of China.
That kind of openness is unimaginable now. Last week, when a group of Hong Kong journalists went to the Wuhan hospital that took in most coronavirus patients, the police detained them for a few hours. They were asked to delete their TV footage and hand in their phones and cameras for inspection.
On Tuesday, Ms. Luqiu wrote an article for qq.com, the news site owned by the internet giant Tencent, about the measures the Hong Kong government has taken in dealing with the virus. The article was deleted 10 hours later.
Dr. Jiang, the military doctor who became a whistle-blower in 2003, has been put under periodic house arrest and forbidden to visit the United States to collect a human rights award. He is also portrayed as a bad role model. A multiple-choice question posed by a test-prep school in 2017 asked about Dr. Jiang's decision. The correct answer was B: It was wrong because it harmed the interests of the nation, the society and the community and should be subject to legal punishment.
China's disclosures have improved in many ways since SARS. The government admitted the problem faster. Beijing officials have shown determination to be more transparent. A top party committee said on Tuesday that it would not tolerate any efforts to hide infections.
"Whoever deliberately delays or conceals reporting for the sake of their own interests will be forever nailed to history's pillar of shame," the committee said in a post on WeChat. The post was later deleted.
But when the government is the only source of information, wise advice and valuable clues can be lost. A police bureau in eastern Shandong Province posted on the Twitter-like social media platform Weibo on Wednesday that it had detained four residents who spread rumors that there was a suspected coronavirus patient in the district. In that environment, others dare not speak out.
"The authorities are sending a signal, which is that only the government agencies can talk about the epidemic," Yu Ping, a former Southern Metropolis Daily reporter, wrote on his personal blog. "All other people should just shut up."
"It's not public disclosure," Mr. Yu added. "It's a naked information monopoly."

Let's analyze Donald Trump's reelection chances

Texto completo: With the impeachment trial moving forward and the Iowa caucuses around the corner, it's never the wrong time to analyze Donald Trump's reelection chances. If you care about unseating him, it doesn't help to underestimate him, or his appeal.
Just ask Hillary Clinton.
Steve Bannon has told anyone who will listen that he won the 2016 election for Trump by hammering home three issues: immigration, the economy, and disentanglement from foreign wars. If those worked four years ago, there is no reason why they won't work a second time.
Trump attracts plenty of ridicule for his promise-mongering about the “wall" with Mexico, but the unbuilt wall can do the same job in 2020 as the hypothetical wall did in 2016 — e.g., “Reelect me, I have to finish what Nancy Pelosi prevented me from doing, blah blah blah."
Trump's, harsh, cruelty-first immigration policies haven't won him many friends in the commentariat, or in states where immigration and asylum issues aren't integrally connected to the local economy, i.e. Massachusetts. But he will run on his record.
A Trump ad aired last fall claims “he has cut illegal immigration in half" — an exaggeration, to put it mildly. Yet The Washington Post recently reported that “the number of migrants taken into custody along the US-Mexico border has started to plateau after several straight months of decline."
He grasped the nettle, as he promised to do.
Nobel Prize winners are never going to praise Trumponomics (Paul Krugman on Election Day, 2016: “Markets are plunging"), but in a presidential campaign, three pocketbook issues matter: (1) Is inflation under control? (2) Is gasoline more expensive? and (3) Do I have a job?
The election is several months away, but for now the answers for most Americans are Yes, No, and Yes. Advantage Trump.
Concerning foreign entanglements, Trump's foreign policy can be politely described as incoherent. American troop deployments overseas have either declined or remained steady, depending on whom you choose to believe. When Trump was elected, my greatest fear was that he would provoke a war on the Korean peninsula. That hasn't happened, which either exposes my poor judgment or means that Trump has acted with more restraint than I thought he would.
Trumpismo spawned a spate of wheezy “Death of Democracy" articles in “thought leader" publications, e.g. The Atlantic's “How America Ends" or The New York Times's “How Democracy Dies." What a charade. Trump loves democracy! American democracy has provided him with a tricked-out Boeing 747 that he can fly down to Florida to play golf, any day he wants. Not just on weekends.
Democracy is grand!
Further proof that Trump loves democracy: He has injected himself into several closely contested state elections since he became president. (Louisiana, Kentucky, and Alabama come to mind.) With mixed results, to be sure. But there is no reason think he won't contest this next election, and vigorously. It'll be worth it just to keep flying his Golf Shuttle, formerly known as Air Force One.
Ah, I hear you say, but people despise Donald Trump. That is true. In one poll, 69 percent of the respondents said they dislike Trump's admittedly loathsome personality. But the Trump campaign has that angle covered: “He's no Mr. Nice Guy," an ad that ran during the 2019 World Series declared, “but sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington."
It's easy to write off Trump as a psychiatric basket case, or an Adolf Hitler wannabe. The truth is much starker: He is a formidable candidate for reelection to the presidency of the United States.

Texto completo: SOCCER Struggles continuefor Manchester United Ole Gunnar Solskjaer knows how badly he is doing at Manchester United. However, the manager can't seem to find any solutions.
'When you're at Man United there's always going to be criticism,' Solskjaer said after a 2-0 loss to Burnley on Wednesday. 'We can't do anything but hold our hands up and say, 'This isn't good enough for this club.' '
United's first loss to Burnley at Old Trafford since 1962 came on the back of Sunday's defeat at Liverpool and left the club in fifth place, six points from the Champions League places.
Tottenham moved level on points with United after ending a four-match winless run in the Premier League with a 2-1 victory over Norwich.
Leicester beat West Ham, 4-1, to reboot its push to return to the Champions League after four years following back-to-back losses. . . .
With Lionel Messi resting and Luis Suárez out injured, it was Antoine Griezmann who had to come through to save Barcelona from an embarrassing elimination in the Copa del Rey.
Griezmann scored two late goals as Barcelona came from behind to beat third-division club Ibiza, 2-1, in the competition's round of 32.
Also, Real Madrid won, 3-1, against Unionistas de Salamanca " another third-division team " with Gareth Bale scoring his first goal for the club since September.
Griezmann scored in the 72nd minute and in stoppage time after the hosts had taken the lead less than 10 minutes into the match played on artificial turf in the Balearic Islands. . . .
Neymar was involved in all three goals as Paris Saint-Germain cruised past Reims, 3-0, to set up a French League Cup final against Lyon.
PRO BASKETBALL Minnesota Lynx star Maya Moore will sit out a second consecutive WNBA season and has taken herself out of consideration for the Olympics so she can push for the prison release of a Missouri man who she believes is innocent, she told the New York Times.
That man, 39-year-old Jonathan Irons , is serving a 50-year prison sentence for a conviction of burglary and assault of a man in his home with a weapon. Moore first met Irons in 2017 when she visited the Jefferson City Correctional Center, where he is an inmate.
Moore, 30, told the newspaper that she is not retired, despite her decision to sit out a second straight WNBA season. Moore was the first overall pick in the 2011 draft. With Moore, the Lynx went to the WNBA Finals six times.
BASEBALL The St. Louis Cardinals signed catcher Matt Wieters to a contract for the 2020 season, bringing back the 33-year-old veteran to fill the same role behind Yadier Molina as he did this past season.
Wieters was a four-time all-star with Baltimore before spending two seasons with Washington and then joining the Cardinals. He was a nonroster invitee who wound up starting 54 games and appearing in 67 in 2019, hitting .214 with 11 homers and 27-RBI while helping St. Louis win the NL Central. . . .
The Kansas City Royals signed veteran outfielder Alex Gordon to a $4 million contract for next season. . . .
The Philadelphia Phillies signed former Nationals closer Drew Storen , left-hander Francisco Liriano , right-hander Bud Norris and infielder Neil Walker to minor league contracts with invitations to attend major league spring training.
MISC. The NCAA will now permit elite athletes to be paid for training expenses by the U.S. Olympic Committee and other national governing bodies.
The Division I Council adopted the legislation at the NCAA convention in Anaheim, Calif., and it is effective immediately.
Previously, college athletes could compromise their eligibility to compete for their schools by accepting some benefits provided to potential Olympians. . . .
Czech veteran Michal Brezina took a surprise lead at the European Figure Skating Championships in Graz, Austria, and Kevin Aymoz of France failed to qualify for the free skate.
Brezina scored 89.77 points in his short program to take the lead, seven years after he won the only major championship medal of his career with bronze at the European championships.
Aymoz had been a favorite for gold after winning bronze at the Grand Prix Finals in December as the top-ranked European skater.
However, he fell twice and missed another jump element, scoring 64.40 points for 26th place.

Senate tries to keep you in the dark

Texto completo: Reporters penned off, unable to roam the Senate halls freely. No press photography or recording devices within the chamber. A (nearly) single-focus view of the historic proceedings " offered only by government video cameras, with not even C-SPAN allowed in to jazz things up.
It's the ultimate contradiction: The Senate impeachment trial of the media-obsessed president is a remarkably bloodless TV spectacle.
There can be little doubt that these restrictive rules are the brainchild-of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has declared himself firmly on the side of President Trump.
And they have an end in mind: Make the trial seem as boring and pallid as possible.-
'We are not able to see what is the emotion, what is the state of consciousness of the members of the Senate,' Fox News analyst Chris Wallace commented during a Tuesday broadcast.
To their credit, journalists and news organizations found-ways around the restrictions and did their jobs anyway.
The New York Times, among others, sent a sketch artist to capture images,-including a senator nodding off only a few hours in.-
Punditry continued apace on cable and broadcast news " analysts held forth, lawyers parsed the arguments. Nothing can stem that tide of talking heads.
And innumerable stories got written or broadcast, perhaps with less color than they might have had otherwise, but getting the facts across effectively.
But that doesn't make the restrictions any more right, as Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) complained in a letter to the Senate-sergeant at arms: 'To place limitations on the press is to place limitations on the American people's ability to learn about the character and conduct of their elected leaders.'
Security concerns are-said to be behind all of this " a lame argument given that these credentialed reporters go-through security checks whenever they enter the Capitol complex.
And it's hard to understand why more camera angles pose a threat to safety.
No, this isn't about security at all. It's about trying to keep at bay a sense of historic importance. It's about trying to weary and stultify the American public into not caring about what's happening.
Ever helpful to the Trumpian cause, Steve Doocy made that case Wednesday morning on 'Fox - Friends':-'It was unbelievably boring. I don't know how people can follow it.'
Having the proceedings continue well into the evening hours is another part of the same effort to dull the senses, to file the edges off what could hardly be-more significant.
Yet for those watching closely " those who were still tuned in to-cable-after 9 p.m., long after the networks had resumed their prime-time programming " Tuesday's proceedings offered worthwhile moments, ones that didn't need special camera angles to succeed.
Take the 'mic drop moment' by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) who picked up on the mocking question by Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow in his opening-statement: 'Why are we here?'
'We are here, sir, because President Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political and personal gain,'-Jeffries said. 'We are here, sir, because President Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election and corrupted our democracy.'-
And, he added, we are here to 'follow the facts, apply the law, be guided by the Constitution and present the truth to the American people.'
He concluded, 'That is why we are here, Mr. Sekulow.' Then he delivered a line, one also familiar to 'Hamilton' fans, from late rapper Notorious B.I.G.: 'And if you don't know, now you know.'-
Conservative columnist Quin Hillyer of the Washington Examiner called the Jeffries speech a 'tour de force.'
Those who had stuck with the first day's proceedings up to that point-" or who had tuned in to take a peek " couldn't have declared themselves bored.-
It wasn't the only memorable or effective moment. In particular, the video flashbacks of testimony made by diplomats and White House officials " used in House managers' exhibits " were effective reminders of what's at stake. (On Twitter, Susan Glasser of the New Yorker noted, with a touch of sarcasm, that these were exclusively devices used by Democrats: 'The President's legal team forgot to bring their slides to the Senate trial. They don't have video clips for senators to look at either.')
As the trial begins in earnest, there's plenty of reason to stay involved and stay focused.
The American public may not be delighted or riveted by the trial, but they're unavoidably aware " as has been made clear in recent public opinion polls that show more Americans support removing Trump from office than approve of him.
And although removal is extremely-unlikely, Americans will remember at least some of what they've seen and heard.
That, to most Senate Republicans and President Trump, is quite a vexing problem.
And it's one that can't be solved by artless camera angles or reporters kept behind ropes.

Will a woman be president in 2020?

Texto completo: Headnote Commentary
(TriceEdneyWire.com)-In a most unusual endorsement, the New York Times has endorsed both Senators Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Mn.) for the Democratic nomination for President. Apparently, the Editorial Board of the Times disagrees with Sen. Bemie Sanders (Vt.), who allegedly told Warren that a woman could not win the Presidency. I'd love to see the right woman in the White House, but I've been among the many who have wondered openly if, in a polarized and sexist United States, a woman can win both the nomination and the Presidency.
Though polls are not a definitive measure of who will win an election, Warren and Klobuchar tend to poll more weakly than the men in the race-Vice President Biden, Sanders, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Have we come such a long way since 2016 that a woman is electable? Can so-called progressive men who want to get 45 out of the White House overcome their gender bias to vote for a woman?
Clearly, the Times not only thinks a woman can win, but in endorsing two women for the Democratic nomination, they are saying that women are the best of the Democrats in the race. And, in the past two years, we've seen signs that women are gaining politically. The women's sweep of the 2018 elections certainly bodes well for women. At the same time, is gender a sufficient qualification for the Presidency? Three years after the first flawed but overwhelmingly successful Women's March in 2017, the realignment of the March "movement" has illustrated cracks in the foundations of feminism.
These flaws perhaps go back to the scuffle over who should get the vote first between our nation's first feminists like Elizabeth Cady Stanton and civil rights activists like Frederick Douglass. In resenting the fact that Black men got the vote before White women, those early feminists used extremely disparaging language against Black men, using terms like "savage" to suggest these men did not deserve to vote.
Can anybody say "intersectionality"? Or to make it more clear, use the words of Sojourner Truth and say, "Ain't IA Woman." The women's march movement fell apart because women were not on the same page. Accusations against Tamika Mallory and Linda Sarsour, two of the co-chairs of the March caused much discussion and rancor, so much so that the second Women's March attracted a fraction of the people who showed up to the first one. And the third March was operated on s different model. It did not equal the excitement or momentum of the first March, although there were many more local marches and other activities associated with the marches.
Women can't "come together" unless they acknowledge our differences, as well as our similarities. Thanks to Tarana Burke and folks like Professor Kimberly Crenshaw, some Black women are openly addressing issues of race and class in feminism. But I've heard few White women, either politicians or intellectuals, deal with issues of racism in the women's movement. Is there really "a women's movement"? There are women's issues, and women's marches, and an exhilarating display of anti-Trump sentiment three years ago (don't forget that 53 percent of white women voted for that man), but when do women come together?
In other words, gender is not a qualification for higher office. ¿Vnd if the women endorsed by the New York Times do not fully explore the concept of intersectionality and speak on it, they will likely sideline some votes, even though many others would vote for Búbba the ' Fool to get rid of 45. Both Warren and Klobuchar are exciting candidates. Warren's progressive ideas endear her to the left, and Klobuchar's more moderate approach to social and economic challenges appearls to others. The Times did a good job of contrasting the two women.
But can either win the President? When then one-term Senator Barack Obama ran for President, 1 liked him very much but didn't think a Black man could succeed in this racist nation. Thankfully, I was wrong. Can a woman win in 2020? I'm hoping the best candidate will win, and the best candidate may well be a woman. .

India's citizenship law targets Muslims

Texto completo: Recently the Indian government passed a citizenship law that sparked violent protests in the country and claimed a number of lives. Since India's independence in 1947, it is the first time religion has been made a criterion for Indian citizenship.

The law provides a path to citizenship to members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities who had fled from the neighboring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. It specifically excludes Muslims for such consideration, saying that they should return to Muslim countries.

The Rohingya Muslims were persecuted by the Buddhist majority in Myanmar and forced to flee. A number of them reached India via Bangladesh and will be excluded from citizenship, according to the new law. Myanmar has refused to accept Rohingya back into the country.

Also at risk are Muslims who are unable to provide proof of Indian residency and citizenship irrespective of the length of their stay in India.

The new law and other anti-Muslim policies have to be seen through the prism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ideology.

In 1925 like-minded Hindu nationalists formed Rashtriya Sevek Sangh, a youth organization along the lines of Hitler Youth, a youth organization of the Nazi Party. Mr. Modi played a major role in establishing the branches of RSS throughout India. Later he represented RSS in the national political party Bharatya Janta Party that is commonly known by its initials, BJP.

The RSS as well as the Bharatya Janta Party promote the ideology of Hindutva or Hindu-ness that looks at the Indian culture through the lens of Hindu values. Under Mr. Modi, BJP has openly supported RSS philosophy and has been known to incite violence against minorities in India.

In 2002 when Mr. Modi was chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat, 2,000 Muslims were massacred in a pogrom. While Mr. Modi was not directly implicated in the pogrom, the state police, by allowing Hindu mobs to go after the Muslims, was implicated. Because of Mr. Modi's responsibility as the chief minister, the United States banned him from entering the United States. The ban continued until he emerged as a prime ministerial candidate in 2014.

The backlash against the recent law has been violent and widespread. Western reports indicate that the police were given a free hand to deal with demonstrators. At least 16 people have died and hundreds were injured as a result. Police entered Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi and beat up protesting students. It was repeated at Jamia Millia Islamia, another university in New Delhi.

While a great majority of Mr. Modi's supporters have applauded the new law, a good number of Hindus have spoken against it and have been part of peaceful demonstrations across India. Recently Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of the populous Indian state of West Bengal, led a massive rally in Kolkata.

International reaction has been swift. The European Union, the United States, and many other nations have spoken against the law. In an unprecedented first the scientific journal Nature in an editorial condemned the attacks on university students in Delhi and Aligarh. The editorial quoted Nature's principal scientific adviser, Vijaya Raghaven, taking exception to police intrusion in the university campuses.

The surge of Hindu nationalism has also targeted Mohandas Gandhi, the hero of India's struggle for independence. The Hindu nationalists blame him for appeasing Muslims and ceding to the creation of Pakistan. RSS member Nathuram Godse shot Mahatma Gandhi because he was too friendly to the Muslims. There is a movement within RSS and BJP to rehabilitate Godse as an Indian patriot and hero.

Meanwhile, the Indian diaspora is mostly mute on the law.

In the aftermath of the pogrom in Gujarat, a coalition of Christian evangelists, Jewish leaders, Indian-born activists, and Republican members of the U.S. Congress successfully opposed the issuance of a visa to Mr. Modi.

In contrast, very few diaspora Hindus have spoken openly against the citizen law or the incendiary rhetoric used by Mr. Modi and some leaders of BJP. Last September 50,000 Indians attended a Modi love fest in Houston.

A recent editorial in the New York Times summarizes the real intent of the law: The law, as India's 200 million Muslims have correctly surmised, has nothing to do with helping migrants and everything to do with the campaign by Mr. Modi and his home minister, Amit Shah, to marginalize Muslims and turn India into a homeland for Hindus, who comprise about 80 percent of the population of 1.3 billion.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A divided Senate began the impeachment trial of President Trump on Tuesday in utter acrimony, as Republicans refused to commit to hearing from witnesses Democrats demanded and moderate Republicans forced last-minute changes to rules that had been tailored to the president's wishes.
The debate, convened just after 1 p.m. in a Senate chamber transformed for the occasion, marked the substantive beginning of the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. It was the culmination of weeks of rhetorical sparring between the two parties over whether and when to call witnesses and new evidence that Trump blocked from House investigators.
Standing in the well of the Senate, the Democratic House impeachment managers pleaded with senators, who were sworn to silence, to reject proposed rules from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would delay a debate over witnesses and documents until the middle of the trial, with no guarantee that they would ever be called.
The question of calling new evidence, said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the lead manager, was an “even more important question than how you vote on guilt or innocence."
“If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents, the opening statements will be the end of the trial," he said. “To say let's just have the opening statements and then we'll see means let's have the trial, and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug."
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, offered the first of several amendments to the rules — a proposal to issue a subpoena to the White House for “all documents, communications, and other records" relating to the Ukraine matter.
It was rejected on a party-line vote. A second amendment, to subpoena documents from the State Department, was also rejected by the same vote, demonstrating that Republicans are in firm control of their 53-47 majority in the chamber.
But the issue of witnesses is expected to resurface later in the trial, after opening arguments and a question period, when the rules allow votes on whether and whom to subpoena.
At the heart of the trial are charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against the president approved last month nearly along party lines by the Democratic-led House. They assert that Trump used the power of his office to enlist a foreign power for help in the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals while withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House meeting for its president, and then stonewalled congressional attempts to investigate.
Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and amount to criminalizing a president's prerogative to make foreign policy decisions as he sees fit and to shield from Congress documents relating to the conduct of his duties. They also claim — in a break with most constitutional scholars — that because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law, Trump cannot be impeached.
But on Tuesday, the debate focused on whether his trial would be fair or not.
“This initial step will offer an early signal to our country: Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?" McConnell said.
But under pressure from Republican moderates, McConnell made some last-minute changes to the set of rules he unveiled on Monday, which would have squeezed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days and refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry into evidence without a separate vote later in the trial.
Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio, among others, objected to those proposals, which were a departure from procedures adopted unanimously by the Senate for the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton, on which McConnell had promised to model his rules. At a luncheon with Republican senators in the Capitol just before the trial was to begin, Collins and Portman raised their objections privately, according to aides familiar with the conversation, and McConnell submitted a revised copy of the resolution — with lines crossed out and changes scrawled in the margins — when it was time for the debate.
When his resolution was read aloud on the Senate floor, two days had been extended to three and the House's records would be automatically admitted into evidence, although McConnell inserted a provision not included in the 1999 rules that would allow Trump's team to move to throw out parts of the House case.
The historically rare debate was rendered even more unusual by Senate rules that prohibit senators from speaking on the chamber floor for the duration of the proceedings and empower the House managers and White House defense lawyers to argue aloud over the proposals instead. The effect was that on the trial's first day, the Senate chamber split cleanly into partisan factions, with the managers siding with Senate Democrats and Trump's lawyers taking the place of the Republicans.
Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, rose first and addressed the senators, urging them to support McConnell's proposed rules, which he called “a fair way to proceed" and getting in a jab at House Democrats' delay in transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
“We believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the president has done nothing wrong," Cipollone said, “and that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution."
Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, opened for the prosecution saying America's Founders added the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution with “precisely this type of conduct in mind — conduct that abuses the power of office for a personal benefit, that undermines our national security, and that invites foreign interference in the democratic process of an election."
Said Schiff: "It is the trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment.''
The other lead lawyer on Trump's team, Jay Sekulow, retorted, “I'll give you a trifecta," outlining complaints over the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry process.
Locked in silence, senators were able to speak only before the proceeding began or during brief breaks.
“It is completely partisan. It was kept secret until the eve of the trial," Schumer told reporters Tuesday morning. “The McConnell rules seem to have been designed by President Trump and for President Trump, simply executed by Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans."
Specifically, he sought votes on records housed at the White House, State Department and Defense Department, and to compel testimony from four current and former Trump administration officials who were blocked from speaking with the House: John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert Blair, an adviser to Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a White House budget official.

Texto completo: Black folk have a real dilemma building up over the 2020 elections like thunderclouds over the Midwestern plains.
There is no question that we need to resist the re-election of Donald Trump with every fiber of our beings. Allowing this most horrible of humans another four years to try to destroy every hard-fought gain won over the past 70 years will pose an extremely dangerous threat to lives and our liberty. Without question, Trump most go.
The question then becomes, "After Trump, then what?"
Some people suggest that we replace Trump with Joe Biden. After all, they argue, he was Obama's vice president. But the problem with that reasoning is that Joe Biden is Joe Biden, not Barack Obama. Biden created so many problems for the African American community during his political career that should disqualify him from serious consideration by Black voters.
During the 1970s, Biden was chums with segregationists, opposed busing to integrate schools and voted to bar the use of federal funding for abortions. In the 1990s, his treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas hearings was abhorrent, and he drafted the 1994 crime bill that has resulted in the United States having the highest incarceration rate in the world.
Biden wants us to believe that his days of racially toxic behavior are behind him, but the words that come out of his mouth are evidence that he is still a danger to African Americans.
During one of the presidential debates in September, Biden claimed one reason for the achievement gap between white and Black students is the so called "word gap" between them. This notion of a word gap is a discredited theory based on a flawed 1995 study claiming that poor children hear 30 million fewer words than their middle-class counterparts during the early years of life. He suggested that the achievement gap can be fixed if Black parents "make sure the record player is on at night" so their "kids hear words."
The 30-million-word gap theory rose to prominence during the 1980s due to inappropriate testing and research. It also appears that research was underpinned with implicit racism. This theory was clearly debunked by 2018 using more efficient testing and research and a contextual approach to the issue. As early as 1972, experts were exposing flaws in the word gap theory. In a June 1972 Atlantic article titled "Academic Ignorance and Black Intelligence," linguist William Labov wrote: "Our work in the speech community makes it painfully obvious that in many ways working-class speakers are more effective narrators, reasoners, and debaters than many middle-class speakers..."
Labov went on to say about the word gap:
"Unfortunately, these notions are based upon the work of educational psychologists who know very little about language and even less about black children. The concept of verbal deprivation has no basis in social reality; in fact, black children in the urban ghettos receive a great deal of verbal stimulation, hear more well-formed sentences than middle-class children, and participate fully in a highly verbal culture; they have the same basic vocabulary, possess the same capacity for conceptual learning, and use the same logic as anyone else who learns to speak and understand English."
Forty-seven years after Lebov's Atlantic article, Biden still does not have a clue.
When questioned about these outdated beliefs during a New York Times editorial board interview in December, Biden attempted to support his position by claiming that Black parents are reluctant to participate in the education of their children because of their embarrassment over the lack of their own education and their inability to speak well.
In 2012, the Survey Research Institute at the University of Houston conducted interviews of 1,200 individuals and concluded that African Americans are the most likely demographic to value postsecondary education.
Apparently, it did not occur to Biden that racism and disparities in resources have a hand in the achievement gap. But he wants a job where he will decide how the nation's resources will be used to overcome the effects of racism. Would there be a danger of our tax dollars would be spent to distribute voice recordings because of a debunked and racist theory? We need a president who has a better understanding, not only of the causes of racially motivated educational disparities, but all the disparities in this country caused by bigotry and ignorance.
The problem we as Black folk are facing with the 2020 election is to figure out who we want to replace Donald Trump. Trump is a cancer on democracy. But can't we do better than Joe Biden?

'Dangerously in Love' Beyonce and Jay-Z are Hollywood's Most Powerful Couple

Texto completo: When Beyonce married Jay-Z in 2008, the skeptics were as loud as the audience at a sold-out Destiny's Child concert.
At its worst, critics expected that the marriage would be Bobby and Whitney all over again - a hip-hop bad boy meets a sexy songstress with a squeaky-clean, all-American image.
Some of those critics believed the marriage would only last as long as the union between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley - an odd and uncomfortable 20-month marriage that ended with Elvis' daughter filing for divorce citing irreconcilable differences.
After a dozen years, hundreds of millions of records sold - and one infamous elevator fight at a Met Gala between Jay-Z and Solange Knowles, (Beyonce's little sister) - Hollywood's preeminent power couple are still "dangerously in love."
"I believe Beyonce and Jay-Z have been successfully married as a Hollywood power couple for so long because they can see beyond the wealth, fame and materialism that comes with a Hollywood lifestyle," stated hip-hop artist and activist Sean XGL Mitchell.
"The music business can be brutal so artists and couples who are grounded, in touch with reality and are consciously aware of who they are, have the keys to success and longevity," Mitchell noted.
"In particular, when you watched Beyonce's Super Bowl performance a few years ago, she paid tribute to the Black Panthers while performing her new hit' Formation. Their costumes and choreographed dance routine, which included a fist in the air, was a true sign of self-knowledge and pride," Mitchell added.
"It was equally apparent in Jay-Z's lyrics in the song the 'Story of O.J.' When you have two people who are more than just artists, who can transcend power, you have the making of a successful partnership and marriage," he said.
According to medium.com, the average divorce rate of Hollywood celebrities is 52 percent, slightly higher than that of the general public. The length of celebrity marriages can be as short as hours, while the average is about six years, the website reported.
That Jay-Z and Beyonce have doubled that time and are still going strong, doesn't exactly surprise experts who've followed their careers and relationship.
Dr. Fran Walfish, a Beverly Hills family and relationship psychotherapist and regular expert child psychologist on CBS-TV's "The Doctors," said it's no secret the power couple has overcome big problems in their marriage.
At a Met Gala event in 2014, cameras caught Solange hitting and kicking Jay-Z as Beyonce watched quietly. Later, it was revealed that Solange confronted her brother-in-law over cheating rumors, and things quickly escalated.
"The critical key is that they hung in together with a solemn commitment to each other and the couple ship," Walfish stated. "Today, it seems, they are doing better than ever and are parents to a 7-year-old daughter and two-year-old twins."
In a 2017 interview with The New York Times Style Magazine, Jay-Z opened up about his infidelity and the near demise of his marriage.
"You know, most people walk away, and like the divorce rate is 50 percent or something because most people can't see themselves," Jay-Z told the Times. "The hardest thing is seeing pain on someone's face that you caused, and then have to deal with yourself. So, most people don't want to do that. You don't want to look inside yourself. And so, you walk away."
Walfish stated that Jay-Z's interview with the Times was telling.
"The hardest part for him was seeing the pain on his wife, that he caused," Walfish said.
"That is accountability and owning up to a huge mistake. Beyonce, on the other hand, had to be open to forgiveness. Her love and non-judgmental character, along with probable therapeutic help, allowed for repair in the relationship. The secondary gain is that this type of relationship deep repair can bond a couple even more strongly together than before," Walfish added.
Born Sean Carter in Brooklyn, NY in 1969, Jay-Z has won 22 Grammy Awards with hits that include "Hard Knock Life," "99 Problems," and "Run this Town."
With a net worth of more than $1 billion, Jay-Z also has produced several films, and he owns the streaming service, Tidal, and other companies.
Born in 1981 in Houston, Texas, Beyonce rose to fame with the singing group "Destiny's Child" in the 1990s. Her solo career took off in 2002 with the release of the album, "Dangerously in Love," which included a collaboration with Jay-Z.
Beyonce has won 23 Grammy Awards and owns and operates Parkwood Entertainment, a company that includes various brands of music, movies, videos, and fashion. Forbes Magazine has placed Beyonce's net worth at approximately $500 million.
"These two powerhouse moguls understand the nature of engagement that is vital in a marriage," stated Dr. Allana Da Graca, a psychologist, and self-styled persistence expert.
"I think they both understand the arduous journey to fame that can also blur lifelines of meaning and authenticity amongst themselves. They hold one another accountable and maintain the muse of each other," Da Graca said.

Thomas Edsall elicits nuanced insights into the core belief systems of liberals and conservatives

Texto completo: What kind of deep-down qualities and values tend to separate liberals and conservatives?
New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall (who, as usual, relies more heavily on scholars to delve into such issues than the usual pundits and politicians) takes a deep dive into that question in his weekly New York Times column, and the insights blew me away, including this one, from one of the many scholars included in the piece:
“It is likely that rather less liberal democracy will ultimately make liberal democracy more secure.”
The rise of Donald Trump, on a platform that included plenty of racism and nativism, led Edsall to pursue, with academics far removed from the more oft-quoted pundits on whom political reporters usually rely, this question:
“What if the belief systems used to justify anti-immigrant policies and to justify race prejudice, for that matter — hostility to outsiders, insularity, high sensitivity to external threat — are as deeply ingrained in the American body politic as belief systems sympathetic to immigration and to racial equality — openness, receptivity to new experiences, trust?”
The answers he obtained were more nuanced than we hear from the usual talking heads on TV. I’ll just give you one taste and then urge you to read the whole thing. Wrote Edsall:
Karen Stenner, a political psychologist and behavioral economist best known for “predicting the rise of Trump-like figures under the kinds of conditions we now confront,” responded to my emailed inquiries by noting the conflicting pressures at play:
“I don’t think I would agree that Trumpian conservative stands on immigration, race and homelessness are a more ‘natural’ or ‘default’ position. Communities with a good balance of people who seek out diversity, complexity, novelty, new and exciting experiences etc., and those who are disgusted by and averse to such things, avoid them, and tell others to do likewise, tend to thrive and prosper in human evolution.”
Finding the right balance, Stenner said, “is vital to both societal cohesion and human flourishing.” But, she warned, “we may have tipped the balance too far in favor of unconstrained diversity and complexity,” pushing the boundary beyond “many people’s capacity to tolerate it.”
At this juncture, she argued, we need to tinker with that balance and get it right for everyone. So there’s the paradox of our times: it is likely that rather less liberal democracy will ultimately make liberal democracy more secure.

Texto completo: The bad boy of Florida's Republican Party is back, with another fascinating read on politics... although this one could also be characterized as a self-help book for Democrats running in the 2020 Presidential Primary. Rick Wilson, author of "Running Against the Devil," is hoping his newest book will be seen as a strategic plan for pushing back against the current Republican presidential campaign machine.
"The thing that has surprised me the most is how many Democrats have been receptive to the book," Wilson told me. "It's been a shock to me, and kind of a delight."
Florida politicos know Wilson by name and reputation; he's been involved in politics for decades, often serving as a hard-hitting consultant for Republican candidates. His somewhat recent foray into writing has allowed him to come out from behind the curtain, in his own words.
"I appreciate being able to be myself," he said. "I made the decision three years ago to stand by my principles, and ever since then I've had an incredibly positive experience."
He did not, he joked, turn to writing for the money, something his former colleagues sometimes rib him about. But he likes playing the role of teacher and explainer, being able to educate people about the political systems behind the scenes. His first book, "Everything Trump Touches Dies," was more exposé than instruction manual, which he said was successful because he wasn't afraid to be a smart-ass (the book hit No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list). "Running" is more about tough love.
"You want to help them," he mused. "I'm not here to give anyone participation trophies."
One of the greatest challenges Wilson has faced while writing his books is the struggle to keep them current as publishing deadlines loom and events of significance keep unfolding. For example, the vote to begin the impeachment process against the president happened just after "Running" had already been finalized, and Wilson worked hard (and successfully) to include mention of the monumental development in the final version.
"I always wish I could make one more change, one last edit," he said. "But then you have to let it be."
It's advice which, frankly, probably applies to political campaigns as well.

Texto completo: Plans underway for Bob Cousy statue in Worcester
WORCESTER, Mass. -- The management company that operates the DCU Center in Worcester is donating $150,000 to the city to fund a statue of former Boston Celtics great Bob Cousy.
The City Council unanimously approved a resolution Tuesday night accepting the gift from ASM Global/SMG Management, which operates the arena, The Telegram & Gazette reported.
"The city of Worcester is extremely grateful for this generous donation," City Manager Edward Augustus Jr. said.
The exact location of the approximately 7-foot-tall statue, including a granite base, is yet to be determined but the tentative plan is to place it outside the city-owned arena.
The statue will be designed and created by Rotblatt Amrany, who has done life-size bronze statues of several other sports figures including Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neil and Vince Lombardi.
Cousy, 91, is a New York City native but played for Holy Cross in Worcester and has lived in the city most of his adult life. The point guard was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1971.
A statue of Cousy was unveiled on the Holy Cross campus in 2008.Evansville coach McCarty fired amid misconduct allegations
EVANSVILLE, Ind. -- Walter McCarty has been fired as Evansville's coach after an investigation revealed additional allegations of off-court misconduct, the university announced Tuesday.
Former Butler coach Todd Lickliter was hired late Tuesday to replace McCarty, the university announced. Lickliter signed a multi-year contract and will take over immediately. The Purple Aces play Drake Wednesday night and Lickliter will be on the sideline, the university said.
McCarty was placed on administrative leave on Dec. 26 so university officials could investigate allegations of sexual misconduct and violations of the school's Title IX policy.
In a statement announcing the decision, the school said it had received new reports of misconduct with members of the "campus community" during McCarty's tenure of less than two seasons. It also noted that McCarty had previously participated in a training program about unacceptable behavior.
"While the investigation of potential Title IX violations will continue under university policies, UE has decided that, based on the facts uncovered thus far, it is necessary to terminate Mr. McCarty's employment immediately," the school said. "There is no place at UE for any behavior by any university employee or student that jeopardizes the safety and security of others."
McCarty finishes his career at Evansville with a record of 20-25. He played in the NBA with the New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns and Los Angeles Clippers.
Following his playing career, McCarty served as an assistant coach with the Celtics, Pacers and at the University of Louisville before taking the Evansville job.Lynx star Maya Moore opts to stay on hiatus from WNBA in '20
MINNEAPOLIS -- Minnesota Lynx star Maya Moore will sit out a second straight WNBA season to continue her push for criminal justice reform.
Moore told The New York Times in a story published Wednesday of her choice to stay off the court for 2020. She said in her interview with the newspaper that she's not ready to retire. Moore's agent confirmed her decision to The Associated Press.
The 30-year-old, who won the WNBA Most Valuable Player award in 2014 and was a five-time first team All-WNBA selection, also cited fatigue when she first surprised the basketball world last winter by announcing she would step away.
Head coach and general manager Cheryl Reeve said Wednesday in a statement issued by the club that the Lynx have "been in frequent contact" with Moore over the last year and praised her "fully engaged" effort in criminal justice reform and ministry. Reeve did not address Moore's playing status.Big 12 suspends 4 players from KU-KSU brawl 24 games total
LAWRENCE, Kan. -- The Big 12 suspended four players from Kansas and Kansas State a combined 24 games Wednesday for their roles in a melee that spilled off the court and into a section of disabled seating in Allen Fieldhouse near the end of the third-ranked Jayhawks' win over the Wildcats.
Kansas forward Silvio De Sousa, who already was suspended indefinitely by Jayhawks coach Bill Self, was given a 12-game suspension by the league office. His teammate, David McCormack, was suspended two games while Kansas State forward James Love received an eight-game suspension and Antonio Gordon got a three-game suspension.
Both schools also were reprimanded by the Big 12 for violations of its sportsmanship policy.
"This kind of behavior cannot be tolerated and these suspensions reflect the severity of last night's events," Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby said. "I am appreciative of the cooperation of both institutions in resolving this matter."
De Sousa was the main instigator on the Kansas side Tuesday night, getting stripped of the ball as he was dribbling out the final seconds of an 81-60 win. He recovered to block a layup attempt by the Wildcats' DaJuan Gordon, then stood over the freshman in a taunting manner, triggering both benches to empty in a scrum that spilled into fans.
At one point, De Sousa was preparing to swing a stool when it was plucked from his hands, and several players from both teams threw wild punches while a sellout crowd in Allen Fieldhouse watched in shock.
"I have suspended Silvio De Sousa indefinitely pending the final outcome of the review by KU and the Big 12 Conference," Self said shortly after discussing the incident on the league's weekly conference call with reporters. "As I said last night, we are disappointed in his actions and there is no place in the game for that behavior."
Kansas (15-3) has played six conference games, which means De Sousa's suspension from the Big 12 would last through the end of the regular season. The Jayhawks are a half-game back of top-ranked Baylor in the league standings, and they have a team that is capable of making a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
"Obviously an unfortunate situation," said Dan Gavitt, the NCAA vice president for men's basketball. "It's a conference game so it will be up to the Big 12 to determine what actions need to be taken. Other than that, it's too early to say how it might affect them (in the NCAA Tournament)."
Self said he spoke with a fan who was caught up in the melee, and that she was banged around "to the point where I'm sure we'll correspond with her today to see how she's feeling."
"Obviously it's embarrassing," Self said. "It's not something to be proud of."
Games between Kansas and Kansas State are always testy affairs, and for all but the final seconds their meeting at Allen Fieldhouse was rather subdued. The Jayhawks used a 19-2 run midway through the first half to seize control and the outcome was never in doubt the final 30 minutes.
The fight drew comparisons to the brawl between Cincinnati and Xavier in December 2011 that left players bloodied and college basketball fans aghast. Eight players wound up suspended for a total of 30 games.
Kansas State coach Bruce Weber told his players to allow the Jayhawks to dribble out the clock, and he was walking toward the scorer's table to shake hands with Self when the benches emptied. Both coaches eventually joined members of their staff, security officials and even Kansas cheerleaders in trying to separate the players.
"Very, very sad by the event that happened last night," said Weber, adding the school would issue its own punishments soon. "It's sad and disappointing and you know, it leaves a bad picture for everybody. And I've been in this for a long time and you see it happen occasionally and you think you're not going too be part of it and obviously I was part of it -- we were part of it -- and its sad for college basketball, the game that I love and I've been part of basically all my life."
The fracas continued a particularly difficult 12 months for Self and the Jayhawks, and De Sousa has played a big part in most of it. His name surfaced as part of the FBI probe into college basketball in October 2018, and that in part led to an NCAA investigation that resulted in a notice of allegations last September outlining major violations tied to recruiting in men's basketball. Those violations are being appealed and a decision is not expected until later this year.
De Sousa was initially suspended for two seasons for his role in the case -- last season and this season -- and the school spent significant resources appealing the punishment. It eventually was reduced, allowing the junior forward to play this season.

Joe Biden still loved by voters even though media have new darlings

Texto completo: Much has been made this week of the New York Times’s strange decision to endorse two candidates for president. In an exceedingly dramatic Sunday night television special, the newspaper concluded its Bachelor-esque rose ceremony with a dual endorsement of Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. However, it’s unclear if either will actually benefit from the elite paper's backing. If any 2020 candidate will gain traction from the spectacle, it may actually be Joe Biden after his endearing encounter with Jacquelyn, the newspaper’s security guard, went viral. Tweet
The working-class voter gushed over Biden, telling him he’s her “favorite” and that she thinks he is “awesome.” Biden responded in kind. The entire scenario is a reminder that many everyday Americans, especially black voters, still appreciate the former vice president, even if some in the media have new darlings.
Just on Wednesday, CNN’s Sarah Mucha reported that Biden was asked about the encounter in Mason City, Iowa, a small town two hours north of Des Moines. Biden responded, “I think that it’s important, not just for leaders but for everybody, to just treat people with respect. Treat them with dignity.”
Biden’s propensity for big-hearted human gestures isn’t limited to elevator encounters in New York City. In the past few years as a Democratic politician and alumnus of the Obama administration, I’ve heard countless stories from across the nation of times Biden offered a kind word, a sincere note, or a simple act of generosity during times of need.
In my hometown of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, a young woman named Megan recently recounted to me how after her father had died of a similar form of brain cancer that took the life of Biden's son, her grandmother wrote to the vice president to tell him of her son’s death. Biden immediately responded with a letter of his own, offering his prayers to the grieving mother. Megan said her grandmother never forgot it.Tweet
Dr. Robert Leonard had a similar experience earlier this month. The radio host and medical doctor in rural Iowa had just lost his dad over the holidays when he discovered a condolence card in the mail from Joe Biden.Tweet
Biden’s compassion for everyday Americans stands in stark contrast to the attitude of some of his rivals. For example, during the same New York Times television special, there was a peculiar moment when Sen. Bernie Sanders was asked what his biggest weakness was.
Here’s the Vermont Independent’s answer:
"Look: I don’t tolerate bullshit terribly well, and I come from a different background than a lot of other people who run the country. I’m not good at backslapping. I’m not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I’m not going to call you up to congratulate you so you’ll love me and you’ll write nice things about me. That’s not what I do. Never have. I take that as a little bit of a criticism, self-criticism. I have been amazed at how many people respond to, ‘Happy birthday!’ ‘Oh Bernie, thanks so much for calling.’ It works. It’s just not my style."
What Bernie dismisses as "bullshit," many see as the compassion that's crucial to being an effective politician.
As Greek philosophers long ago noted, no one will accept the wisdom of our arguments if they first don’t experience our character and particular care for them. In short, voters cannot trust that you’ll love the invisible many around the nation if you can’t love the single, visible person in front of you.
The politics of personal gesture is a powerful force in American politics. And in fairness, Sanders’s supporters will rightly note that the media sometimes exaggerate the senator’s curmudgeonly caricature and ignore his displays of personal affection with voters.
But here’s what no one can dispute: The pathway to the nomination is going to force every candidate to build close relationships with voters of many different stripes. And from the looks of it, Sanders has still got room to grow if he’s going to become the Democratic Party’s nominee.

Impeachment, Democrats, and those 90,000 documents

Texto completo: For weeks, Democrats have been demanding to see new witnesses and documents for the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Mostly they have emphasized witnesses. But on Tuesday, the first full day of the trial, the Democratic House managers seemed to turn up the call for documents, claiming that President Bill Clinton provided tens of thousands of pages of documents for his impeachment trial in 1999.
"In the Clinton case, the president provided all of the documents -- more than 90,000 pages of them -- before the trial took place," the managers said in a statement released Tuesday morning. "[Majority Leader Mitch] McConnell's resolution rejects that basic necessity."
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed up the managers. "For the Clinton trial, witnesses were deposed and the president provided more than 90,000 documents," she said Tuesday.
"All of the documents in the Clinton trial were turned over prior to the trial," said lead impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff when arguments before the Senate began. "All 90,000 pages of them, so they could be used in the House's case."
So a question: Where did the figure of 90,000 pages, or documents, come from? Did Bill Clinton helpfully cooperate with the House Republicans who were trying to remove him from office 20 years ago?
It turns out Schiff, Pelosi, and their colleagues were not telling the whole story. They got the 90,000 figure, apparently, from Clinton's rebuttal to the Starr report, the report independent counsel Kenneth Starr turned over to Congress on September 9, 1998, after seven months of investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair. In that rebuttal, given to Congress on September 11, Clinton's lawyers wrote: "During the past four and a half years, the President has...produced more than 90,000 pages of documents and other items" to investigators.
But not to Congress. The Clinton situation was entirely different from the one Schiff and his fellow Democrats face today. Starr was an independent counsel, with full law enforcement powers, and his office issued many grand jury subpoenas, pushing Clinton, who often resisted fiercely, to turn over the 90,000 documents over the course of four and a half years, covering the Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate, and Lewinsky probes.
"If memory serves me correctly, I don't think he voluntarily gave us anything," said Sol Weisenberg, a former Starr prosecutor, in a conversation Tuesday.
With Trump, the House has been involved in a different process. Speaker Nancy Pelosi chose not to seek the appointment of a special counsel to investigate the Trump-Ukraine matter. (The old independent counsel law under which Starr was appointed expired years ago; a Trump-Ukraine special counsel investigation might have operated along the lines of the Mueller Trump-Russia investigation.) Instead, House Democrats conducted a hurried investigation that did not involve a grand jury or engage in the type of fighting for documents that Starr did.
The House did issue a subpoena for documents, directed at White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, on October 4, 2019. The subpoena seemed almost certain to stir conflict, calling "for documents and communications that are highly delicate and would typically be subject in almost any White House to claims of executive privilege," according to the New York Times.
The White House declined to provide the documents, arguing that the House impeachment process did not formally exist because the House had not at that point taken a formal vote beginning the process.
And when the White House did not turn over documents, the House did...nothing.
"Did the House take any steps to remedy that?" asked Trump lawyer Patrick Philbin on the Senate floor Tuesday. "Did they try to dispute that? Did they go to court? Did they try to resolve that problem? No. Because as we know, all they wanted to do was issue a subpoena and move on."
Now, Democrats say they really, really want documents. After all, they claim, Bill Clinton turned over those 90,000 documents for his impeachment trial. How could Donald Trump do less? It sounds persuasive -- until one finds out what really happened way back in 1998.

Texto completo: Democrats have a pipe dream: They want a society in which parents, mothers in particular, don't have to make hard choices.
In a New York Times article this weekend headlined "Why mothers' choices often feel like no choice," there's a picture at the top of Elizabeth Warren holding a young couple's baby. Warren, as you're probably aware, wants universal childcare for all families so both parents can work full-time and year-round. After all, Warren's "Aunt Bee" rescued Warren from having to stay home with her young children and wound up staying 16 years. Ergo, it's only right that every family have the same advantage Warren did.
At least, that's Warren's logic.
But are Democrats right when they assume the reason women's earnings stall after they have kids is that they lack the choices Warren had? Or could it be that, Aunt Bee or no Aunt Bee, women would generally choose to stay home with their children in the early years? In other words, would offering mothers free, full-time substitute care for their babies and toddlers in the form of daycare create the desired result Democrats seek? Would women work more and mother less?
No, they wouldn't.
For one thing, most parents know that daycare isn't remotely comparable to having an Aunt Bee — and Warren will never be able to convince them otherwise. Second, a smaller form of this plan (in the form of paid leave) has been tried in California, and it failed. Women didn't want it. Third, most parents know what Warren does not: that the best environment for children in the early years (unless they're extremely poor or disadvantaged in some way) is at home, preferably with mom.
Finally, most parents accept that choices have trade-offs. The real reason women's earnings stall after they have kids is that — hold on to your hat because this may come as a shock — they want to be with their kids. That Warren didn't is her choice. But that doesn't mean that when other women do, it's because they lack choices. They do have a choice: They just made a different one than Warren did. To assume that taking care of their own babies is not what most women want, that they only make this choice when they're forced into a box, suggests women can't think for themselves.
It is true that the majority of mothers work outside the home in some capacity. But it is equally true that when they do, they almost always feel guilty—which isn't a bad thing but is an indicator that something needs to change. Most parents believe children are better off with a parent at home anyway.
Finally, when polled, the vast majority of mothers, 67%, say their "ideal" situation would be to work part-time or not at all. This would all indicate that "high-quality, affordable childcare" (which again, doesn't exist anyway) is not at all what most people are clamoring for.
Warren needs to do her homework. She may find the money she's looking for to pay for free childcare for all — she's proposing an "Ultra-Millionaire Tax" — but what she can't do is make mothers sign up.

Historians say the New York Times gets history and slavery wrong

Texto completo: We live in history-making times, not so much because of the impeachment trial going on in the Senate, which will make history only if it routinizes impeachments of impolite presidents when the opposition party gets control of the House, but because of what looks like an ongoing battle for control of the central narrative of United States history.
That battle was opened back in August when the New York Times ran the first several articles of the 1619 Project. Named for the year when the first African slaves were offloaded in the dozen-year-old colony of Virginia, the series' central theme is that slavery and its effects form the central driving force in U.S. history, underpinning everything from corporate capitalism to suburban sprawl.
The latest salvo on the other side comes from Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, writing in the Atlantic. Wilentz makes mincemeat of the New York Times's Nikole Hannah-Jones’s contention that protecting slavery was a main motive of the American Revolution and also of her statement that President Abraham Lincoln “opposed black equality.” He further debunks her assertion that blacks fought “alone” for equal rights after the Civil War.
Wilentz was also a co-signer of a letter to the New York Times lamenting factual errors in its 1619 articles, along with Brown University’s Gordon Wood, Princeton’s James McPherson, and City University of New York’s James Oakes. “I don’t know of any colonist who said they wanted independence in order to preserve their slaves,” said Wood, a premier historian of the American Revolution, to the World Socialist Web Site, which has taken an interest in the controversy. “No colonist expressed alarm that the mother country was out to abolish slavery in 1776.”
McPherson, the leading scholar on the Civil War, said he was “disturbed by what seemed like a very unbalanced, one-sided account, which lacked context and perspective on the complexity of slavery.” Oakes, a leading historian of Reconstruction, calls the idea that “slavery or racism is built into the DNA of America" one of several “really dangerous tropes. They’re not only ahistorical, they’re actually anti-historical. The function of those tropes is to deny change over time.”
This helps explain why the 1619 Project makes short shrift of black leaders and their white allies who led successful fights to make enormous change. “One of the many odd things about the New York Times’s 1619 Project," notes Steven Hayward, author of the two-volume The Age of Reagan, "is that Martin Luther King is barely mentioned (ditto Frederick Douglass).” Nor is there mention of A. Philip Randolph, organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, or the 1920s Harlem Renaissance.
Wilentz, McPherson, and Oakes aren’t conservative polemicists; Wilentz is a strongly partisan Democrat and supporter of the Trump impeachment. These historians' point is that the 1619 Project is inaccurate in many important respects — on certain facts and, even more so, in the overall lesson it seeks to teach, as the New York Times promotes its use in schools.
As Wilentz told the Atlantic’s Adam Serwer, “To teach children that the American Revolution was fought in part to secure slavery would be giving a fundamental misunderstanding not only of what the American Revolution was all about but what America stood for and has stood for since the founding.” Anti-slavery ideology was a “very new thing in the world in the 18th century; there was more anti-slavery activity in the colonies than in Britain.”
Or, as McPherson explains, every human society has had slavery; the British Atlantic seaboard colonies were among the first to spawn an anti-slavery movement, with several voting to abolish slavery in the first years of the republic.
One peculiar thing about the New York Times’s effort to seize control of the central narrative of U.S. history is that it comes just a few years after voters elected and reelected an African American president. Barack Obama was only the seventh president (and only the third Democrat, after Andrew Jackson and Franklin Roosevelt) to win a majority of the popular vote twice in the 180 years when the popular vote has been the primary means of determining the states' electoral votes.
The election of Donald Trump has been taken by many of his critics, not least at the New York Times, as the election of a racist by a racist country — an irremediably racist country, if you take the view promoted by the 1619 Project. Slavery determines everything and always will. Serious historians criticize the New York Times's inaccuracies because they know that sometimes things can change for the better and that sometimes they have. We should not forget.

Supreme Court has chance to strike bipartisan blow against anti-religious discrimination

Texto completo: On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear a case that has somewhat flown under the radar but has massive implications.
The ruling the court hands down in Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue may establish once and for all whether states should be free to exclude religious organizations from government programs. There’s no reason that both liberal and conservative justices can’t take this opportunity to come together in support of equality for all, religious liberty, and educational freedom.
The case concerns a Montana program granting $150 in tax credits to those who donate to help fund private school tuition scholarships. Single mother Kendra Espinoza sought to use the scholarship program to send her children to a private religious school. A state agency excluded religious schools from the program, citing an archaic “Blaine amendment” in the state constitution that bars taxpayer dollars from going to religious organizations. The Montana Supreme Court upheld this backward decision.
This is foolish. The state has no right to discriminate arbitrarily against religious schools, and it sure seems like a blatant violation of the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which bars government discrimination. As Nicole Russell explained in these pages, the history of Blaine amendments is “steeped in bigotry.”
And no, allowing taxpayer dollars to subsidize education indirectly at a religious school doesn’t violate the “separation of church and state.” In fact, those words appear nowhere in the Constitution. The First Amendment does, of course, bar the government from establishing a formal religion, through the establishment clause. But treating all schools equally by allowing secular and religious organizations alike to participate in the scholarship program in no way would establish a state religion. If anything, the status quo does, by establishing atheism or agnosticism as the state religion.
The conservative majority on the Supreme Court ought to see this.
There’s promising precedent: In a 2017 case, the court ruled 7 to 2 that it was unconstitutional to bar churches from secular government aid programs that subsidized the construction of playgrounds. This was a narrow ruling in scope and did not lay down a marker against government discrimination, but it does provide hope that the justices will remedy the situation definitively this time around.
It's possible that this ruling can be bipartisan. Even the liberal-leaning editorial board of the Washington Post came out in favor of the Espinozas, writing: “That some families choose to use the scholarships at religious schools is their right and, contrary to many of the tropes advanced by those opposed to school choice, doesn’t undermine public education or harm the state.” In taking this stance, the paper is more or less siding with conservative and libertarian legal activists.
Good for the Washington Post and other fair-minded liberals open to reason on this issue. Let’s hope the justices of the Supreme Court, liberal and conservative alike, show similar sensibility in this case and settle the issue once and for all.

The Lincoln Project's foolhardy mission

Texto completo: President Abraham Lincoln said in his first inaugural address: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
The 16th president, the first Republican president, serves as a foundation for the GOP despite the many reincarnations the party has gone through since 1861. Today, Lincoln's name and visage make up the logo for a new super PAC called the Lincoln Project. Created by a group of anti-Trump Republicans (and former Republicans), it launched with a New York Times op-ed titled "We are Republicans, and we want Trump defeated." The piece says, "Over these next 11 months, our efforts will be dedicated to defeating President Trump and Trumpism at the ballot box and to electing those patriots who will hold the line."
Several of those involved with the group are George Conway, Rick Wilson, Steve Schmidt, and John Weaver, a mixture of Republican operatives and former Republican administration employees. I know Wilson personally and consider him a friend. My interactions with Schmidt are limited, but his penchant for behaving "Trumpian" and for having thin skin didn't go unnoticed when I criticized him on Twitter, and he responded by calling me a "third rate columnist." Weaver blocked me on Twitter a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away when I dared to criticize John Kasich. George Conway, the husband of Kellyanne Conway, political counselor to Trump, I know more for his public excoriations of Trump than anything else.
I don't have an issue with the group looking to defeat Trump. We live in the United States, and if the Lincoln Project wants to raise money for Trump's defeat, that's the prerogative of those involved. Where I do take issue with the Lincoln Project is what they believe constitutes "Trumpism."
In an interview with Michael Graham, former New Hampshire GOP chairwoman Jennifer Horn made some interesting comments about congressional Republicans and the Lincoln Project's intention of going after them as well as Trump.
For starters, she said, "Trump-supporting Republicans" have "abandoned their oath of office." Horn doesn't offer up any examples of how they violated their oaths. In the New York Times op-ed, the group wrote, "Congressional Republicans have embraced and copied Mr. Trump's cruelty and defended and even adopted his corruption."
Such language puzzled me when I learned which members of Congress the group plans to target, including Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine. Had the group identified Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, or Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, I'd have more sympathy for its mission.
But Susan Collins? Cory Gardner? How exactly have they "embraced and copied Trump's cruelty?" To go further, Horn said the group would target Collins if she refuses to vote to remove Trump from office:
Question: "And if she votes against removing President Trump from office, or casts a vote to end the impeachment process … "
Horn: "She will be a target, yes."
How does that square with the Lincoln Project lamenting the lack of a "fair trial" in the Senate? By claiming that Collins becomes a target unless she votes to convict, the Lincoln Project chiding Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans for failing to adhere to fairness rings somewhat hollow if the group demands a result before the start of a trial. It also doesn't align with the admonition of abandoning their oath of office. Demanding that one adheres to the desired outcome is precisely the sort of abandonment they're criticizing.
That also raises questions about the long game. The notion that either Collins or Gardner is emblematic of "Trumpism" is absurd. What is the point of seeking their defeat in 2020 — mainly since Trump is not a shoo-in for reelection? In my 25 years of covering and being involved in politics, nothing works better in Washington than a divided government. Having two Republican senators in Colorado and Maine with a Democrat in the White House paints a much better picture than having Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren operating with a majority in Congress for at least two years.
If defeating Trumpism is the goal, then the Lincoln Project should focus its efforts on Trump. Going after Republicans who've won in blue-leaning states will not ensure that we have fewer characters like Trump running for office. It will only encourage more of them to run. It's similar to the hydra, a serpentine monster in Greek mythology with multiple heads. Cut off a head, and two would grow back. To defeat it required cutting off the immortal head.
Trumpism cannot exist without Trump. If the Lincoln Project focuses its attention on defeating Trump, the organization can make the difference it seeks. Defeating Cory Gardner and Susan Collins, however, is only doing a service to the Democratic Party. That's an insult to Abraham Lincoln, not an homage.

Future relevance of Iowa caucuses in question

Texto completo: IOWA CITY, Iowa — Iowa's self-prized first-in-the-nation nominating contest has for years caused seething and resentment among some Democrats. Now a confluence of factors could put its post-2020 in question.
Several 2020 Democratic senators running for president are sidelined in Washington, D.C., for President Trump's impeachment trial. While Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are stuck sitting mute on the Senate floor, on the ground in Iowa, former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 38, largely have the run of the place to campaign.
Supporters of Klobuchar, 59, Sanders, 78, and Warren, 70, are already saying the Feb. 3 caucus results shouldn't be given too much credence, particularly if their candidate does poorly due to limited campaigning in the state. Those three candidates were all initially banking on a win or strong showing in the state to continue in the nomination fight.
Even before the Senate impeachment trial schedule became clear, the Iowa caucuses were under fire from some Democratic candidates. Former 2020 Democrat Julian Castro was among the most prominent voices for change when he was in the race. When running, Castro repeatedly claimed the current process was unfair for voters in a diverse party, because Iowa is 86% white, and New Hampshire, with its primary on Feb. 11, is 91% white.
Castro, 45, now a supporter of Warren, told reporters last week he spoke with Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez about changing the primary process. Castro said Perez seemed receptive to his arguments and that voters might see a different order of states in 2024.
And the late-starting candidacy of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg provides a glimpse of what future Democratic primary processes may look like with Iowa taking on a lessened role. The financial information and news company founder, worth more than $50 billion, is skipping Iowa altogether, along with the New Hampshire primary, Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, and South Carolina primary on Feb. 29.
Bloomberg is instead banking on March 3 Super Tuesday states such as California and Texas, where television advertising still plays an important role in winning votes. That approach is paying at least modest dividends. Bloomberg, 77, now polls at fourth place nationally in some surveys, though he joined the race two months ago, nearly a year after many of his rivals.
Members of his campaign have repeatedly claimed that privileging Iowa in the primary makes little sense and has gone as far as calling the caucuses a waste of resources.
The Iowa gripes are nothing new. They go back to the first Iowa caucuses in February 1972. That election cycle was the first under a new Democratic nominating system meant to take nominating power away from big-city political bosses and elected officials and disperse it to voters in caucuses and primaries.
New York Times writer Robert Bendiner lamented in 1972 about the "haphazard, unfair and wildly illogical" primary process that "have no more relevance to the will of the people than the choice of President by a combination of poker, chess and roulette."

Texto completo: Ivanka Trump praised Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg for bringing more awareness to the issue as her father has sparred with the teenager.
“I’m not going to criticize anyone who’s bringing their energy and voice. That’s not my style. I think she’s elevated awareness and that’s a positive thing,” Trump, 38, told the New York Times.
Before her father was inaugurated, Trump invited former Vice President Al Gore to discuss climate change with him. She also met with actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who gave her a copy of his documentary, Before the Flood.
She and her husband, Jared Kushner, also tried to convince the president to remain in the Paris climate accord.
On Tuesday, President Trump called climate change activists "the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers.” While speaking to reporters Wednesday, he said Thunberg’s proposals are “unrealistic.”
“I believe in American innovation and global innovation,” Ivanka Trump said. “Only a purely pessimistic outlook is not going to help us solve the problem.”

Texto completo: Twenty years ago this month I stood on the banks of Great Pond, in Rome, Maine, holding my children in my arms. It was New Year’s Eve. Over the frozen lake, fireworks burst, welcoming the new millennium.
Something inside of me struggled to be known.
The next morning we climbed French’s Mountain, in Belgrade. We do that every year, on New Year’s Day. We ate clementines.
At the summit I looked down over Long Pond. What would happen, I wondered, if I finally spoke the words aloud, after all these years? Was this the moment I would lose my children, my job, my marriage?
On Jan. 6, 2000, I did it. I’m transgender, I said.
So much has changed since then. In some ways, this country has become safer, as more and more of us step forward to proclaim our realness.
In other ways, we’re more threatened than ever.
When I came out, no one had yet been schooled on the finer points of hating me; most bigots in this country didn’t know a trans woman from the Trans-Siberian Railway.
Because my existence was so far off their radar, few people had bothered to come up with laws to make my life worse. No one lost much sleep over trans folks serving their country. Caitlyn Jenner and Chaz Bono and Janet Mock were not publicly out; Laverne Cox was 13 years from her epic role in “Orange Is the New Black.”
There had been plenty of public fighters for trans people before me — including the iconic Sylvia Rivera, as well my friend Kate Bornstein. But still, there were times when trans advocacy was a lonely place to be.
It is not lonely now. The country abounds with trans people, and not only people like me. There are drag queens and nonbinary people and genderqueer folks and so many others. It is awesome to think of how far we have come.
But it’s also scary. Because now that we’re on the radar, conservatives (and others) have developed a new language with which to demonize us.
In 2000, the terrifying prospect of “gay marriage” was used to fire up the base. Since marriage equality became the law of the land, though, it’s become fairly clear that letting people love one another has somehow failed to destroy the Republic. So conservatives, led by President Trump, have moved on to people like us, coming up with one falsehood after another to diminish our humanity.
A Trump cabinet member warns of “big hairy men” winding up in the ladies room. This is false. I have been in thousands of ladies rooms, and no one has ever said as much as “Lindsey Graham” to me. Fact: more Republican members of Congress have been arrested because of their conduct in restrooms in this country than trans women.
They warn that trans women competing in sports will somehow destroy women’s athletics. This is also false. A year of hormone replacement dramatically affects performance; most trans women lose the events they compete in. It’s only when they win — as the cyclist Rachel McKinnon did at a World Championship in California — that they’re accused of cheating, as Jen Wagner-Assali, the bronze medalist, accused Ms. McKinnon.
Ms. Wagner-Assali somehow failed to mention that she’d beaten Ms. McKinnon in seven of their 12 previous races.
They warn that trans people serving their country in the military — something that President Bone Spurs did not — are an insurmountable problem. This is also false. The chief of staff of each military branch has testified that trans service people pose no threat to readiness.
They warn that coverage for trans soldiers’ medical care is too great a financial burden. This is likewise hooey. A RAND Corporation analysis found the cost of medical coverage for trans service people to be less than 0.017 percent of Pentagon health care spending.
My theory is that people objecting to the sanctity of the powder room, or tearfully defending women’s athletics, or terrified by the prospect of us serving our country, are not actually concerned with those issues at all. What they really object to, when you come right down to it, is the fact that trans people exist in the first place.
Our existence, to use a technical term, weirds them out.
I guess I can understand that. When I was a child, it weirded me out too.
But what they never suggest is what trans people should do instead of being ourselves. We still don’t know what, if anything, makes people trans, but it’s clear that conversion therapy does not work. You can be upset that trans people exist, I suppose, but no amount of upset about us can erase the absolute fact that we are here, same as you, and that we have been here for centuries.
Transgender people were not put here to make Mike Pence — or Germaine Greer — unhappy. Transgender people, like everything else, were created by God — or nature, if you prefer, glorious evidence of creation’s inventiveness. We were not made to hurt your feelings. We were made to see if you meant it when you said, “Love each other as I have loved you.” Did you?
I did not know what the future would hold, as I stood there on the banks of Great Pond twenty New Year’s Eves ago. Maybe it would have raised my spirits if I’d known that in the years to come, I would get to see how truly loving some people could be.
Would it have deterred me, if I had known for certain that the world would also contain truly heartless and terrible people, at least one of whom would eventually become the president? It would not.
I would still have gone about the business of becoming myself. Which is what I did on Jan. 6, 2000. It was the night of the new moon, the first of the new millennium. It was the Feast of Epiphany.
That night I looked once more into a starry sky and said, Enough. I will set out on this journey, although I do not know the way.

Texto completo: Let’s dispense with one thing off the bat: President Donald Trump’s impeachment defense is — in addition to being riddled with false factual claims and misleading characterizations — legal claptrap.
It’s also likely to work.
The essence of the argument, which appears in a 110-page brief submitted Monday by the president’s ragtag legal team in advance of his Senate trial, is that Trump can’t be impeached for behaviors that are not actual crimes.
“Every prior presidential impeachment in our history has been based on alleged violations of existing law — indeed, criminal law,” the brief states. Since House Democrats did not charge the president with committing any specific crimes in abusing his power or obstructing Congress, which are the grounds for the two articles of impeachment that the House of Representatives adopted last month, Trump must skate, the reasoning goes. You can almost hear the lawyers swallowing their pride.
That’s because their argument is, in the words of one legal scholar who recently published a book on the history of impeachment, “constitutional nonsense.” “High crimes and misdemeanors” — the founders’ standard for impeachment — has always been understood to refer to a unique class of offenses, those arising from what Alexander Hamilton called “the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust.”
The federal criminal code didn’t even exist when the Constitution was drafted, yet the framers were aware of the innumerable ways an executive could abuse or violate his trust. They were also aware that impeachment was a long-established remedy for such abuses.
In his authoritative 19th-century legal treatise, Justice Joseph Story of the Supreme Court explained that impeachable acts are by their nature impossible to define in advance. There are many “purely political” offenses that qualify, he wrote, “not one of which is in the slightest manner alluded to in our statute book.”
This view is not remotely controversial. And yet Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor and self-professed liberal who has lately taken to defending Trump against all comers, insists that everyone’s got it wrong. That includes, apparently, Dershowitz himself, who argued back in 1998 that “if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don’t need a technical crime.” Now, Dershowitz argues that to be impeachable, a president’s behavior must be, if not criminal, at least “crime-like”— an argument that could charitably be described as legal-like.
Perhaps it should come as no surprise that a president who described the Constitution as “like a foreign language” would cling to such a legally preposterous claim. But to be fair to Trump and his lawyers, it’s the only one left. The evidence amassed during the House impeachment proceedings — that he shook down a foreign government in the service of his own reelection campaign — is overwhelming, and Trump has yet to counter any of it with so much as a single piece of paper or word of testimony. He has given himself no option but to say, in effect: “Yeah, I did it. So what?”
This is the Trumpian equivalent of, “It’s a free country!” And yet as every grade-school child quickly discovers, that does not mean you can do whatever you want.
So why is Trump’s argument almost certainly going to work? Because the Republican majority in the Senate, led by Mitch McConnell, knows that its own survival is tied to Trump’s, and cares more about its grip on power than its fidelity to constitutional governance.
That’s why McConnell is doing all he can to deep-six the impeachment trial with as little fanfare, and as few witnesses, as possible. He knows the “So what?” gambit becomes harder to sustain in the face of testimony from first hand witnesses to the president’s Ukraine scheme — people like John Bolton, the former national security adviser, and Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer, both of whom have said they would be willing to testify.
An embarrassingly small clot of Republican senators have said they are open to voting to hear from these and possibly other key witnesses. Let’s hope they stick to their guns. For the rest, Trump’s defense brief offers what he might call a perfect solution: He won’t make them respond to serious legal arguments if they won’t hold him to account for his inexcusable behavior. In this bargain, as with so much else over the past three years, the president and the Senate are made for each other.

Texto completo: Donald Trump obviously relishes the role of bully. But his greatest talent by far lies in playing the victim.
He’s a victim of Adam Schiff. A victim of Nancy Pelosi. A victim of all Democrats, really, and of his own seedy henchmen (Michael Cohen, Lev Parnas) and of the “deep state” and of the “fake news media” and of the entire establishment, whatever that is.
He’s a victim of so many forces so many times over that even “martyr” doesn’t do justice to his lot, which is what you get when you multiply Job in the Old Testament by Mel Gibson in “Braveheart” and add the protagonist of “Unbroken.”
No president has ever been treated so badly. I’m not being sarcastic. I’m taking dictation: He has made this exact claim — repeatedly.
His victimhood is front and center in his defense against the articles of impeachment and in the legal papers filed by his lawyers on Monday, as his trial in the Senate moved forward.
The lawyers write of a process “rigged” against Trump. They portray his Democratic accusers as unhinged tormentors, too consumed with his destruction to see how unimpeachably he has really behaved. The 171-page document is so soggy with Trumpian self-pity it weeps.
It’s so bloated with Trumpian hyperbole it waddles. On just one of those pages, his lawyers recount how Democrats exercised “shameful hypocrisy” as they “concocted an unheard-of procedure” and held those infamous “secret hearings in a basement bunker” while journalists “happily fed the public a false narrative” and the poor president was denied any rights whatsoever. This is the bodice ripper of political sob stories. It’s a Harlequin harangue.
It expands on — and continues in the precise spirit of — a preliminary legal brief that his lawyers filed last weekend. “The scream of a wounded animal” was how two legal experts who contribute to The Atlantic assessed that argument. They could as easily have been describing the rest of Trump’s presidency, the whole of his political career and much of his life.
He’s always right and yet always wronged. He demands that we marvel at his invincibility even as we tremble at his degradation. He can vanquish any enemy — and his enemies are legion! — but look at how he’s pushed around. Trump takes a textbook oxymoron and gives it presidential form. Behold, at the Resolute Desk, a jumbo shrimp.
“This goes all the way back to his childhood,” Michael D’Antonio, the author of “The Truth About Trump,” told me. D’Antonio said that at the military-themed boarding school that Trump attended, he was known for complaining to superiors about unfair treatment. “It’s a strategy for him. He believes and has said that whining is a way to get what you want.”
Timothy O’Brien, who wrote the Trump biography “TrumpNation,” recalled that in the 1980s, when Trump failed to get the support that he wanted from Mayor Ed Koch for an enormous development in Manhattan, he threw himself a pity party, railing that “the system and local government were conspiring against him.”
Trump similarly fashioned himself as a beleaguered hero battling dark forces when he bought into the fledgling United States Football League and sought to make it competitive with the National Football League. Goaded by Trump, the USFL filed an antitrust suit against the NFL.
The suit was a bust; the NFL was ordered to pay $3 in damages. But that didn’t throw him off his game, which he upsized for his presidential campaign.
As the conservative columnist Rich Lowry noted in August 2015: “By Trump’s own account, he’s the baddest, smartest thing going, except if you ask him a challenging question, in which case he kicks and screams and demands to know how anyone could treat him so unfairly.” Lowry crowned Trump “the most fabulous whiner in all of American politics.”
The CNN anchor Chris Cuomo subsequently asked Trump about Lowry’s words.
“I am the most fabulous whiner,” Trump conceded. “I keep whining and whining until I win.”
He whined operatically as November 2016 approached and it seemed that he’d lose to Hillary Clinton. “The election is going to be rigged,” he pouted, ever the victim. Then he beat Clinton — and still whined, insisting without proof that she’d done better in the popular vote because of millions of illegal ballots.
Woe is he, the object of a “witch hunt” regarding Russian assistance to his campaign, the butt of a “hoax” about improper pressure on Ukraine, the commander in chief of armed forces that the whole world takes advantage of.
In a key passage of the new book “A Very Stable Genius,” by the Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, Trump rants at top military brass about what he perceives as America’s exploitation by South Korea and by NATO allies, barking, “You’re a bunch of dopes and babies.”
It’s disgusting. It’s also part of his political genius. He has turned himself into a symbol of Americans ’ victimization, telling frustrated voters who crave easy answers that they’re being pushed around by foreigners and duped by the condescending custodians of a dysfunctional system.
He’s their proxy, suffering on their behalf, and in that way he collapses the distance between a billionaire with multiple golf resorts and displaced factory workers struggling to hold on to their one and only homes.
But while it’s a fact that they’ve been dealt a bad hand, it’s a farce that he has. His fortune began with money from Dad. He has stiffed creditors, evaded taxes, attached his name to a bogus diploma mill, skimmed money from a fraudulent philanthropy, run afoul of campaign finance laws, signaled receptiveness to Russian interference in the 2016 election and tried to obstruct the investigation of that — all without any commensurate punishment.
Thanks to Republicans in the Senate, he’s poised to evade punishment again. We should all be such victims.

Texto completo: While the news media has been focused on the “spat” between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, something much more serious has been taking place between the Sanders campaign and Joe Biden. Not to sugarcoat it: The Sanders campaign has flat-out lied about things Biden said in 2018 about Social Security, and it has refused to admit the falsehood.
This is bad; it is, indeed, almost Trumpian. The last thing we need is another president who demonizes and lies about anyone who disagrees with him, and can’t admit ever being wrong. Biden deserves an apology, now, and Sanders probably needs to find better aides.
That said — and this is no excuse for the Sanders camp — it would be good to have Biden explain why, in the more distant past, he went along with the Beltway consensus that Social Security needed to be pared back.
First, about that Biden smear: In 2018, Biden gave a speech attacking Paul Ryan, the then-speaker of the House, for wanting to cut taxes on the rich and pay for those tax cuts by cutting Social Security and Medicare. There was nothing in his remarks that should bother progressives.
However, a Sanders adviser recently circulated a snippet from the video of the event that made it appear that Biden was actually supporting Ryan’s position and calling for Social Security cuts. A few days later a newsletter from the Sanders campaign quoted Biden out of context and made the same claim.
If you want a parallel, it’s as if I were to say, “Some white nationalists claim that Jews are responsible for all our problems,” and a political campaign put out a release saying, “Krugman says ‘Jews are responsible for all our problems.’ ”
Biden did make a misstep in his counterattack, mislabeling the misrepresented video clip as “doctored,” but that doesn’t mean he’s not still due an abject apology. Instead, however, the Sanders campaign has doubled down. Rather than admitting that it smeared a rival, the campaign is going around claiming that Biden has a long record of trying to cut Social Security. There is, unfortunately, some truth in that claim — but it doesn’t excuse either the original lie or the refusal to admit error.
So, about the element of truth in the criticism of Biden: Once upon a time, there was a peculiar consensus among media figures and would-be centrists that the long-run cost of entitlement programs was America’s biggest problem, that Social Security in particular was in crisis and that something had to be done, with the solution including benefit cuts.
This consensus wasn’t based on hard thinking; it was about the attitude politicians were expected to display. As I wrote way back in 2007, proclaiming a Social Security crisis requiring cuts was seen as a “badge of seriousness,” a way of showing how statesmanlike and tough-minded you were.
The candidate I was criticizing, by the way — the guy I said had been “played for a sucker” — was a politician named Barack Obama. But Biden was certainly pulled in by that conventional wisdom, too, so it’s not hard to find old quotes in which he suggested possible Social Security cuts in the name of fiscal responsibility.
But that was then. These days, Biden, like many Democrats, is calling for an expansion of Social Security benefits. That doesn’t make his previous statements irrelevant; he should acknowledge that he has changed his position, and his history on the issue is one reason progressives worry that, if elected, he might fritter away his political capital in vain attempts to reach bipartisan compromise. (His role in passing the draconian 2005 bankruptcy bill, which got Elizabeth Warren involved in politics, is another.)
None of this, however, justifies the Sanders campaign’s lying about recent statements by a man who, after all, may well be the Democratic presidential nominee — and who would, whatever his centrist history, be infinitely more progressive than the current occupant of the White House. And the smearing of Biden reinforces the concerns some of us have about Sanders.
There has always been an ugly edge to some of Sanders’ support, a faction of followers who denounce anyone raising questions about his positions — even Warren! — as a corrupt capitalist shill. Until now, however, you could argue that Sanders himself wasn’t responsible for the bad behavior of some of his supporters.
You can’t make that argument now. The dishonest smears and the doubling down on those smears are coming from the top of the Sanders campaign; even if they aren’t coming directly out of Sanders’ mouth, he could and should have stopped them. The fact that Sanders isn’t apologizing to Biden and replacing the people responsible says uncomfortable things about his character.
I don’t want to go overboard here. While there is a Trumpian feel to some of what we’re seeing from the Sanders campaign, Bernie Sanders is no Donald Trump. As we’ve just seen, there are some real issues with the people surrounding him, but they’re nothing like Trump’s gang of thugs. And in practice a Sanders presidency, like a Biden presidency, would be a vast improvement, morally as well as substantively, on what we have now.
But right now, Sanders and his campaign are behaving badly, and they need to be called on it.

Texto completo: London • Meghan, Harry. I hear you’re ditching your royal titles and moving to Canada. And why not? You met there, the summers are lovely, and the country is not actively crowdsourcing “bong money” to make sure a big bell goes off at the precise moment it throws itself into international disarray. Plus, there is the matter of your family’s longstanding history as merciless imperialists and a swathe of British citizens and newspapers who, for reasons that couldn’t possibly be racism, have harangued, harassed and libeled you both into the ground. This, combined with how good I know you both look in winter hats, makes me think it will be a very fruitful move indeed.
As my own family’s problematically ginger second-born and someone who fled Canada for England, I’ve recently completed something of a reverse-Harry and am therefore in a perfect position to dispense some classic, North American-style unsolicited advice. So here’s what you can expect from your new life post-Megxit, plus some insider tips for making the most of your new life abroad.
First, Canadians. Our national personality exists somewhere between America and Britain on the earnestness-stoicism index. In fact, we’re a bit of a mix of both cultures. Like Americans, we’re unafraid to express a little (or a lot) of emotion when confronted with a bad hockey team or the weather in February, but as with the English, our self-effacing comments are merely a front for an unshakable belief in the ultimate superiority of our way of life. The two of you represent a conundrum for the average Canadian as we are unkind to tall poppies but desperate for attention from international celebrities of any kind. I wouldn’t worry too much about fitting in. By questioning the point of your relationship with the monarchy, you’ve already been spiritually Canadian for months.
Next: It’s a stereotype, but apologizing is a big part of Canadian culture. As a British person, Harry should have mastered this already, but for Meghan’s sake — and in case Harry’s royal privileges have blunted his abilities in this area — consider practicing such classic apologies as “sorry just getting this text” or “sorry that thing I said about just getting your text was obviously a lie.” When those feel comfortable you can work up to more personally applicable examples, like “sorry your taxes pay for our security detail,” and “sorry my family stole your priceless marble statues, nation of Greece.” Some other Canadian tidbits: The winters can be truly punishing, poutine is actually very good, knit hats are known as “toques,” and thousands of Indigenous people have been without clean water for decades.
Unfortunately, though Canada has much to recommend it, you may find some of Britain’s least pleasant traits thrive there as well. For instance: While Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did cancel racism by bravely wearing multicultural statement socks to a parade in 2017, he recently found himself canceled, and racism very much “back on” after doing full-on blackface somewhere between three and “I couldn’t possibly guess how many” times. Still, it will be a comfort, I’m sure, after your terrible treatment at the hands of the British media to know that because of layoffs, closures, and slashed budgets, an independent Canadian press will probably only exist for another 10 years, tops. (While this is great news for you, it is a real shame for the scores of talented journalists who live and work there, so maybe play that one close to the chest while you’re doing the press tour to relaunch Meghan’s lifestyle blog.)
Now, to friends: I understand that Meghan already has a local bestie in the form of the shoe store heiress and celebrity wedding officiant Jessica Mulroney. Harry, on the other hand, will need a high-profile new pal, and where better to look than the vast, confusing world of Canadian celebrities. He’d look great beside one of our handsome Ryans (Gosling or Reynolds); a friendship with Mike Myers could be very “groovy, baby” indeed; Elon Musk and Grimes, two deeply cursed Canadians, will be parents soon … Might Archie enjoy a play date with little Quant? Celine Dion is unfortunately on tour, though Drake comes home often, and Rachel McAdams lives up north, too. Failing these, my mother lives on a street where “Suits” used to film, which, as far as I can tell from her stories about it, puts her rank on set somewhere near or above executive producer. She’s thrilled you’re coming to Canada and would be more than happy to babysit … what I’m saying is, you’ve got options.
I think you’re ready. All that’s left is to purchase a cruelty-free puffer jacket and start pretending you like tourtière. Ultimately, it’s not so different over there. Just remember: Crisps are “chips,” chips are “fries,” and our shared legacy of colonial destruction is “something we largely refuse to discuss.”
(Harry’s gran is still on all the money. You’ll be fine.)

Texto completo: "A Warning" - by Anonymous, the Republican who wrote a New York Times column in 2018 about the "resistance" in the Trump administration - paints a picture of a disaster in progress.
"I cannot overstate the consequences of re-electing Donald Trump," the author writes. "I've seen the impact of his leadership on our government and country, up close and all too personal. The Trump administration is an unmitigated catastrophe, and the responsibility rests entirely at his feet, the predictable outcome of assigning organizational leadership to a man of weak morals. What is more regrettable is that his faults are amplifying our own. I believe firmly that whatever benefits we may have gained from individual Trump policies are vastly outweighed by the incalculable damage he has done to the fabric our republic."
In the beginning, Anonymous writes, staffers wanted Trump to succeed "but we were alarmed by his unstable behavior." Now "the instability within the Trump administration has intensified." The few people who were willing to challenge the president have been replaced by people like Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, whose philosophy is to "let Trump be Trump."
The "warning" is that if Trump is re-elected, "the guardrails will be gone entirely, and freed from the threat of defeat, this president will feel emboldened to double down on his worst impulses."
The author says he/she may come forward in due course. I hope so, because that would give the book more credibility.
Quotes from the book tell the story:
Trump "wants to do what he wants to do, consequences be damned."
"Fundamentally, the president never learned to manage the government's day-to-day functions, or showed any real interest in doing so. ... The White House, quite simply, is broken."
"Not everyone sees the full Trump, especially the one who is red-faced, consumed with fury, and teetering at the outer limits of self-control."
"The demands of the job rarely keep him away from the golf course."
"The sheer level of intellectual laziness is astounding."
A group of fiscal conservatives warned the president about the eventual dangers of his spending, which is adding a trillion (yes, trillion) dollars a year to our deficit. In one such meeting, Trump reportedly said, "Yeah, but I won't be here."
"The president's impetuousness poses a danger to our military, the full extent of which will not be known for years. He is more than a minor headache for the Pentagon. He is a blinding migraine."
"I once walked out of a meeting with the president, and a visibly shaken briefer, who was new to the Trump circus, pulled me aside. 'Are you kidding me?' he remarked. Moments earlier Trump expressed a spur-of-the-moment reversal about a military mission. 'What should we do? The briefer asked nervously. 'He wants us to scrap everything the agency was planning.' ... 'Relax,' I assured him. 'We aren't going to do anything. I swear he'll change him mind tomorrow,' I was wrong. The president changed his mind later that afternoon."
"Fundamentally, Trump does not understand how trade works. ... Estimates show the economy has already lost hundreds of thousands of jobs because of his trade war. ... Working-class and poor Americans will be hit hardest."
"When he does sit down for a briefing on sensitive information, it's the same as any other Trump briefing. He hears what he wants to hear, and disregards what he doesn't. Intelligence information must comport to his worldview for it to stick. If it doesn't, it's 'not very good.' As a result, the president of the United States is often ignorant on the most serious national security threats we face and is, therefore, ill-prepared to defend against them."
"The unavoidable conclusion is that the president sees himself as above the law."
"Our enemies and adversaries recognize the president is a simplistic pushover. They are unmoved by his bellicose Twitter threats because they know he can be played. ... He is visibly moved by flattery. He folds in negotiations, and he is willing to give up the farm for something that merely looks like a good deal, whether it is or not. They believe he is weak, and they take advantage of him. When they cannot, they simply ignore him."
"The president has been called a pathological liar. I used to cringe when I heard people say that just to score political points, and I thought it was unfair. Now I know it's true."
"Despite some accomplishments, it's evident Donald Trump is behaving immorally, weakening the party he professes to lead, undermining democratic institutions, abandoning crucial U.S. alliances, emboldening our adversaries, dividing Americans with hateful rhetoric and chronic dishonesty, and surrounding himself with people who will only reinforce his defects. ... Donald Trump deserves to be fired."
Wow. All this is from a Republican who wanted Trump to succeed. And it's entirely consistent with what we have seen and heard ourselves.

RON JOHNSON AND MITCH MCCONNELL ARE CORRUPTING IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

Texto completo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's declared, as she was preparing to send the articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate: "Every senator now faces a choice: to be loyal to the president or the Constitution."
Unfortunately, there is good reason to believe that most members of the Republican majority in the chamber will err on the side of partisanship rather than the rule of law. That is shameful, if perhaps not remarkable at a point when Donald Trump has made the Republican Party his partisan plaything.
But some senators are more shameful than others. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has been identified by key witnesses as having been personally engaged in an "irregular" pattern of communications as Trump and his henchmen sought to warp U.S. policy for political purposes. He is a witness to the very scandal that sparked the impeachment inquiry - so much so that a Washington Post headline announced: "Sen. Johnson, ally of Trump and Ukraine, surfaces in crucial episodes in the saga." The New York Times headline on an article about Johnson read: "'He's in Deeper Water Than Most': GOP Senator at Center of Impeachment Inquiry."
Johnson, who has attacked those who revealed Trump's wrongdoing, cannot possibly serve as an impartial juror for Trump's impeachment trial. In any normal circumstance, you would expect the leader of Senate Republicans to counsel Johnson to recuse himself.
But that won't happen because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a crooked senator who admits to coordinating with an impeached president and his cabal of defenders to undermine the work of the Senate. He has acknowledged his engagement in wrongdoing of the highest order: conniving to upend the system of checks and balances he has sworn to maintain.
This is not a close call. Americans of every partisanship, and every ideological bent (aside, perhaps, from the monarchists), should recognize that McConnell's words were not just unacceptable but disqualifying.
Or, as Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., explained in December, "Senator McConnell has promised to sabotage the impeachment trial and he must recuse himself."
Demings, a member of the key House panels with regard to impeachment - the Intelligence and Judiciary panels - has now been named as one of seven House managers for the impeachment trial. To her credit, she refuses to back off on recusal. Asked last week about whether she still believes McConnell must step aside, the Florida representative said, "I certainly do."
What is remarkable about this impeachment process as it moves to the Senate is the open corruption of senators such as Johnson and
McConnell.
The majority leader announced his choice long before the trial began, when he signaled that he will conspire with the White House to avert accountability. McConnell told Fox News prior to the House's December approval of two articles of impeachment against Trump, "We have no choice but to take it up, but we'll be working through this process, hopefully in a fairly short period of time, in total coordination with White House counsel's office and the people who are representing the president in the well of the Senate."
That was a stunning statement, even by the standards of a Senate that McConnell's disregard for ethical standards has turned into a political punch line. It drew rebukes from Democrats and from Republicans such as Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who said she was "disturbed" by the majority leader's announcement of a coordination scheme. "To me," Murkowski said in December, "it means that we have to take that step back from being hand in glove with the defense, and so when I heard what leader McConnell had said, I happened to think that that has further confused the process."
"Confused" is a euphemism.
The proper phrase is "further corrupted the process."
McConnell has literally announced that "I'm not an impartial juror."
The necessary response to McConnell's pronouncements came from Demings, who warned in December, "No court in the country would allow a member of the jury to also serve as the accused's defense attorney. The moment Senator McConnell takes the oath of impartiality required by the Constitution, he will be in violation of that oath."
Demings, a former police chief, was on point. The Constitution identifies the Senate as the chamber with the "sole Power to try all Impeachments" and stipulates that "when sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation." The oath is clear in its language and intent:
"I solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case may be) that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of (Donald Trump), I will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws: So help me God."
When McConnell and Johnson took that oath last week, they accepted what Demings correctly described as "a tremendous responsibility." They cannot fulfill that responsibility.
When wholly amoral senators openly abuse their positions and manipulate the procedures and processes of the chamber, as their colleagues undertake one of their most solemn duties, it would be even more wholly amoral for impeachment managers, senators, and the American people to look away. The call for Ron Johnson and Mitch McConnell to recuse themselves must be amplified and extended. It should become a central theme in the permanent record of this awful moment in American history when sworn oaths are openly disregarded by the unscrupulous servants of an imperial president.

Texto completo: Here we are over half way through January and we can already see 2020 taking shape. Cynics may take heart. There are no disappointments in store for them. Some may have hoped that the Democratic presidential debates would go on and on until the audience completely disappeared, but they must know that this was really too much to ask for.
They will find ample consolation watching the remaining competitors desperately trying to shin up the greasy pole that leads to the nomination. During the last encounter Elizabeth Warren strode across the stage to accuse Bernie Sanders of accusing her of being a liar—“I think you called me a liar on national TV,” said she severely. Stunned, Bernie tried to fend her off, then counter-attack, then went back to fender-mode. She sticks with her accusation that he told her a woman couldn’t win a national election. He sticks to denying he ever said that. This “she said/he denied,” “he said/she denied” routine may continue to the Democratic convention. And maybe into 2021.
Pete Buttigieg has spent more money on polling than his rivals, in a desperate effort to discover what he really believes. As the first openly gay contender for the presidency, he has a fair claim to membership in a “marginalized” group of Americans. More impressive, he is the “wife” in his marriage. But there are suspicions among the more zealous gayetarians about the depth of his commitment. A 2016 photo shows Mayor Pete in a Salvation Army uniform while ringing the regulation bell. Since the Army has not abandoned its commitment to traditional marriage, that makes it an enemy and Pete has been denounced as “the gay version of an Uncle Tom or Auntie Em.” The most militant gays have taken offense because his husband cancelled a rally at a gay bar that features a dancing pole. “Love us, love our pole” seems to be their rallying cry.
Pete’s credentials—-Harvard, Oxford, McKinsey Consulting, U.S. Naval Reserves—have endeared him to educated suburbanites. His mid-western manners are appealing to some. He’s as glib as Clinton or Obama. He appeals to the moderately leftist Democrats as the moderate who can save America from four more years of Donald Trump if Joe Biden bumbles and bungles his way to defeat.
There’s a problem. Mayor Pete has no perceptible following in the Afro-American population.
It appears that his attempts to compare the sufferings of prosperous white gays with impoverished black folks generates more resentment than rapport.

And that brings another entertainment to amuse the cynics among us. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Oakland, California), a leading progressives is denouncing her party’s criteria for choosing presidential debating participants as “systemically discriminatory” against people of color. The Democrats started out with a presidential campaign field they acclaimed as the most diverse in history and ended up with Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Elizabeth Warren—all shamefully white. “I’m not a happy camper.” Lee explained, “When you establish rules that become systemically discriminatory against people of color, then you’ve got to question your party and how they’re making all these decisions. I don’t like the message it’s sending.” One solution she proposes is to reduce the importance of financing as a qualification for participation.
And this brings us to Tom Steyer, the lone billionaire among the six debate finalists. And that brings to Michael Bloomberg, the fourteenth richest man in the world with an estimated fifty billion dollars at his disposal. According to the New York Times he has already spent $200 million setting up his campaign organization and claims he may spent a billion. His primary objective, Mike tells us, is not so much to become president as it is to prevent Donald Trump from getting re-elected. He does not rule out spending millions on behalf of Warren or Sanders if one of them get the nomination. This sounds right and may even be true. But cynics will have reason to rejoice if Bloomberg receives the Democratic Party nomination. The left-left-left “Bernie Bros” will explode in fury. Their hatred for what they call “corporate Democrats” will set their eyeballs rotating, their noses bleeding, and their mouths frothing. This is a lot to hope for, but even cynics must sometimes allow themselves to hope.
Let’s not forget the impeachment farce yet. The House impeached, but there must be a trial in the Senate where a two-thirds majority is needed for conviction. It’s possible that a couple of Republican senators will vote to convict, but it’s not likely. Sen. McConnell seems intent on a rapid verdict. It will be acquittal. Senator Schumer, who has no hope for conviction would like to prolong the trial so more garbage can be dumped on the gilt-tipped head of his arch-foe. He’ll be disappointed. A successful farce is a funny farce and most of the impeachment foolery has been boring, but I’ll always treasure the memory of Speaker Pelosi signing the impeachment documents with multiple pens. Every participant will get one of those souvenir pens. Her conscientious signature work went on and on.
According to my informant a pen used to write a period on the document can be sold for $1,250, one used for a semi-colon goes for $750 and complete letters vary from $200 to $300. I can’t vouch for my informant’s accuracy. He came in a dream and didn’t give me his name.
This is a just a sample of the delights that await us in the year 2020.

Texto completo: Women's basketball star Maya Moore has taken herself out of consideration for the 2020 U. S. Olympic team to continue her push for the freedom of a Missouri inmate she believes was wrongly convicted.
Moore, who's led the Minnesota Lynx to four WNBA championships, will also skip a second consecutive professional season in her efforts to free Jonathan Irons -- a 39-year-old man serving a 50-year sentence for burglary and assaulting the homeowner with a gun.
“Basketball has not been foremost in my mind," Moore told the New York Times in an exclusive interview. "I’ve been able to rest, and connect with people around me, actually be in their presence after all of these years on the road. And I’ve been able to be there for Jonathan. ”
OPINION: We're not talking about Maya Moore enough

Moore met Irons in 2017 when she visited the Jefferson City Correctional Center. Since then, she has helped pay for his defense team and has attended several of his courtroom hearings.
"Over the last year we have been in frequent contact with Maya around the great work in criminal justice reform and ministry in which she is fully engaged," Lynx coach and general manager Cheryl Reeve said in a statement released by the team. "We are proud of the ways that Maya is advocating for justice and using her platform to impact social change. "
Moore, 30, told the Times she isn't ready to retire, but her absence from the upcoming Olympics is a major loss for women's basketball.
“We are going to miss Maya tremendously, but we also respect her decision,” U. S. national team director Carol Callan told the Times. "We know how devoted she is to what she believes in, and that what she is doing is remarkable. ”
Moore helped lead Team USA to the gold medal at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics.

Texto completo: Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and current long-shot — make that, loooooooong-shot — candidate for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, is a keen student of New Hampshire politics. In an interview with me last week, he noted the following fact: Every time an incumbent president of either party faced a significant primary challenge in the Granite State, he failed in his bid for reelection.
It happened to George H.W. Bush in 1992 after Patrick Buchanan took 38% of the New Hampshire vote.
It happened to Jimmy Carter in 1980 after Teddy Kennedy took 39%.
It happened to Gerald Ford in 1976 after Ronald Reagan took 48%.
It happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1968 after Eugene McCarthy took 42%.
It happened to Harry Truman in 1952 when Estes Kefauver beat him outright, 55% to 44%.
So, Weld reasons, why not try to make it happen to Donald Trump, too?
That’s the hopeful thought in what otherwise seems to be Weld’s hopeless bid to derail a president whose support among Republicans was 89% last month, according to Gallup. Weld is too much a politician to admit publicly that he sees no shot for himself of winning — a Messiah complex lies at the root of many monumental ambitions.
But he’s also wise enough to know that losing well can achieve great things, like bringing down a president who, he said, “regards the law as something to be evaded.” Can that be done between now and Feb. 11, the date of the New Hampshire primary? Weld rests his hopes on two things: New England Republicanism, which remains alive and well despite reports of its demise; and Trump’s trial in the Senate, whose result may not yet be a forgone conclusion.
On the former, note that Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire all have Republican governors, who, like Weld, are relative moderates compared to the rest of the party. New England Republicans can also be fickle in their loyalties, and late to make up their minds: Buchanan was also seen as a nonstarter against Bush Sr. just weeks before the 1992 primary.
On the latter, Weld knows a lot about the impeachment process, having worked on the House Judiciary Committee’s staff as a young lawyer in 1974 as it considered articles against Richard Nixon. Nixon, Weld recalled, “was essentially forced to withdraw from the presidency because he had been caught lying on television to the American people on one topic” — a foothill of a deception compared to Trump’s Karakoram range.
Weld also knows how quickly things can turn in the course of a trial. “Cases don’t look the same at the end as they do at the beginning,” he noted, recalling his prosecutions of public corruption in the 1980s as U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, where he won 109 convictions in 111 corruption cases. He believes that if four Republican senators join Democrats in voting to call witnesses — Ohio’s Rob Portman could provide the decisive vote — then anything is possible.
“The one sport where the unthinkable can become the inevitable in a matter of weeks or even days,” Weld said, “is national politics, not the National Football League.”
Maybe that’s right, assuming devastating testimony from John Bolton, the former national security adviser; former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas; and who knows who (or what) else. Not that any kind of testimony is likely to sway the 67 senators needed for a conviction. But it’s not quite out of the question that it might, in the coming weeks, sway a large fraction of New Hampshire Republicans to vote against the president, thereby setting into motion forces that could bring him down.
That’s the hope, at any rate. The odds against? I’d say 20-to-1 — which is to say, still worth a shot. If it fails, Weld said he would not run as an independent. Unlike in 2016, when he ran with Gary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket (and won 4.5 million votes) he has no interest in playing the spoiler to anyone in the race except Trump.
The larger question if it fails is what becomes of the GOP. Weld compared the party to the late-stage Whigs of the early 1850s, which were riven between the nativist Know Nothing faction and the antislavery wing that would become the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln. Fortunately, the good side won that time.
And this time? The best conservative case for rooting for a Democrat to win this fall — any Democrat, including Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren — is that it might be the only way to save the Republican Party from itself. That could happen if a critical mass of conservatives repudiates Trumpism or forms a new party on the Lincoln model. Weld calls it the Liberty Party.
Alternatively a Sanders or Warren victory could send the GOP to even further extremes. In politics, as in nature, forces always come in pairs. Democrats who want to see Republicans recover their center need to protect their own. In the meantime, wish Bill Weld well in his Granite State carom shot.

Texto completo: Emily, my dearest wife of 37 years, died today (Jan. 9) at 4:30 pm.
Today is our 37th anniversary and she died around the time we were married by a judge at the Thurston County Courthouse 37 years ago.
We made a promise to each other that we would never go to bed when we were angry with each other. We always put our differences aside, kissed, hugged and stated our love for each other. She was a wonderful wife and cared for me always, just as I cared for her.
Emily [Zopf] was a wonderful, creative artist, a fine woodworker, an amazing solver of puzzles, a fine mother to our beloved son, Kris, valedictorian of her Laboratory Science program at Oregon Health Sciences University and of her high school class in Yellow Springs, Ohio. She graduated from Antioch College with a B.A. and earned an MFA from the University of Washington.
She designed our timber frame house in the mountains east of Taos and built our wood shop with me. She said that building the house was the happiest time of her life. Em worked for 10 years at the Holy Cross Hospital Lab in Taos. She was the person to go to if you wanted answers and solutions. She loved working in the lab and felt a deep sense of service to our adopted community of Taos.
Em loved nature and the wilderness. We spent many days hiking in the mountains of Washington, Oregon and New Mexico, and we kayaked Puget Sound, the San Juan Islands and the inland passage between Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia. Emily was very frugal and a conservationist supreme. We've wrung most of the carbon emissions out of our house, charge our Tesla from our solar panels and we rarely flew. Emily and I did The New York Times crossword puzzle together virtually every day from early 1998.
We shared our lives together completely, and I will carry her with me in memories until I die.
Bob Bresnahan lives in Taos.

A FITTING TRIBUTE

Texto completo: For decades, the Paul Taylor Dance Company has been performing in Philadelphia every few years. This weekend's visit, at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, is the company's 17th time dancing here - and its first without its late founder Taylor at the helm.
Taylor died in 2018 at age 88. Michael Novak, the company's new artistic director, is a longtime Paul Taylor dancer who spent some of his formative years in Philadelphia. In the early 2000s, Novak attended University of the Arts and was an apprentice at the Pennsylvania Academy of Ballet, in Narberth. He was also a waiter at Marathon on the Square.
The company's current tour is a multiyear retrospective honoring Taylor, Novak said by phone last week, with different programs along the way drawing from a pool of 147 Paul Taylor pieces. "We're touring retrospectives of dances he felt were very important in his maturity as a choreographer - works I love, and that audiences love."
The Philadelphia stop is also programmed in honor of Randy Swartz, the firebrand behind NextMove Dance, which joined Annenberg in a copresenting partnership in 2018. Swartz is retiring this spring after 50 years of bringing dance companies to Philadelphia.
Novak said Swartz is part of Taylor's legacy. "Randy has been a huge ally for us," he said. "He actually helped commission Paul Taylor's famous work Speaking in Tongues," from 1988.
The Taylor company reached out to the Philadelphia promoter to help build the program for the Annenberg performances, and Swartz said he found that touching. "I have two words for you," he said, "old and flattered."
The lineup is the dance equivalent of comfort food, with three Taylor favorites: Syzygy, Sunset, and Piazzolla Caldera. The first and third numbers were chosen specifically to honor Swartz.
Syzygy is a 1987 piece that hasn't been danced in 20 years. Novak calls it "a dynamic, athletic work," and Swartz says he loves that energy.
"It was also a departure for Mr. Taylor from his avant-garde beginnings," Swartz said. "It's a piece in which the audience is left wondering, 'Are they going to survive?' It's just so over-the-top. It's so energetic, it's so crazy."
Piazzolla Caldera, was created in 1987 and hasn't been danced since 2006. It's a take on the tango but uses no tango steps, and Swartz said it expresses "all the things that Paul Taylor is. . . . He took a social dance and turned it into a company piece. There's characters in it, there's humor in it. It's Paul Taylor pouring all of his genius into it. It's a great closer."
The other piece, Sunset, was created in 1983 and hasn't been danced since 1988. It is a romantic look at relationships between soldiers on leave and the women they meet. It is the type of Taylor piece that made former New York Times dance critic Alistair Macaulay call him "one of the superlative war poets."
Taylor minus Taylor
For audience members who might be nervous about how the company has fared since Novak succeeded his late boss, reviews have been positive. In November, New York Times dance critic Gia Kourlas wrote, "the company blooms under his direction."
Wall Street Journal dance critic Robert Greskovic wrote that Novak's initial steps are "taking flight nicely, propelling Paul Taylor's legacy into a lively future."
The secret, Novak said, is a careful balance of honoring the great master and moving forward.
"You're trying to take audiences who have a relation with Paul Taylor's world. You're telling them it's going to be OK," he said. That means "sharing passions, comforting them," but also innovating, pushing boundaries, and generating excitement without alienating."
With that in mind - not to mention his enormous new job - Novak retired from dancing following the company's November performance at Lincoln Center. Now he likes to sit in the front of the house as much as possible, watching from different seats and speaking to audience members.
"What is the vibe in the room?" he likes to note. "That's something I'm very sensitive to."
Philadelphia audiences will be watching the company at a time of transition. Last spring, six signature Paul Taylor dancers retired, including Michael Trusnovec and Laura Halzack, and Novak has now hired seven new company members in his short time in charge - although he's trying not to rock the boat.
"There's a famous quote about Paul Taylor," Novak said. " 'Paul Taylor doesn't hire dancers, he hired people.' It is a very warm company. We're on the road a third to a half of the year. We've been together through injuries, marriages, childbirth, separation, moving, and deaths of parents."
One of his current dancers, Madelyn Ho, took time away from the company a few years ago to go to Harvard Medical School. Alumni consult on historic works and perform as guests. Bettie De Jong, who joined the company in 1962 and was one of Taylor's former dance partners, remains on staff as a rehearsal director.
"There is a sense of family here that is very special."

Texto completo: BY DAVID BAUDER
AP Media Writer
NEW YORK - CBS was the first major network to break away from President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate on Tuesday, allowing its viewers to watch their regular afternoon fare instead of a debate over a proposed amendment to subpoena White House documents.
The decision illustrated the on-the-fly judgments television executives will face every day of the trial, juggling concerns over millions of dollars in advertising revenue, news purists cognizant of the weight of history and angry soap opera fans.
Uncertainty over the Senate's schedule from hour to hour, much less day to day, complicates things even further.
The decisions were easier when ABC, CBS and NBC dominated the landscape and were very cognizant of their public service responsibility. Now viewers have options - cable networks from CNN to C-SPAN and streaming services - if they want to follow the trial. While Tuesday's
Session was historic, opening the third impeachment trial ever in the United States, it will still be a while before the meat of the case was examined.
Yet it was noticed when CBS cut off the trial around 3:15p.m. ET, while rivals ABC and NBC stuck with it.
"Uncle Walter is crying," tweeted New York Times reporter Jim Rutenberg, referencing the late, legendary CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite.
Tweets of incredulity at CBS for abandoning history mixed with those from angry daytime TV fans. "Why do you have impeachment on all platforms?" tweeted one viewer, who was more interested in watching "The Young and the Restless" and "The Bold & The Beautiful."
A CBS representative noted that the network's news streaming service was continuing to carry the trial, and that network affiliates were given the choice to continue to show the Senate if that's what their executives preferred.
Rivals at ABC and NBC privately noted that the fact that it was the trial's opening day played into decisions to stick with it longer. Fox, which doesn't have its own news division, rarely breaks away from traditional programming.
All of the broadcast networks had contingency plans in place depending on what was being shown and the time of day. There was little interest in making public pronouncements of their plans given the fluidity of the situation.
"These decisions are difficult and they're not always solely in the hands of the news divisions," said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive and now dean of Hofstra University's School of Communication. Network entertainment and corporate executives also weigh in.
Sticking with news coverage becomes more difficult for the networks in the prime-time hours of 8 to 11p.m., because that means a more significant loss of advertising revenue, Lukasiewicz said.
That's why network executives were keenly interested in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's decision Tuesday that impeachment managers for the House and president would have three days instead of two to make their cases. It means fewer hours in prime time are likely to be chewed up.
There were no such tough decisions at the cable networks CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC. Each carried virtually every minute of House hearings and votes on impeachment, and are expected to do the same with the trial. It's a winner for them financially; all cable news ratings soared during the House proceedings.
On Tuesday, CNN was already using its programming choice in advertising.
"Don't miss a moment," CNN promised in a network ad. "Complete coverage."

‘Tightrope’ argues for greater compassion and social responsibility

Resumen: Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn take an unsparing but empathetic look at the factors exerting a downward pull on working-class communities.

Texto completo: A quarter of the children that Nicholas Kristof rode the school bus with growing up in Yamhill, Oregon, in the 1960s and ’70s, are dead, their lives cut short by drug and alcohol addiction and suicide. He suggests a correlation between these so-called “deaths of despair” and the fact that life expectancy in the United States has declined for the last three years. 
In “Tightrope: Americans Reaching for Hope,” Kristof and co-author Sheryl WuDunn examine the crisis in working-class America by traveling to stagnating communities across the country, but they return again and again to the heartrending stories that have resulted from the collapse of the social fabric in Kristof’s beloved hometown.  
Kristof is a New York Times Op-Ed columnist, and WuDunn, with whom he has cowritten four previous books (the two shared a Pulitzer Prize in 1990 for their reporting on China), is a former Times reporter. Between them, the married couple has four Ivy League degrees and a Rhodes scholarship. In short, they’re the sort of “coastal elites” who are often accused of condescending to working-class people in our extremely polarized political climate. But Kristof’s roots run deep in Yamhill, a tight-knit rural community whose economy was built on farming, logging, and manufacturing, and he and WuDunn write about its residents – many of whom are their friends – with affection and empathy.
The stories they tell are almost unbearably bleak. The Kristof family farm was half a mile from that of the Knapp’s, and the author rode the bus to school with the five Knapp children. The Knapp parents had both grown up poor in homes without plumbing or electricity, and the father was a violent alcoholic who died young of drug- and alcohol-related causes. Still, the Knapps had been able to buy their property in Oregon, and with the promise of a good education, it seemed that life would continue to improve for their children. Instead, four out of the five Knapp children are dead: one died of liver failure, one of hepatitis linked to drug use. One perished, immobilized by alcohol, in a house fire; another died after the meth he was cooking exploded. The lone survivor spent more than a decade in prison.  
Kristof and WuDunn explain these harrowing stories by describing the larger forces at work, with 1 in 7 Americans now living in poverty. They examine the effects, in Yamhill and elsewhere, of vanishing, decent blue-collar union jobs; the rise in drug abuse (which began, all too often, with an opioid prescription from a doctor); and, in large part because of the war on drugs, which they consider “perhaps the worst single policy mistake of the last half century,” the rise in mass incarceration. They also decry the “gratuitous cruelty” of recent American social policy and note that it wasn’t always this way. From the Homestead Acts to the GI Bill, the government was once in the business of creating opportunity (which, they acknowledge, was often available only to white people). Replacing punitive public policy with policy approaches that recognize a collective responsibility for our fellow citizens, they argue, will in the long run save billions of dollars and prevent untold suffering.
The authors are aware that some readers will have trouble mustering sympathy for some of the people they write about. They “look unsparingly at failures of personal responsibility,” but they also “examine equally rigorously the failures of government, of institutions, and of society.” They emphasize that children who grow up in dysfunctional homes have the deck stacked against them, through no fault of their own. One of the Knapp grandchildren, Amber, seemed to break the family cycle of downward mobility and early death, graduating from high school, marrying and having children, and working successfully in information technology. But she too became addicted, losing her marriage, her children, and her job and going in and out of prison. “When you’re raised in chaos and you’re around chaos a lot, your body adapts to the chaos,” she told the authors. “I was actually creating the chaos to feel normal.” Kristof and WuDunn, who argue that wise policy can intervene to improve these outcomes, mourn the wasted potential of smart and ambitious people like Amber. The authors speculate about what might have happened had she been born into a stable family or received well-timed interventions to set her on a more constructive path.
“This has been a wrenching book for us to write,” the authors confide at the outset. It is at times wrenching to read. But Kristof and WuDunn, in addition to peppering the narrative with heroic individuals around the country making a difference in their communities, offer a range of sensible policy suggestions: expanded early childhood education, increased vocational training, long-term intensive drug treatment programs, and experimental initiatives like universal high school graduation laws. In addition to looking back at all that's been lost, the authors – compassionate, solutions-oriented, and ultimately optimistic – offer a path forward.

'DUTY' CALLS KLOBUCHAR TO D.C.

Texto completo: DES MOINES - More than a dozen Iowa lawmakers assembled at the State Capitol on Tuesday in a well-choreographed display of regional support for U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, just weeks ahead of the first-in-the-nation caucuses that will determine the viability of her White House bid.
All that was missing from the political tableau was the candidate.
Klobuchar had left Iowa earlier in the morning, bound for Washington, D.C., jury duty as a senator in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
Confronted with a trial that could drag out a week or more, Klobuchar's campaign has been forced to rely on a little help from friends, family and a cadre of surrogates who can keep her name fresh in the minds of voters sorting through a dwindling field of Democrats vying for the party nomination.
"We're an army of legislators, and we're going to be talking to people in our districts and, for that measure, to people all across the state to let them know we're behind Amy," said Iowa state Sen. Liz Mathis, who represents the Cedar Rapids area. Klobuchar, she said, "has laid the groundwork, she's made an impression on people and it's up to us to keep getting that word out."
The enforced absence comes at a critical stage for Klobuchar's bid in Iowa, a neighboring Midwestern state she has visited 30 times as a presidential candidate, underscoring its significance to her campaign hopes. Riding a slow rise in the polls here for several months, Klobuchar has been drawing bigger crowds and generating much needed media attention.
Now the Minnesota senator's campaign team must figure out how to fill the void.
The trial, which got underway Tuesday in the Senate, gave Klobuchar and at least the three other senators in the race -- including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren -- a chance to perform on the national stage.
"This is my constitutional duty, and that's how it is," Klobuchar said on her way to the Senate floor. "We're all sitting in there."
But she and some other Democratic senators bristled at rules set by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell limiting press access to the proceedings. Klobuchar criticized plans for "closed-door sessions and keeping things away from the press," adding, "I think that is outrageous."
U.S. Capitol security personnel forced Klobuchar and a Star Tribune reporter to move twice -- once from the Senate reception area and once from an anteroom adjacent to the Senate floor -- in order to speak.
Dozens of news organizations and several reporters' groups protested the access restrictions, which they said made politicians less accountable to their constituents.
Klobuchar and Sen. Tina Smith, the state's junior Democratic senator, also joined the debate over GOP efforts to restrict testimony by administration witnesses. As she entered the chamber at the trial's start, Klobuchar, a former prosecutor, said the "real debate" was about the right to call witnesses. Noting that she never prosecuted a case where she wanted less evidence, Klobuchar said Trump's attempts to block witnesses and documents from impeachment investigators and jurors is unprecedented.
"When you have a trial," she said, "you have witnesses and you have documents."
Meanwhile in Iowa, a team of surrogates comprised of family and political allies will step in for Klobuchar at campaign events all over the state. Her daughter, Abigail Bessler, was scheduled to host "Hotdish House Parties" at private homes in Stanton and Iowa City on Tuesday and Wednesday. Leading Minnesota Democrats, including U.S. Reps. Angie Craig and Dean Phillips, Gov. Tim Walz and Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan are likely to show up in Iowa on Klobuchar's behalf.
"I'm not going to be able to come back for a while," Klobuchar said Monday night at a town hall in Mason City, her last scheduled stop in the state for the time being. Klobuchar told the crowd of about 150 likely caucusgoers that she's "asking for your understanding and consideration. I have a constitutional duty. It is my job to be one of 100 jurors."
While Klobuchar, Warren and Sanders remain trapped in Washington, former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg both have multiple Iowa events in upcoming days.
"There's no question it hurts candidates who can't be here," said David Yepsen, a longtime political journalist and analyst who now hosts a politics show on Iowa public television. "We're in the endgame of this campaign, and if you're a candidate, you're here firing up your workers, you're getting in your last licks, you're making your closing argument to whoever will listen."
The impeachment trial also could blunt the tailwind of several influential newspaper endorsements that landed last weekend. Iowa's Quad City Times, one of the state's biggest dailies, endorsed Klobuchar after backing Sanders in 2016; and the New York Times took the unusual step of endorsing both Klobuchar and Warren: Klobuchar as the best representative of the party's moderate wing, and Warren as the torchbearer of the party's progressives.
"There's a bit of momentum underway," said Iowa state Rep. Chris Hall of Sioux City, who had initially backed former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke. "It was exciting for us to read those New York Times and Quad City Times endorsements. It was a great reflection of what we're seeing and hearing about Senator Klobuchar."
While Klobuchar's hopes run first through Iowa, she's also finding she can't ignore other early states. A group of New Hampshire elected officials who endorsed Klobuchar held a similar news conference in Concord on Tuesday.
Patty Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor who's neutral in this year's Democratic contest, said if Klobuchar and her campaign have laid the groundwork properly, her physical absence shouldn't sink her chances.
"Amy Klobuchar, like Warren and Sanders, they've all been running around this state nearly every weekend for the last year," Judge said. "I believe if you wanted to meet Amy Klobuchar before today, you have had a chance to do that. You have most likely had the opportunity to do that more than once."

Trump's no 'prophet' on climate change

Texto completo: President Donald Trump rightly touted "America's extraordinary prosperity" in his speech at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday. But his history of overlooking the global component of that success is wrongheaded, especially because transnational threats can reverse the uninterrupted U.S. economic growth that began during the Obama era.
Chief among these threats is climate change, which the president has previously called a hoax. He didn't go that far in Davos, but he did decry the "perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse."
No, conditions aren't apocalyptic. (Unless you're a kangaroo in Australia's wildfires -- or if not Down Under, down south in coastal U.S. states that are requesting billions in aid to mitigate the impact of climate change while never mentioning the term, according to a New York Times analysis of the requests).
A more adult reckoning came from 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg, who told the gathered elites in Davos that "the facts are clear, but they're still too uncomfortable for you to address." That alacrity was amplified by a more august source, 81-year-old WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who said that "the world is in a state of emergency and the window to act is closing fast."
States of emergency are possible because of other transnational threats, too. Responding to them multilaterally is much more effective, especially in cases like pandemics (possibly including the coronavirus China is straining to contain), as well as the borderless scourge of terrorism. Trump will meet with Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish leaders in Davos, but his "America First" foreign policy that's led to the abrogation of climate, nuclear and trade accords undermines U.S. security.
This includes the economic security that undergirds everything else. It's welcome news that the administration reached a "phase one" trade deal with China, and that in the midst of Washington's gridlock an accord between the U.S., Mexico and Canada was passed on a bipartisan basis.
The progress on trade -- as well as fiscal stimulus from 49 central banks -- was among factors cited Monday by the International Monetary Fund as it predicted global growth of 3.3% in 2020, up from last year's 2.9%. But IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva also noted ominous echoes of a previous era. "The beginning of this decade [has been] eerily reminiscent of the 1920s -- high inequality, rapid spread of technology and huge risks and rewards in finance," Georgieva said. "For the analogy to stop right there and go no further, acting together in a coordinated way is absolutely critical."
Trump's triumphal tone at the Alpine resort came amid a mountain of evidence that he engaged in the wrong kind of internationalism -- leveraging Ukraine's government to interfere in the U.S. election. The impeachment trial that began Tuesday is not a "hoax," as the president again mischaracterized it in Davos. For Congress, it's a constitutional duty.
Indeed, good governance and the rule of law are the roots of the economic strength Trump talked about in Davos.

As Trump says injuries suffered by US troops in Iranian attack are 'not serious,' Pentagon offers few details

Texto completo: President Trump appeared to express a new openness to revamping entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare in an interview aired Wednesday, potentially opening the door to overhauling two of America's largest government programs if he is elected to a second term.
Speaking with CNBC from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said tackling entitlement spending is "the easiest of all things" and seemed to suggest higher economic growth would make it easier to reduce spending on those programs. It was unclear exactly what changes the president was envisioning and the White House did not immediately respond to a request to clarify.
"At the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look," Trump said. He later added when asked about entitlements: "Well, we're going — we're going look. We also have — assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this."
It was unclear what Trump was referring to when he mentioned unprecedented growth. The economy is growing but not as fast as it has in the past, though the stock market is at record levels.
Adding to the confusion are private remarks Trump recently made that appeared to dismiss the importance of the budget deficit, which has ballooned to about $1 trillion a year under his administration.
Trump as a 2016 presidential candidate promised not to cut Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security, a position typically more in line with Democratic lawmakers that set him apart from the rest of the GOP field. His budget proposals as president, however, have called for slight reductions in Medicare and bigger changes to Medicaid spending. He is also seeking curbs to Social Security disability programs but he has not pursued changes to Social Security benefits for older Americans.
Washington Post
Trump says injuries minor for soldiers in Iran attack
President Trump addressed injuries suffered by US troops in Iran's recent ballistic missile attack on Wednesday, saying he that can "report it is not very serious" and that defense officials told him about them days after the fact.
"I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things," he said. "But I would say, and I can report it is not very serious. Not very serious."
The comments came after the Pentagon acknowledged Tuesday evening that more US service members have been removed from Iraq for treatment and testing after suffering from concussion-like symptoms caused by the Jan. 8 attack on Al Asad Air Base in Iraq, in which 11 ballistic missiles caused deep craters and charred wreckage.
Trump and defense officials initially said that no one was injured, but the Pentagon reported last week that 11 service members had left on flights to receive follow-up treatment. Defense officials said Tuesday that even more had left, but declined to say how many or address questions about whether anyone has been sent back to the United States.
Air Force Major General Alex Grynkewich, a senior commander for the US mission in Iraq and Syria, told reporters outside Washington on Wednesday that the injured were "looked at for TBI," an acronym for traumatic brain injury that can range from a mild concussion to something more serious.
The Pentagon considers TBI to be a signature wound of the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and acknowledges that some can be debilitating. More than 313,800 service members have suffered one in combat or training, according to a Defense Department fact sheet.
Washington Post
Sanders, Biden swap top spots in two national pollsA new national poll shows Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont with a lead in a national debate qualifying poll for the first time in the 2020 Democratic primary, while a second national survey shows former vice president Joe Biden in front.
The first poll, conducted by SSRS for CNN and released Wednesday morning, showed Sanders with 27 percent support and Biden following closely behind at 24 percent support. It was the first time Sanders has led nationally since Biden entered the race in April, though his lead was within the poll's margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The second poll, released later by Monmouth University, showed a different picture, with Biden in the lead at 30 percent support and Sanders in second with 23 percent. In both polls, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts finished third with 14 percent support.
Former mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York traded places in the polls, with Buttigieg coming in fourth in CNN's poll with 11 percent and fifth in Monmouth's with 6 percent, and Bloomberg finishing fourth in Monmouth's with 9 percent and fifth in CNN's with 5 percent.
No other candidate garnered more than 5 percent support in either of the polls.
Sanders has shown particular signs of strength in some early-state polls, leading a highly anticipated poll of Iowa caucusgoers conducted by The Des Moines Register/CNN and a CBS/YouGov tracking poll of New Hampshire primary voters, both released this month.

Texto completo: The company behind the hit true-crime podcast "Serial" is exploring a sale, according to a person familiar with the matter, putting one of digital audio's biggest brands on the market as the medium becomes increasingly popular.
Serial Productions is best known for producing "Serial," a podcast that tells a new multipart series every season. Its first season garnered more than 300 million downloads.
Among the potential buyers for Serial Productions is New York Times Co., the person said. A deal could accelerate the growth of the Times's audio division. The revenue and potential valuation of Serial Productions wasn't clear, but any transaction would likely be small for the Times or another major media company.
Representatives of Serial Productions didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the New York Times declined to comment.
Several media companies have looked to bulk up on podcasting as it has exploded in popularity. Audiostreaming giant Spotify Technology SA last year purchased narrative-audio company Gimlet Media for more than $200 million and is in early talks to buy sports and pop-culture company The Ringer, which produces more than 30 podcasts, The Wall Street Journal reported last week . Radio giant iHeartMedia Inc. purchased Stuff Media for about $55 million in 2018.
U.S. podcast advertising revenue was about $678 million in 2019, according to projections from research firm eMarketer, a fraction of the $129.34 billion spent on digital ads. But the sector is expanding quickly and has more than doubled in revenue since 2017, according to data from the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Serial Productions was launched in 2017 by Sarah Koenig, Julie Snyder and Ira Glass, colleagues at "This American Life." The company is co-owned by its founders. Ms. Koenig hosts and is an executive producer of "Serial," which debuted in 2014 as a spinoff of "This American Life."
"Serial" is widely credited with helping to popularize the podcasting format. The success of the first season, which explored the murder conviction of Baltimore County, Md., teenager Adnan Syed, inspired other true-crime shows. The other seasons, which debuted in 2015 and 2018, were about the desertion of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl and the Cleveland criminal-justice system, respectively.
Serial Productions has also produced "S-Town," a multipart podcast that examines the circumstances surrounding the death of horologist John B. McLemore. This American Life and Serial together are the 11th-largest podcast publisher by audience, with over 5 million monthly listeners, according to research firm Podtrac.
The New York Times is the fourth-largest podcast publisher by audience, with over 10 million monthly listeners in the U.S., according to Podtrac. The company's big hit is "The Daily," a newsy podcast that launched in 2017 and is distributed every weekday. It has been downloaded more than a billion times, according to the Times, and is among the most popular podcasts in the U.S. by audience.
The Times' audio division, which now has more than 30 producers and editors, has added podcasts about politics, ISIS and the legacy of slavery in the U.S. The Times doesn't disclose detailed financials for its audio operations, but says that the company generates advertising and licensing revenue from its podcasts.

Texto completo: It's not often that the New York Times makes President Trump sound better than he is, so perhaps today's dispatch from Washington is suitable for framing. The good news is that the United States may finally have a President who is interested in restraining federal spending. But he might not be as interested as the Times says he is.
Here's the headline on a Times report from Alan Rappeport and Maggie Haberman:
Trump Opens Door to Cuts to Medicare and Other Entitlement Programs; The president signaled a willingness to scale back Medicare, a shift from his 2016 platform of protecting welfare programs.
For taxpayers hoping for relief from a government that spent nearly $4.5 trillion in the most recent fiscal year and expects to spend almost $4.7 trillion in the current one, that headline is bound to inspire giddiness, if not euphoria. Below the headline, the story appears to contain more good news:
President Trump suggested on Wednesday that he would be willing to consider cuts to social safety-net programs like Medicare to reduce the federal deficit if he wins a second term, an apparent shift from his 2016 campaign promise to protect funding for such entitlements.... Asked in an interview with CNBC if cuts to entitlements would ever be on his plate, Mr. Trump answered yes... Mr. Trump suggested that curbing spending on Medicare, the government health care program for the elderly, was a possibility.
"We're going to look," he said.
There has never been a better time for a President to care about such things, because the U.S. Treasury recently reported that the U.S. is returning to the Obama-era habit of running trillion-dollar annual federal budget deficits.
And there is no better place to look for taxpayer savings than the mandatory spending programs that now consume 70% of the federal budget and, absent reform, are destined to drive monumental spending increases in the years to come.
A recent report from the Congressional Budget Office gave Congress a menu of options for restraining the disturbing growth in federal debt. Nearly all of the options for generating large savings are entitlement reforms.
But this column regrets to inform taxpayers that we need to curb our enthusiasm about Mr. Trump's eagerness to embrace reform. That's because the President's interview on CNBC, while encouraging, was not exactly as the Times describes it.
The disappointing detail is that while the President and CNBC's Joe Kernen discussed a review of entitlement programs, neither participant in the discussion ever actually mentioned cutting or curbing. Here's the relevant exchange from the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland:
JOE KERNEN: Entitlements ever be on your plate?
PRESIDENT TRUMP: At some point they will be. We have tremendous growth. We're going to have tremendous growth. This next year I-- it'll be toward the end of the year. The growth is going to be incredible. And at the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that's actually the easiest of all things, if you look, cause it's such a--
JOE KERNEN: If you're willing--
PRESIDENT TRUMP: --big percentage.
JOE KERNEN: --to do some of the things that you said you wouldn't do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare--
PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we're going-- we're going to look. We also have-- assets that we've never had. I mean we've never had growth like this. We never had a consumer that was taking in, through-- different means, over $10,000 a family. We never had the kind of-- the kind of things that we have. Look, our country is the hottest in the world. We have the hottest economy in the world. We have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. African American, Asian American. Hispanics are doing so incredibly. Best they've ever done. Black. Best they've ever done. African American. The numbers are incredible. The poverty numbers. The unemployment and the employment. There's-- there is a difference, actually. But the unemployment and employment numbers for African Americans are the best we've ever had.
Even if Mr. Trump still hasn't committed to being any more responsible than his predecessors at protecting the federal fisc, he seems to be implying that he's at least up for considering reform. So let's hope that this is one Times prediction that turns out to be true!
As for something we can confidently expect to occur in 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice seems determined to find out how the government's surveillance powers were abused in investigations of Trump campaign associates in 2016. In another interview in Davos, Mr. Trump tells Maria Bartiromo of the Fox Business Network that he thinks the problem went "right to the top."

Texto completo: BOSTON — The New England First Amendment Coalition will honor Hearst Connecticut Media with its 2020 Michael Donoghue Freedom of Information Award for its project on sexual abuse cases tied to Boys & Girls Clubs across the country, the organization announced Wednesday.
The FOI Award is presented annually to New England journalists who protect or advance the public’s right to know under federal or state law. A committee of First Amendment Coalition board members chooses the FOI Award recipient based solely on merit, the organization said in a release.
“The committee was very impressed with the work done for the Boys & Girls Club investigation and believed the series to be deserving of the honor,” said Justin Silverman, executive director of the coalition.

FAQ: Boys & Girls Clubs and sexual abuse
A team of seven journalists at Hearst Connecticut spent more than six months digging through 1,600 pages of public documents and filing more than 100 public record requests. They found more than 100 cases of abuse involving 280 victims in 31 states over the course of 70 years tied to Boys & Girls Clubs of America affiliates.
The Hearst staff used the documents it obtained to create a public database that allows parents sending a child to a local Boys & Girls Club to look up information about incidents and how they were handled by the organization.
“Having their work acknowledged in this way is a testament to the expertise and unwavering determination with which this team of adept journalists carried out this vitally important investigation,” said Wendy Metcalfe, VP of content and editor-in-chief for Hearst Connecticut. “Not only did they fight for the public’s right to know, they brought significant change on both a local and national level, which will have a long-lasting impact helping children.”
As a result of the reporting, Boys & Girls Clubs of America — which oversees 4,600 local affiliates — announced it will hire a third-party firm to review how it responds to complaints related to abuse and will provide additional safety training to its staff. Another youth organization also announced it would end all overnight visits between children and mentors as a result of Hearst Connecticut’s investigation into Boys & Girls Clubs.
“Local journalism can have big impact,” said Lisa Yanick Litwiller, the lead editor on the investigation. “We saw a need in our communities and across the country and we recognized our responsibility as journalists to shine a light on the issue wherever we found it. We are honored to be recognized for the intense, rewarding work of holding power to account.”
Hearst Connecticut staff members who worked on the project — Litwiller, Hannah Dellinger, Viktoria Sundqvist, Meghan Friedmann, Peter Yankowski, Humberto J. Rocha and Tatiana Flowers — will be honored Feb. 7 at NEFAC’s 10th annual awards luncheon at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront Hotel. During the luncheon, A.G. Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times, will also be honored with the Stephen Hamblett First Amendment Award.
Previous recipients of the FOI Award are the Hartford Courant (2019); Todd Wallack of The Boston Globe (2018); The Sun Journal in Lewiston, Maine (2017); Jenifer McKim of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting (2016); James W. Foley (posthumously), the war correspondent and New Hampshire native killed by the Islamic State (2015); Brent Curtis of the Rutland Herald in Vermont (2014); and Don Stacom of the Hartford Courant (2013).

The Chinese population crisis

Texto completo: In recent days both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have carried reports on one of the most important geopolitical facts of the 21st century: The world's great rising power, the People's Republic of China, is headed for a demographic crisis.
Like the United States and most developed countries, China has a birthrate that is well below replacement level. Unlike most developed countries, China is growing old without first having grown rich.
Of course China has grown richer: My colleague David Leonhardt, who spent time in China at the beginning and the end of the 2010s, just wrote a column emphasizing the "maturing" of the Chinese economy over that period, the growth of startups, and consumer spending and the middle class.
But even after years of growth, Chinese per capita gross domestic product is still about one-third or one-fourth the size of neighboring countries like South Korea and Japan. And yet its birthrate has converged with the rich world much more quickly and completely - which has two interrelated implications, both of them grim.
First, China will have to pay for the care of a vast elderly population without the resources available to richer societies facing the same challenge. Second, China's future growth prospects will dim with every year of below-replacement birthrates because low fertility creates a self-reinforcing cycle in which a less youthful society loses dynamism and growth, which reduces economic support for would-be parents, which reduces birthrates, which reduces growth 
The Times' report on China's birthrates also reminds us that this trap is cultural, quoting a young Chinese woman who remarks of her one-child-policy-shaped generation, "We are all only children, and to be honest, a little selfish  How can I raise a child when I'm still a child myself?" This is the glib explication of a real problem: Having kids, inevitably one of the harder things that humans do, feels harder still in a society where children are invisible, siblings absent, and large families rare; where there aren't ready exemplars or forms of solidarity for people contemplating parenthood.
In all this, what China is experiencing is part of the common demographic decadence of the developed world, which is enveloping developing countries too. As Lyman Stone writes in the latest National Review, the human race is increasingly facing a "global fertility crisis," not just a European or American or Japanese baby bust. It's a crisis that threatens ever-slower growth in the best case; in the worst case, to cite a recent paper by Stanford economist Charles Jones, it risks "an Empty Planet result: knowledge and living standards stagnate for a population that gradually vanishes."
(An aside to answer a predictable objection: Yes, in an age of stagnation, CO2 levels won't grow as fast, delaying some of climate change's effects - but at the same time, a stagnant society will struggle to innovate enough to escape the climate crisis permanently. And yes, an empty planet wouldn't have a climate change problem at all, but if that's your goal, your misanthropy is terminal.)
Within this general, global story, though, the Chinese case is also distinctive because cruel policy choices made its demographic problems worse.
For these choices - the one-child policy and the forced abortions, sterilizations and infanticide the policy either required or encouraged - the Communist regime bears a heavy burden of guilt. And the guilt continues to build because even with the one-child policy gone, the regime's repression still effectively suppresses birthrates. As Stone noted recently on Twitter, by targeting minority and religious populations, Beijing is attacking the country's more fecund groups in what amounts to a statement that if Han birthrates have fallen, minority birthrates must be cut to match.
But alongside that Communist guilt, there is Western guilt as well because the one-child policy was linked to a project hatched by Western technocrats, funded by Western institutions and egged on by Western intellectuals - a classist, sexist, racist, anti-religious program that sought to defuse a "population bomb" that, we know now, would have defused itself without forced sterilization programs in India and signs in Chinese villages saying "You can beat it out! You can make it fall out! You can abort it! But you cannot give birth to it!"
That last quote comes from Mara Hvistendahl's gripping "Unnatural Selection," one of two books I recommend reading on the subject; the other is Matthew Connelly's "Fatal Misconception." Both are mostly retrospective: The Western effort died away as the population bomb fizzled, and while its Malthusianism endures around the edges of environmentalism and in European anxieties about African migration, mostly the population control crusade is recalled as a mistaken extrapolation, a well-meaning mistake.
But the news from China is a reminder that a harsher sort of memory is appropriate. As we contemplate the demographic challenge of the future, we should reserve particular opprobrium for those who chose, in the arrogance of their supposed humanitarianism, to use coercive and foul means to make the great problem of the 21st century worse.

Think coconut oil is good for your health? Here's what the experts are saying

Texto completo: New research on the health affects of coconut oil adds to concerns about its link to cardiovascular disease.
In a new meta-analysis, published in the American Heart Association's peer-reviewed journal Circulation, researchers reviewed 16 studies about how bodies react after eating coconut oil. They found that, according to the studies they evaluated, coconut oil significantly increased LDL ("bad") cholesterol by about 9% compared with nontropical vegetable oils. HDL ("good") cholesterol also increased.
"There is no evidence from medical studies that coconut oil is beneficial for health. In fact, high consumption of coconut oil increases LDL-cholesterol levels . . . which is likely to increase risk of heart disease," said study author Rob M. van Dam of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at National University of Singapore. The Singapore Ministry of Health paid for the analysis.
Donald Hensrud, director of the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program who is unaffiliated with the analysis, told USA TODAY the new data “strengthened the case that coconut oil is not the panacea” or cure-all that some people have claimed.
What is coconut oil?
Coconut oil is fat that comes from pressing coconut meat or dried coconut meat (copra). More than 80% of that fat is saturated fat — far beyond butter (63%), beef fat (50%) and pork lard (39%), according to the AHA. Virgin coconut oil is the least processed of available varieties.
Is coconut oil a health food?
Coconut oil has been marketed as a health food for several years. Low-carb, high-fat weight loss diets, including the keto diet, favor coconut oil, claiming it can help bust belly fat by inducing ketosis. Back in 2016, The New York Times asked people whether coconut oil is healthy and 72% said yes, but medical experts say there's largely no good scientific data that backs up health claims.
In 2018, a Harvard professor called coconut oil “pure poison,” saying it’s one of the “worst foods you can eat. " While it's not poison, most medical experts say it's not a health food.
“I don't think that we need to fear it or take it out of the diet completely, but there's no need to be using it in excess or as the only oil in the diet,” said Ginger Hultin, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.
A tablespoon of coconut oil is about equal to the amount of saturated fat adults should eat in one day, according to AHA recommendations. The World Health Organization also recommends limiting saturated fats.
"Until we get some good evidence, we should be suspect of claims that something is healthy," Hensrud said.
Does coconut oil cause heart disease, stroke?
The AHA has advised avoiding coconut oil for years, saying in a 2017 advisory about cardiovascular disease that the oil “has no known offsetting favorable effects” and could increase risk of heart attack and stroke. It has held the same position on saturated fats for more than 30 years.
Some critics have challenged these longstanding dietary guidelines, questioning recommendations to limit eating saturated fat-rich foods including coconut oil, which also has antioxidant properties and increases HDL ("good") cholesterol.
In 2014, the journal Annals of Internal Medicine published controversial research suggesting people who ate an increased amount of saturated fat did not have more heart disease than those who ate less. A 2015 BMJ review reported people who cut saturated fat might fill the void with sugar and empty calories, which could also cause health problems.
Most doctors say for heart health, advocating coconut oil use can be dangerous. When looking for an oil to use in cooking, those with high levels of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats that lower cholesterol are preferred.
Olive oil, avocado oil: These are the oils you should be using, experts say

Texto completo: This lends itself to way more questions than answers, a friend of mine wrote on Facebook the other day above a weird photo.
It showed three boxes of Imodium A-D, that trusted anti-diarrhea medication, lying crumpled in a parking lot. What nightmarish emergency, he wondered, could have possibly led to this?
Turns out, it was nightmarish. Just not in the way most of us would think.
A few commenters on the post explained what was probably going on: People battling opioid withdrawal sometimes gobble Imodium by the fistful.
Imodium is the brand-name of loperamide: a drug that, if taken in gigantic quantities, can produce an opioid-like high – and present serious dangers to a person's health.
According to U.S. News & World Report, the U.S. National Poison Data System reported a 90% spike in loperamide overdoses between 2010 and 2016.
Abusing the drug can, naturally, lead to horrific constipation. But it can also wreak havoc on your heart – usually through irregular heartbeats, the New York Times reported in 2016.
"Most physicians just recently realized loperamide could be abused, and few look for it," the story read. "There is little if any national data on the problem, but many toxicologists and emergency department doctors suspect that it is more widespread than scattered reports suggest."
In September, the FDA stepped in and announced it would limit Imodium A-D, Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief and Be Health Loperamide HCI capsules – as well as their generic offshoots – to 48 milligrams per package, or about 24 capsules per box. The maximum daily dosage is eight milligrams.
"Abuse of loperamide continues in the United States and taking higher than recommended doses can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death," acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in the release.
But the FDA isn't going to come crashing through pharmacy windows if stores don't follow those guidelines. The new rules are nothing more than voluntary.
That becomes pretty clear if you take a stroll through a local pharmacy.
Battling dirty looks from pharmacy workers and customers alike, I scoped out several stores around Evansville and found a variety of anti-diarrhea displays.
Some kept Imodium locked in clear plastic cases. Others sported cage-free boxes that held as much as 96 milligrams per package.
I suppose you could rant about how all this is a sign of a deteriorating culture. I can't even buy diarrhea medication anymore without feeling like a drug addict!
The saddest part for me, though, is that people feel they have to resort to this. I hope whoever left those crumpled boxes behind can find the help they need to kick their addiction.

Jimmy Heath: 1926-2020

Texto completo: Jimmy Heath, a Grammy-nominated jazz saxophonist and composer who performed with such greats as Miles Davis and John Coltrane before forming the popular family group the Heath Brothers in middle age, has died. He was 93.
Heath's grandson, Fa Mtume, told The New York Times that he died Sunday at his home in Loganville, Georgia. The cause of death was not immediately given.
Heath, a native of Philadelphia, had been playing jazz since the 1940s, in the early days of bebop. He was mentored by Dizzy Gillespie, idolized Charlie Parker, whose nickname was "Bird," and would become known as "Little Bird" for how well he emulated Parker's fluid style.
Heath played often in Chicago, usually at the Jazz Showcase, a club founded by impresario Joe Segal, who grew up with Heath in the rich Philadelphia jazz scene that also nurtured John Coltrane, McCoy Tyner, Benny Golson, Jimmy Smith, Shirley Scott and others.
When Heath appeared at the Showcase in 2011, leading the Heath Brothers Quartet (with sibling and drummer Albert "Tootie" Heath), the saxophonist performed as part of the club's annual "August is Charlie Parker Month" festivities.
The large audience prompted Tribune critic Howard Reich to observe, "Jimmy Heath's copious recording history over the last half-century-plus, as well as his luminous writing for large ensemble, earns him admiration from a sophisticated audience before he plays a single note."
The show attested to Heath's breadth of imagination as composer-arranger, for it included a singularly translucent version of the "On the Trail" section of Ferde Grofe's "Grand Canyon Suite," as well as ethereal accounts of music by Billy Strayhorn and Jimmy Dorsey.
When Heath led big bands in the Chicago area, there was no mistaking the ingenuity and idiosyncrasy of his writing.
Heath overcame his battles with heroin addiction, which landed him in prison in the mid-1950s, and had a long and productive career. He wrote most of the material for the Chet Baker-Art Pepper album "Playboys," recorded with everyone from Davis and Coltrane to Milt Jackson and Gil Evans, worked on charts for Ray Charles, and released several of his own albums.
In the 1970s, he helped found the Heath Brothers, which also featured brothers Percy Heath on bass and Albert "Tootie" Heath on drums. Their albums included "Marchin' On" and the Grammy-nominated "Live at the Public Theater." In 1993, he received a Grammy nomination for his own "Little Man, Big Band" album (Heath stood just 5 feet, 3 inches) and played in a jazz concert at the White House, when President Bill Clinton himself borrowed his saxophone for one number.
In 2003, he was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, which noted that "By combining his versatile style of performing and his outstanding writing and arranging abilities, he has set a high standard of accomplishment in the jazz field."
Survivors include Tootie Heath; his second wife, Mona; and a child from each of his marriages. His son from his first marriage, James Mtume, became a Grammy-winning musician and songwriter who helped write the Stephanie Mills hit "Never Knew Love Like This Before." Another son, Jeffrey, died in 2010. Percy Heath died in 2005.

My mixed feelings about New York Times endorsement's mixed message

Texto completo: Fittingly enough, I'm of two minds about The New York Times' controversial "we're of two minds ..." endorsement editorial.
After conducting extensive interviews with the leading Democratic presidential contenders in advance of the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, the newspaper's editorial board on Sunday night gave its nod to both Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
Critics pounced. C'mon, Times! Yanny or Laurel? Paper or plastic? Chiefs or 49ers? Boxers or briefs? Marvel or DC? Tastes great or less filling? Take a stand already!
I took the point. The failure to choose and defend one candidate over all others felt like a betrayal of the board's mission to make definitive pronouncements on the important issues of the day based on the values it has long espoused.
And the anointing of two candidates -- Warren from what the editorial referred to as the Democrats' "radical" faction and Klobuchar from the "realist" faction -- had a whiff of cowardice, as though the Times didn't want to offend either side in this intraparty battle for the nomination.
On the other hand, the 3,432-word editorial did effectively identify, analyze and referee the two distinct tournament brackets in the Democratic field, brackets that amount to separate primarylike battles for the coveted "tickets out of Iowa."
The candidates who win, do well enough or sufficiently exceed expectations among the progressive and moderate wings of the party will earn viability in the New Hampshire primary eight days later.
It's common for newspaper editorial boards to offer endorsements in both Democratic and Republican primary races for the same office. And given the split in the 2020 Democratic field in Iowa between the left and the center, the Times' decision to endorse one from each makes a certain amount of sense at this point in the contest.
If you're a committed lefty, the editorial makes the case that you should be favoring Warren over Sen. Bernie Sanders.
If you consider yourself a moderate Democrat, the editorial argues that Klobuchar is preferable to former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and others.
One passage in the editorial sums up just about every conversation I've had with my fellow dithering Democrats in the last few months: "If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it."
I see this as at once profoundly equivocal and unequivocally profound.
It's a conflicted editorial for a conflicted moment in time. Real endorsement to follow.
I am certain of one thing, though. If there were ever a time to strip Iowa and New Hampshire of their primacy in choosing presidential candidates, now is it.
Current U.S. census estimates tell us that Iowa's population is 85% white, 6.2% Hispanic and 3.5% African American. New Hampshire's population is 90% white, 3.9% Hispanic and 1.7% African American. Meanwhile, the nation itself is 60.4% white, 18.3% Hispanic and 13.4% African American.
And yes, victory in Iowa propelled African American Democrat Barack Obama to the nomination and then the White House in 2008, but there remains value in having voters in a more demographically representative state have the first crack at winnowing the field.
Illinois, anyone? Our demographics -- 61% white, 17.4% Hispanic and 14.6% African American -- come very close to mirroring the country as a whole, and our economy could really use the boost of all the campaign activity that attends these first-in-the-nation events.
Only one Democratic hopeful this cycle made a stink about the death grip that Iowa and New Hampshire have on the primary process. "It's really about reflecting the values that we say we have as Democrats where everybody has a place at the table," he said. The party is "making the mistake of putting our nominating contest in the hands of two states that hardly have any black people, or hardly have any people of color." He called it "hypocrisy."
That was former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, who dropped out Jan. 2 when it was clear his candidacy had no traction.
Other candidates have not wanted to risk endorsing the idea that the Democratic Party ought to shake up the order next time, a position bound to offend the very voters who will soon decide their fate.
For example, when a radio host put the question about primary order to Warren at a candidate forum in November, her response was defensive astonishment: "Are you actually going to ask me to sit here and criticize Iowa and New Hampshire?" she said, adding, "I'm just a player in the game on this one."
Talk about shrinking from taking a stand.

After 10 years, 'New Jim Crow' still has much to say about race and injustice

Texto completo: Every so often a book comes along that shakes up the national gabfest in a way that makes all of us talk about an old problem with a new urgency.
Jane Jacobs' 1961 book "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" sparked a movement to preserve urban neighborhood diversity against developers' bulldozers.
Michael Harrington's 1962 "The Other America: Poverty in the United States" helped spur President Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty."
Rachel Carson's 1962 "Silent Spring" gave flight to what became the environmental preservation movement.
Now 10 years have passed since another breakthrough book shook up the criminal justice debate: legal scholar Michelle Alexander's "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness."
Since hers was hardly the first study to claim racial bias in our nation's criminal justice system, she recalls in an essay that she wrote for the book's 10th anniversary edition, a lot of people told her not to expect much reaction. Instead, the book climbed the New York Times bestseller list, where it remained for nearly 250 weeks.
A decade later, it is easier to look back and see what made this book stand out -- and ignite another debate, even as states like Illinois expunge thousands of minor drug convictions. With ample statistics and historical narratives, she gave voice to what many people had long suspected, especially in black communities. The surge in black incarceration that followed decades of wars on drugs had become, whether by accident or design, a "new Jim Crow," she argued, metaphorically resembling the original version of racial segregation banned by the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
The nation's criminal justice system uses the war on drugs to enforce forms of racial discrimination, oppression and "social control" that most of us thought had gone away with the hard-won victories of the civil rights era.
For this, she has received some scholarly pushback, even from those who share her concern for racially disproportional incarceration rates. In his book "Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration and How to Achieve Real Reform," John Pfaff, a Fordham University law professor, argues that Alexander makes too much of the statistics for drug offenders, since they make up only a small part of the prison population -- and nonviolent drug offenders an even smaller part.
Most prisoners have been convicted of violent crimes, he points out, and most American prisoners are in county and state justice systems, not the federal system.
Indeed, the federal system houses 221,000 inmates, compared with 1.3 million in state prisons and 612,000 in local jails, according to the Prison Policy Initiative in 2019.
Although the proportion of state prisoners whose primary crime was a drug offense rose sharply from 1980 to 1990, when it peaked at 22%, Pfaff writes, that leaves about four-fifths who were found guilty of some other offense. By 2010, it fell to 17%. Bottom line, says the statistics expert: Reducing the incarceration of drug offenders will not do much to reduce prison populations.
Other scholars have made similar claims. Jonathan Rothwell, a Brookings Institution senior fellow, tries nobly to reconcile the differences by comparing the time and length of sentences for different crimes. Drug crimes have been the predominant reason for new admissions into state and federal prisons in recent decades, but those offenders tend to serve shorter sentences than those convicted of violent crimes.
"Rolling back the war on drugs would not totally solve the problem of mass incarceration," he writes, "but it could help a great deal, by reducing exposure to prison."
That makes sense. So do a number of black community residents who would like to see tougher law enforcement. The get-tough approach is much less popular now. That helps to explain why former Vice President Joe Biden seemed to be caught in a time warp as he tried to defend his support of the get-tough 1994 crime law that Alexander blames for making the mass incarceration problem worse.
As some of us remember, that bill was supported by a lot of black folks, including the Congressional Black Caucus, although with some reservations as they called for other reforms too.
But today, years after the totally unexpected crime drop in the mid-1990s, more people of all races are asking questions about the role race plays in our justice system. After all, crack cocaine, primarily a plague in black communities, was treated as a crime problem. Opioid abuse, more closely identified with poor white communities, has been treated as a public health problem.
Racial disparities like that are not easily brushed off as coincidence. Nor should they be. Instead, they help to explain the popularity of Alexander's book.

Texto completo: Numbers have long held a special significance at Google.
When the internet company was founded in 1998, it based its name on the mathematical term "googol" -- the numeral 1 followed by 100 zeros.
When it filed to go public in 2004, it said it planned to raise $2,718,281,828, which was the sum of multiplying $1 billion with the mathematical constant "e."
And in 2015 when it reorganized under a parent entity called Alphabet, it announced it would buy back shares worth $5,099,019,513.59, a figure derived from the square root of 26 -- the number of letters in the alphabet.
Last week, Google hit another eye-popping number. The market cap of Alphabet vaulted above $1 trillion for the first time. That made it the fourth technology company -- after Apple, Amazon and Microsoft over the past two years -- to pass this once unimaginable valuation.
"So proud to see it hit the storied $1T market cap today!" Marissa Mayer, a former Google executive, said in a tweet that prematurely celebrated the Monday milestone. She said she remembered when Google had raised money at a $100 million valuation in 1999, the year she became employee No. 20.
Google reached its latest numerical milestone as it is facing some of its biggest tests. The Silicon Valley giant is bidding adieu to its founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, whose love of math and disregard for Wall Street once embodied Google's free spirit. Page and Brin, both 46, said last month that they would step down from their executive roles.
As part of the transition, Sundar Pichai, a longtime deputy who has been Google's chief executive since 2015, took the reins of what has been a changing company. While Page and Brin once said Google was not a conventional corporation, it has become just that in recent years.
Google has brought on professional managers like Ruth Porat, its chief financial officer, who joined from Wall Street in 2015. It also increasingly paid attention to curbing costs and monitoring the financial viability of its so-called moonshot projects, like self-driving cars or hot-air balloons that provide internet connectivity.
Google has also crammed more advertising onto the top of search results and squeezed money out of businesses like YouTube. And it has pushed aggressively into wooing corporate customers for its cloud computing business, putting it into the kind of lucrative but boring business that early Googlers once sneered at.
All the while, Google's unique and freewheeling corporate culture appears to be crumbling. Activist employees have complained that Google is cracking down on workers who speak out on issues such as the company's treatment of sexual harassment or working with the U.S. military on technology that could be used to improve weapons.
Last year, Google fired several employees active in labor organizing for what it described as "clear and repeated violations of our data security policies." It has also been working with a firm known for helping companies fend off unions.
Google faces other challenges. Regulators and lawmakers around the world are scrutinizing the company for vacuuming up people's private information and chilling the technology landscape with its market dominance.
The company will also be under the spotlight this year with the U.S. presidential election. It has grappled with criticism over how it allows politicians to target specific audiences with digital ads, a practice it recently scaled back.

Texto completo: David Olney, an uncommonly thoughtful singer-songwriter whose music has been recorded by the likes of Linda Ronstadt and Steve Earle, died on Saturday after apparently having a heart attack while performing onstage in Seaside, Florida. He was 71.
His manager, Mary Sack, said Olney was pronounced dead at a hospital nearby. He had undergone surgery for a heart attack a decade ago.
Olney was stricken while performing at the annual 30A Songwriters Festival, held at venues in and around Seaside, on the Florida Panhandle's Gulf Coast.
"David was playing a song when he paused, said 'I'm sorry' and put his chin to his chest," Scott Miller, a singer-songwriter who was performing with him, said on Facebook. "He never dropped his guitar or fell off his stool. It was as easy and gentle as he was. We got him down and tried our best to revive him until the EMT's arrived."
Olney never had a hit single or won a Grammy Award, but in folk-rock and Americana circles, he is revered for his poetic sensibility and gruff-voiced storytelling, especially by his fellow songwriters, including his musical hero, Townes Van Zandt.
"Anytime anyone asks me who my favorite music writers are, I say Mozart, Lightnin' Hopkins, Bob Dylan and Dave Olney," Van Zandt wrote in the liner notes to Olney's 1991 album, "Roses." "Dave Olney is one of the best songwriters I've ever heard -- and that's true. I mean that from the heart."
Emmylou Harris has recorded several of Olney's songs, including "Deeper Well," which appeared on her Grammy-winning 1995 album, "Wrecking Ball." Other songs of his recorded by others include "Saturday Night and Sunday Morning" (Earle), "Women Cross the River" (Ronstadt) and "Queen Anne's Lace" (Del McCoury).
"David Olney tells marvelous stories, with characters who cling to the hope of enduring love, all the while crossing the deep divide into that long, dark night of the soul," Harris said in a statement on Olney's website.
Olney at times approached his richly imagined character studies from unusual if not implausible perspectives. His wryly titled "Hymn of Brays" was written from the point of view of the donkey that carried Jesus into Jerusalem. The ballad "Titanic" is told from the standpoint of the iceberg that sank the ship. Another song was about the Hall of Fame New York Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto.
"I have always read a lot," Olney explained in a 2014 interview for a roots music website. "Besides being a cheap source of entertainment, literature gives constant lessons in how to tell a story."
David Charles Olney was born on March 23, 1948, in Providence, Rhode Island. His father, Peter Butler Olney, worked as a manager in a cotton plant; his mother, Francis (Swift) Olney, taught elementary school.
The second of three children raised in Lincoln, Rhode Island, Olney had what he described as an "idyllic" childhood. At 15 he saw Ray Charles in concert and a year or so later, in 1964, was in the audience at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island when Bob Dylan made his first appearance there. David was 12 when he received his first guitar.
After high school he briefly pursued a degree in English at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he spent more time playing folk music in bars than studying.
Olney moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in the early 1970s and fell in with similarly literary-minded singer-songwriters like Van Zandt, Earle and Guy Clark. Later he formed Dave Olney & the X-Rays, a new wave-inspired rock band that released a pair of albums in the early '80s. The group also opened shows for Elvis Costello and appeared on the PBS series "Austin City Limits."
The X-Rays disbanded in 1985, after which Olney proceeded to release more than 20 albums, tour extensively and distinguish himself as a widely admired, if not quite famous, singer-songwriter.
He is survived by his wife of 30 years, Regine (Popp) Olney; a son, Redding; a daughter, Lillian Olney; a brother, Peter; and a sister, Debby Atwell.

Personalizing a weight-loss plan makes it yours

Texto completo: Would you still eat that candy bar if the label, in addition to noting the sweet morsel held 230 calories, including the fact that you'd need 42 minutes of walking or 22 minutes of running to burn them off?
The Associated Press asked a similar question in a recent story about the movement to improve food labeling so people might make better choices.
On the other side of that argument, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa told the AP that "the idea that exercise is a punishment for eating does not strike me as a good way to promote exercise or healthy attitudes around food" as opposed to "promoting environments where it's easier to make good choices."
Seems to me that an important element of making good choices is finding the right weight-loss program for you as an individual. The concept, called personalization, is based on the principle that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to dieting.
After all, if your pants fit you, you wear them. If they don't, you get rid of 'em. Why should weight loss be any different? Without personalization, a diet is a diet. With personalization, it becomes a habit and a lifestyle.
Last November, researchers from Harvard College and King's College in London presented early results of their new study that showed surprising outcomes about how individuals process fats and carbohydrates. As The New York Times put it: "how efficiently a person metabolized one micronutrient was no predictor of how that person might respond to another," even among twins.
The Times concluded that the ongoing study by 40 scientists around the world of 700 identical twins, 300 individual British volunteers and 100 from the U.S. pointed out that "the more important factors in how our bodies metabolize food, it seems are environmental: sleep, stress, exercise and the diversity and population of our individual gut microbiomes."
So what's a person to do? There's certainly no lack of diets out there and now there are even apps you can use.
How do you know what's right for you?
Those smart folks at the Mayo Clinic offer some tips that might help you make that decision:
Before you start a program, talk to your doctor about your medications, medical issues, how to exercise safely and previous diet programs you may have tried.
Know your goals and personal needs. What other diets worked for you or didn't? What did you like or hate about them? Are you looking to take this on by yourself or with others? Does cost fit your budget?
Evaluate the plans. What's involved? Is there research or science to back up the program? Are there risks? What outcomes can you expect?
Pick a plan or program you can live with.
Results don't happen overnight. You're making a lifestyle change, not just a change in what you eat or how often. Whatever choice you make, you need to embrace it for a lifetime, not fight it every day.
You'll know pretty quickly whether the plan or program is right for you. But don't give up if the first one – or the ninth one – doesn't' work.
Remember: you're doing this for your health and your life. I can't think of anything more important.

Texto completo: AZTEC – Candidates for Congressional District 3 and U.S. Senate are visiting San Juan County as the date approaches for the San Juan County Republican and Democratic parties' pre-primary conventions.
The Democratic county convention will be Jan. 25 and the Republican convention will be Jan. 30.
San Juan County Democratic Party Chairwoman MP Schildmeyer said the county's pre-primary convention involves selecting delegates. These delegates will attend the state pre-primary convention on March 7 and vote for candidates. Any candidate who receives 20% of the vote will automatically be included on the primary election ballot. The Republican state pre-primary convention will also be on March 7.
Republican Senate candidate participates in forum Republican candidate Elisa Martinez, who is running for U.S. Senate, visited San Juan County this week and stopped by the San Juan County Patriot's Jan. 16 meeting in Aztec. This allowed her to become a last-minute addition to a candidate forum, replacing Congressional District 3 candidate Alexis Johnson who was unable to make the forum due to a storm.
If elected, Martinez will be the first woman to serve as New Mexico's senator. She identifies as both Native American and Latina. She is an anti-abortion advocate who founded the New Mexico Alliance for Life.
"I've been on the front lines with many of you fighting for the right to life for unborn children," she said.
Martinez also spoke out in favor of a border wall and said she supports the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Valerie Plame meets with voters in Farmington Valerie Plame hopes to be the Democratic Party's nominee for Congressional District 3, and some of the Republican candidates have identified her as the candidate that will be hardest to defeat in the general election.
"You've got to pick the candidate who can beat that Plame woman," said Karen Bedonie, who is running for the Republican nomination, during the San Juan County Patriots meeting.
Out of all the candidates in both parties, Plame has the most name recognition. She served in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for decades before her identity as a covert officer was leaked in 2003. Plame said a member of the President George W. Bush administration leaked her identity in retaliation for an opinion piece her husband published in the New York Times criticizing the war in Iraq.
"I love what I did," she said during a campaign visit. "I felt like it was really meaningful."
She said if her identity had not been leaked, she would still be overseas "chasing bad guys around the world."
More recently, Plame gained national attention for her action movie style campaign video, which featured her driving a sports car and has received more than a million views on YouTube.
Plame said her experience sets her apart from the rest of the candidates. She said she has more Washington, D.C. experience than her fellow candidates.
"You deserve a congresswoman who walks in on day one and knows how crazy Washington works," Plame said.
Plame said if elected she will be focused on the issues important to New Mexicans. She said the three issues she has heard people across the district talking about are employment, education and the environment.
In terms of the environment, she said she does not support a proposal to retrofit the San Juan Generating Station with carbon capture technology because it doesn't sound like a "fully-baked technology" and it still relies on coal. Instead, she said the two national labs in New Mexico should focus on developing green energy technology and the government should provide incentives for those technologies.
"New Mexico has such potential to be a leader in green energy," Plame said.
Republican CD3 candidates speak about guns during forum Three Republican candidates for Congressional District 3 emphasized their support of the Second Amendment while participating in a candidate forum during the San Juan County Patriots meeting.
Audra Brown carried her gun with her and said the 2019 New Mexico legislative session prompted her to run for office.
"This all started for me with Second Amendment advocacy," she said.
Brown said she was one of the people who traveled to Santa Fe during the 2019 legislative session to protest bills like the Extreme Risk Protection Order, also known as red flag laws. This bill ultimately failed but is on the 2020 legislative session agenda.
"I'm not a politician," Brown said. "But I don't think that's what we need right now. I think we need something stronger. We need something like our president. We need someone who will stand up, who will take the insults and smile, but not back down... Compromise is not negotiated reductions in our liberties."
Anastacia "Anise" Golden Morper said the Second Amendment protects rights like freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to think.
"Without our Second Amendment rights, we lose everything," she said.
She told a story about begging her father to let her going hunting with him. She said he required her to learn how to break down a weapon and reload the ammo before she could even go with him on a hunting trip. She said she learned how to do everything her father required and, at six years old, joined him on a hunting trip.
"It was hard to keep up with Daddy, because it was quail," she said. "But we had a great time. "I went hunting with my Dad just about every season after that."
She said as a single mother for 16 years she taught her children how to use firearms to defend themselves.
Bedonie's campaign website and the sign she brought to the meeting feature an image of her holding a firearm.
"That picture is not a political picture," Bedonie said. "It's a picture of an American standing for what she believes in."
She said the rifle represents her family accepting their American civility and the citizenship that Native Americans were granted in 1926 by her favorite president, Calvin Coolidge.
Bedonie also emphasized her support of fossil fuels, including coal.
"We need it," she said. "It's a gift from the holy people."

Texto completo: Rutgers University's governing boards on Tuesday morning officially approved hiring Northwestern University provost Jonathan Holloway to be Rutgers' first non-white president since the university's inception 254 years ago.
Holloway, a former dean at Yale University who was once a football teammate of Sen. Cory Booker's at Stanford, will take the helm at Rutgers on July 1, when current president Robert Barchi retires.
Holloway's base salary will be $780,000.
Holloway, 52, will take the reins from Barchi, the university's 20th president, with the state university in its best position in years. During Barchi's tenure, enrollment at the state institution continued an upward trend, even while national college enrollment declined. Annual fundraising nearly tripled to $250 million, and endowment swelled from $690 million to well over $1 billion.
Rutgers' undergraduate enrollment stood at 35,600 in 2017.
During Tuesday's board meeting, Gov. Phil Murphy praised Holloway's leadership. The two reportedly met last week to discuss the position.
"I look forward to working alongside Jonathan to see Rutgers realize its full potential," Murphy said. "Today is a historic day for Rutgers but is an equally historic day for the state of New Jersey."
Holloway said he looks forward to breaking financial barriers to Rutgers' New Brunswick, Camden and Newark campuses.
He added that he hopes to strengthen the university's ties with New Jersey political leaders in ways that not only promote funding for the institution but also facilitate opportunities for faculty.
"Through my scholarship, I have come to appreciate the nuances that are woven into the fabric of a research university," he said.
"I think of universities as beloved communities," he added.
During the search for Barchi's successor, some in the Rutgers community had discussed that it might be time for a non-white leader at the state's public university.
"Rutgers presidents have consistently been white men, and that doesn't reflect New Jersey," Todd Wolfson, a journalism professor at Rutgers and president of the faculty union, said recently. "I would hope one of the top priorities the committee has is to select candidates who are women and a person of color."
Rutgers was far from unusual among academic institutions by not having a minority or woman at the helm. In 2016, seven out 10 college presidents were men and fewer than one in five were a racial minority, according to a study of American college presidents by the American Council on Education.
The study also showed a move toward more diversity at the college presidential level as the percentage of women and minority presidents had increased, albeit slowly, over the last 30 years.
"We live in an era of first," Holloway said Tuesday, calling it "exciting, flattering, shameful."
Holloway also addressed the university's ties to slavery. Rutgers in 2016 released a groundbreaking report with research that painted a dramatic picture of slaves' roles in constructing the university.
"Rutgers has demonstrated the maturity to recognize its history," he said. "Universities are too often afraid of that kind of honest reckoning. This will not be a university afraid of its past."
Rutgers Board of Governors Chairman Mark Angelson said race was not a factor in selection. Holloway was the final pick from roughly 250 nominations narrowed down during the course of several months.
"It was clear from the beginning, out of all those candidates, that this was our guy," Angelson said. "He has a giant heart and a sense of humor, maybe the most important attributes for a university president."
Northwestern President Morton Schapiro praised Holloway for creating a rigorous budget review process that "aided in Northwestern's financial turnaround."
He also credited Holloway for helping to strengthen the administration's relationship with the faculty senate, emphasizing global issues and having a strong voice on diversity and inclusion.
"Jonathan has been an indispensable member of my senior leadership team," Schapiro said. "Rutgers has found an outstanding new president."
Holloway is a professor of history and African American studies, focusing on post-emancipation U.S. history.
When he was teaching at Yale, Holloway started his course each semester by telling students about how he became a historian, according to a story in the Yale News from 2008.
His mother was a preschool teacher in Concord, Massachusetts, and would take the 5-year-old on her field trips, where he would see the breastworks where the minutemen had stood during the historic Battle of Lexington and Concord. On one of those trips, she made a headstone rubbing of a slave who bought his freedom and died on the eve of the American Revolution.
"Though he was born in a land of slavery, he was born free," the epitaph read. "Though he lived in a land of liberty, he lived a slave." The rubbing hung in the Holloway home for years, and he later hung it in his office at Yale, according to the Yale News story.
Holloway was the first black dean of Yale College, a post he filled from 2014 to 2017.
But in addition to his roles as administrator and professor, Holloway, who teaches about the civil rights era, found himself in the middle of on-campus racial protests in 2015.
The protests were set off by an email from the university's Intercultural Affairs Committee that asked students to avoid culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. A faculty member challenged the request, and tensions flared.
Holloway, who supported the request, worked to repair frayed relationships between students and the university and was known as receptive to student demands.
Yet he was also criticized by some students who said he remained disconnected from their problems and wasn't doing enough to mend race relations on campus.
At one impromptu protest, The New York Times reported, Holloway spent two hours listening to nearly 200 black students voice their concerns.
"When I literally went out to be amongst them," he said Tuesday, "they knew enough to trust that I would listen to them, that I will be honest with them, frankly to the point of saying I will do better."
A year later, Holloway announced he would leave Yale to become provost of Northwestern. He said the decision was not related to the protests.
In late 2018, Holloway defended Northwestern's decision to allow a controversial researcher on campus. Some faculty and students decried the researcher's work as racist and sexist, but officials, citing academic freedom, declined to expel him from campus.
Speaking Tuesday about the incident, Holloway called it an "extremely painful" and "no-win situation."
"A university should be about testing ideas," he said, adding that he "was not prepared to sacrifice Northwestern's academic reputation" but is committed to safety on campus.
Holloway earned a doctorate in history from Yale in 1995. He spent 22 years at the institution.
Holloway grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, but moved to California to attend Stanford University.
While earning his undergraduate degree, he played outside linebacker for Stanford Cardinal football. One of his teammates was U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
"He and I were there at the same time," Holloway told The Daily Northwestern in August. "In fact, we were both recruited by the same guy. He played wide receiver and just couldn't cut it there and sort of was on the same track I was: Big recruit, flame out."
Holloway earned USA Today All-American honorable mention in high school. He also ran indoor and outdoor track. But in college, he said, athletics were frustrating.
"I learned what failure looked like," he said. "I'd not failed publicly like that in my life. I love working with athletes, because they fail every single day. And when they fail, they get up and they try again."
Holloway will take the reins as Rutgers' dismal Big 10 football program starts to rebuild under head coach Greg Schiano, who was just rehired last month. He had led Rutgers to multiple bowl appearances over 11 years before departing in 2011 to coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Holloway on Tuesday acknowledged concerns about the outsized role of athletic programs in the university environment but added that they are critical to the school's "purpose and pride" when directed ethically.
"Nothing can convene more people at once," he said of athletics programs. "It coheres community in a great way."

Holloway earned USA Today All-American honorable mention in high school. He also ran indoor and outdoor track. But in college, he said, athletics were frustrating.
"I learned what failure looked like," he said. "I'd not failed publicly like that in my life. I love working with athletes, because they fail every single day. And when they fail, they get up and they try again."
Holloway will take the reins as Rutgers' dismal Big 10 football program starts to rebuild under head coach Greg Schiano, who was just rehired last month. He had led Rutgers to multiple bowl appearances over 11 years before departing in 2011 to coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Holloway on Tuesday acknowledged concerns about the outsized role of athletic programs in the university environment but added that they are critical to the school's "purpose and pride" when directed ethically.
"Nothing can convene more people at once," he said of athletics programs. "It coheres community in a great way."

Texto completo: Rutgers University's governing boards on Tuesday morning officially approved hiring Northwestern University provost Jonathan Holloway to be Rutgers' first non-white president since the university's inception 254 years ago.
Holloway, a former dean at Yale University who was once a football teammate of Sen. Cory Booker's at Stanford, will take the helm at Rutgers on July 1, when current president Robert Barchi retires.
Holloway's base salary will be $780,000.
Holloway, 52, will take the reins from Barchi, the university's 20th president, with the state university in its best position in years. During Barchi's tenure, enrollment at the state institution continued an upward trend, even while national college enrollment declined. Annual fundraising nearly tripled to $250 million, and endowment swelled from $690 million to well over $1 billion.
Rutgers' undergraduate enrollment stood at 35,600 in 2017.
During Tuesday's board meeting, Gov. Phil Murphy praised Holloway's leadership. The two reportedly met last week to discuss the position.
"I look forward to working alongside Jonathan to see Rutgers realize its full potential," Murphy said. "Today is a historic day for Rutgers but is an equally historic day for the state of New Jersey."
Holloway said he looks forward to breaking financial barriers to Rutgers' New Brunswick, Camden and Newark campuses.
He added that he hopes to strengthen the university's ties with New Jersey political leaders in ways that not only promote funding for the institution but also facilitate opportunities for faculty.
"Through my scholarship, I have come to appreciate the nuances that are woven into the fabric of a research university," he said.
"I think of universities as beloved communities," he added.
During the search for Barchi's successor, some in the Rutgers community had discussed that it might be time for a non-white leader at the state's public university.
"Rutgers presidents have consistently been white men, and that doesn't reflect New Jersey," Todd Wolfson, a journalism professor at Rutgers and president of the faculty union, said recently. "I would hope one of the top priorities the committee has is to select candidates who are women and a person of color."
Rutgers was far from unusual among academic institutions by not having a minority or woman at the helm. In 2016, seven out 10 college presidents were men and fewer than one in five were a racial minority, according to a study of American college presidents by the American Council on Education.
The study also showed a move toward more diversity at the college presidential level as the percentage of women and minority presidents had increased, albeit slowly, over the last 30 years.
"We live in an era of first," Holloway said Tuesday, calling it "exciting, flattering, shameful."
Holloway also addressed the university's ties to slavery. Rutgers in 2016 released a groundbreaking report with research that painted a dramatic picture of slaves' roles in constructing the university.
"Rutgers has demonstrated the maturity to recognize its history," he said. "Universities are too often afraid of that kind of honest reckoning. This will not be a university afraid of its past."
Rutgers Board of Governors Chairman Mark Angelson said race was not a factor in selection. Holloway was the final pick from roughly 250 nominations narrowed down during the course of several months.
"It was clear from the beginning, out of all those candidates, that this was our guy," Angelson said. "He has a giant heart and a sense of humor, maybe the most important attributes for a university president."
Northwestern President Morton Schapiro praised Holloway for creating a rigorous budget review process that "aided in Northwestern's financial turnaround."
He also credited Holloway for helping to strengthen the administration's relationship with the faculty senate, emphasizing global issues and having a strong voice on diversity and inclusion.
"Jonathan has been an indispensable member of my senior leadership team," Schapiro said. "Rutgers has found an outstanding new president."
Holloway is a professor of history and African American studies, focusing on post-emancipation U.S. history.
When he was teaching at Yale, Holloway started his course each semester by telling students about how he became a historian, according to a story in the Yale News from 2008.
His mother was a preschool teacher in Concord, Massachusetts, and would take the 5-year-old on her field trips, where he would see the breastworks where the minutemen had stood during the historic Battle of Lexington and Concord. On one of those trips, she made a headstone rubbing of a slave who bought his freedom and died on the eve of the American Revolution.
"Though he was born in a land of slavery, he was born free," the epitaph read. "Though he lived in a land of liberty, he lived a slave." The rubbing hung in the Holloway home for years, and he later hung it in his office at Yale, according to the Yale News story.
Holloway was the first black dean of Yale College, a post he filled from 2014 to 2017.
But in addition to his roles as administrator and professor, Holloway, who teaches about the civil rights era, found himself in the middle of on-campus racial protests in 2015.
The protests were set off by an email from the university's Intercultural Affairs Committee that asked students to avoid culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. A faculty member challenged the request, and tensions flared.
Holloway, who supported the request, worked to repair frayed relationships between students and the university and was known as receptive to student demands.
Yet he was also criticized by some students who said he remained disconnected from their problems and wasn't doing enough to mend race relations on campus.
At one impromptu protest, The New York Times reported, Holloway spent two hours listening to nearly 200 black students voice their concerns.
"When I literally went out to be amongst them," he said Tuesday, "they knew enough to trust that I would listen to them, that I will be honest with them, frankly to the point of saying I will do better."
A year later, Holloway announced he would leave Yale to become provost of Northwestern. He said the decision was not related to the protests.
In late 2018, Holloway defended Northwestern's decision to allow a controversial researcher on campus. Some faculty and students decried the researcher's work as racist and sexist, but officials, citing academic freedom, declined to expel him from campus.
Speaking Tuesday about the incident, Holloway called it an "extremely painful" and "no-win situation."
"A university should be about testing ideas," he said, adding that he "was not prepared to sacrifice Northwestern's academic reputation" but is committed to safety on campus.
Holloway earned a doctorate in history from Yale in 1995. He spent 22 years at the institution.
Holloway grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, but moved to California to attend Stanford University.
While earning his undergraduate degree, he played outside linebacker for Stanford Cardinal football. One of his teammates was U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
"He and I were there at the same time," Holloway told The Daily Northwestern in August. "In fact, we were both recruited by the same guy. He played wide receiver and just couldn't cut it there and sort of was on the same track I was: Big recruit, flame out."

Covington Catholic grad could be key figure in impeachment

Texto completo: Pat Cipollone isn't a household name. But that could soon change.
The 1984 Covington Catholic High School graduate's work as the lead attorney of President Donald Trump's defense team has placed him at the center of the impeachment drama.
He may now be a witness in the trial.
As the third impeachment trial in United States' history begins, House Democrats issued a letter demanding Cipollone reveal any firsthand knowledge he has related to the two articles of impeachment.
"In light of your extensive knowledge of these key events, your personal representation of President Trump threatens to undermine the integrity of the pending trial," the letter reads.
It is signed by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif, the lead impeachment manager in the House, and six other Democratic members of Congress serving as impeachment managers.
The heart of the issue, according to the Democrats in the letter, is Cipollone's role as a White House attorney and supervisor to John Eisenberg, a deputy counsel to the president for National Security Affairs.
Witnesses testified in the House investigation they brought concerns to Eisenberg shortly after Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. That's the call in which the president asked Zelenskiy to investigate the son of Trump's political rival, Hunter Biden.
The House Democrats in the letter also accuse Cipollone of withholding the whistleblower's complaint from Congress and directing witnesses not to testify.
"Your office was also directly involved in potential efforts to conceal President Trump's scheme from Congress and the public," the letter stated.
Cipollone, 53, spent much of his childhood in the Bronx borough of New York City as the son of a factory worker, according to a New York Times profile. When his father was transferred to Northern Kentucky, Cipollone attended Covington Catholic High School in Park Hills.
He then moved back to New York to attend Fordham University.
He has spent most of his 30-year career in Washington and Chicago.

New Jersey Senate avoids vote on bill to remove religious exemption from immunizations

Texto completo: A bill that would have ended a policy that allows New Jersey parents not to immunize their children because of religious beliefs and still enroll them in school stalled in the state Senate.
The Senate did not have enough votes to advance the measure to the General Assembly and the governor, so there was no vote on Jan. 13 - the last chance to pass bills before the end of the two-year legislative session.
The bill included an exemption for private schools, which could decide for themselves whether or not to accept unvaccinated students. The exemption was approved as an amendment on Jan. 9.
State Sen. Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat and a sponsor of the legislation, said the Senate would reintroduce a new version in the 2020-21 session.
Some 2.3 percent of kindergartners and 1.7 percent of sixth-graders in New Jersey used the religious exemption in the 2018-19 school year, according to the New Jersey Department of Health.
Agudath Israel of America was among the organizations that lobbied against the legislation.
A massive measles outbreak spread though New York City from October 2018 and ended in September 2019. New York is among four states that have limited or revoked religion-based vaccination exemptions, according to The New York Times.
"As immunization rates drop and outbreaks of preventable disease rise, I'm disappointed we were not able to vote on this vital legislation," Weinberg said in a statement.
She added: "Though I understand the passion of those opposed, fundamentally, this is not a personal choice and in society it is the duty of healthy members to work together to protect those who cannot protect themselves."

Director behind 50+ Super Bowl ads

Texto completo: Bryan Buckley's first Super Bowl commercial aired more than two decades ago. It was a 30-second spot for Monster.com, shot in black and white, with children speaking directly into the camera about their comically bleak career goals.
"I want to claw my way up to middle management," one says in the 1999 ad.
"I want to be forced into early retirement!" says another.
Buckley thought it would be a hit. Eventually, it came to be considered one.
But the initial reactions – including in USA TODAY's Ad Meter – were tepid, Buckley recalled. And his client "was freaking out."
"Because it's the Super Bowl," Buckley said, "the stakes are so, so high."
Few directors understand those stakes like Buckley, a 56-year-old Massachusetts native who has directed more than 50 Super Bowl commercials over the past two decades. He's directed multiple Super Bowl ads in 16 of the past 20 years. And he's been behind the scenes of several memorable Super Bowl commercials, from E-Trade's brilliant "well, we just wasted $2 million bucks" after a monkey dances for 30 seconds, to an inspiring Microsoft commercial about a controller for video games last year.
"I just feel very fortunate to be in this position, to do work that's going to be exposed at such a large level," Buckley said in a telephone interview. "You realize that we're creating pieces of pop culture here, that go out there and can influence things in many different ways. I'm very conscious of that."
Buckley is directing two ads this year: a Boston-themed Hyundai commercial featuring Rachel Dratch, Chris Evans, John Krasinski and David Ortiz, and a 30-second spot for SodaStream.
But he's also evolved beyond commercials. His short film "Saria," which tells the stories of two young female orphans in Guatemala, was recently nominated for an Academy Award. His 2012 short film "Asad," in which the entire cast consisted of Somali refugees with no prior acting experience, also received an Oscar nomination.
Buckley believes all of his work "ties together," whether it's a comedic 30-second spot for CareerBuilder with more monkeys or an emotional 23-minute opus. It's all storytelling.
So Buckley is not one to get caught up in labels.
"If you want to call me a commercial guy, it's OK. At some point, maybe they'll call me a feature director," Buckley said. "At one point, they called me an ad guy."
That was "ancient history," he notes – in the late 1980s.
Buckley, who never went to film school, graduated from Syracuse with a degree in advertising design and opened up his own ad agency with fellow 20-something Tom DeCerchio shortly thereafter. They went against the grain but had immediate success, earning accolades from industry magazines and feature stories in The New York Times. But they hated it. So both Buckley and DeCerchio moved to Los Angeles to become screenwriters.
"We sold a screenplay to Columbia Pictures and we thought, 'Oh, this is easy! Hollywood!'" Buckley said.
That thinking proved to be naive. Instead, Buckley ultimately found steady work co-directing commercials for a then-burgeoning sports channel called ESPN. He co-directed an estimated 30 to 40 editions of the now-famous "This Is SportsCenter" campaign and about 180 hockey-related spots. He called it "film school on ice, basically."
"I didn't call myself a director for the first year, year and half, because I was embarrassed," Buckley said. "I didn't really believe it. A guy shows up on set and tells hockey players what to do? (That) didn't seem like a director to me."
Buckley eventually warmed to the title, though, and after the Monster.com ad in 1999, his Super Bowl seasons grew increasingly busy. He directed three commercials apiece in 2002 and 2003 and four in 2005 and 2006. In 2011, he directed six ads for six companies.
Buckley said the beginnings of each commercial, and his influence within it, can vary.
Some companies or ad agencies give the director an airtight script and little room for change, he said.
Others have a general idea and trust the director to make it work.
Decisions on casting, location, script and final edits can all fall within Buckley's purview – in addition to, of course, the actual filming and framing of the ad.
With 30-second advertising slots during the Super Bowl broadcast now selling for between $5 million and $5.6 million, the pressure to get it right is immense. And Buckley said it's becoming increasingly difficult for an ad to resonate.
"If you're not top-five, then you're not talked about. That's it. It's over, in my mind," he said. "And how do you get to top five? How do you get there? It's not easy. And really, there's no set formula."
Though 30-second Super Bowl commercials might not carry the same prestige as Academy Award nominations, Buckley takes them just as seriously and has found them to be just as meaningful. He mentioned last year's Microsoft commercial, which finished third in USA TODAY's Ad Meter rankings, as one example. The ad shows a 9-year-old named Owen, who has a rare physical condition called Escobar syndrome, playing video games.
It's an ad for the Xbox adaptive controller, but almost a mini-documentary. And Buckley said it was one of the most satisfying projects of his career.
"A great kid who has a difficult physical disability suddenly launched onto a national (platform) – it was beautiful," he said. "You can't make up that moment."

Texto completo: Would you still eat that candy bar if the label, in addition to noting the sweet morsel held 230 calories, including the fact that you'd need 42 minutes of walking or 22 minutes of running to burn them off?
The Associated Press asked a similar question in a recent story about the movement to improve food labeling so people might make better choices.
On the other side of that argument, an obesity expert at the University of Ottawa told the AP that "the idea that exercise is a punishment for eating does not strike me as a good way to promote exercise or healthy attitudes around food" as opposed to "promoting environments where it's easier to make good choices."
Seems to me that an important element of making good choices is finding the right weight-loss program for you as an individual. The concept, called personalization, is based on the principle that one size doesn't fit all when it comes to dieting.
After all, if your pants fit you, you wear them. If they don't, you get rid of 'em. Why should weight loss be any different? Without personalization, a diet is a diet. With personalization, it becomes a habit and a lifestyle.
Last November, researchers from Harvard College and King's College in London presented early results of their new study that showed surprising outcomes about how individuals process fats and carbohydrates. As The New York Times put it: "how efficiently a person metabolized one micronutrient was no predictor of how that person might respond to another," even among twins.
The Times concluded that the ongoing study by 40 scientists around the world of 700 identical twins, 300 individual British volunteers and 100 from the U.S. pointed out that "the more important factors in how our bodies metabolize food, it seems are environmental: sleep, stress, exercise and the diversity and population of our individual gut microbiomes."
So what's a person to do? There's certainly no lack of diets out there and now there are even apps you can use.
How do you know what's right for you?
Those smart folks at the Mayo Clinic offer some tips that might help you make that decision:
Before you start a program, talk to your doctor about your medications, medical issues, how to exercise safely and previous diet programs you may have tried.
Know your goals and personal needs. What other diets worked for you or didn't? What did you like or hate about them? Are you looking to take this on by yourself or with others? Does cost fit your budget?
Evaluate the plans. What's involved? Is there research or science to back up the program? Are there risks? What outcomes can you expect?
Pick a plan or program you can live with.
Results don't happen overnight. You're making a lifestyle change, not just a change in what you eat or how often. Whatever choice you make, you need to embrace it for a lifetime, not fight it every day.
You'll know pretty quickly whether the plan or program is right for you. But don't give up if the first one – or the ninth one – doesn't' work.

Texto completo: South Carolinians seem to be a lot more curious about one presidential candidate than people in other states, a study found.
Flourish used Google Trends data to find which Democratic presidential candidate was the most searched in every county in the country during the week of Jan. 6-13.
The candidates included were those who participated in the Jan. 14 debate in Iowa.
Although Bernie Sanders was the most searched-for candidate in most counties in the country, people in South Carolina seemed to have a different interest.
In all but 10 of the state's 46 counties, Tom Steyer was the most Googled candidate, according to the study.
Joe Biden was the most searched-for in four counties in the state and Bernie Sanders was the most searched-for in five counties, the study found. Elizabeth Warren was the most searched-for in Lee County.
Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar didn't come out on top in any of the state's counties.
South Carolina is an important state for presidential hopefuls.
The state's primary election is Feb. 29, which is just days before Super Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold their primary elections, CBS News reported.
Additionally, South Carolina is the first primary held in a state with a significant share of black voters, according to NPR News. It's also the first primary in the South, The State reported.
African American voters make up about two-thirds of South Carolina's "Democratic party voting bloc," The State reported in November.
South Carolina is usually red, with a Republican winning the state in the presidential election every year so far since 1980, according to Ballotpedia.
In 2016, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton won the primaries in South Carolina, according to Ballotpedia. In 2012, Newt Gingrich won the state's Republican primary but didn't go on to become the party's nominee, according to The New York Times.
In 2008, Barack Obama and John McCain won the Democratic and Republican primaries, respectively, and were both their party's presidential nominees, The New York Times reported.
Steyer has spent more than Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg on advertising in South Carolina, coming out to about $10 million as of December, The State reported.
Although the billionaire seems to have piqued the interest of people in South Carolina, his chances of actually winning in the state are less than promising.
Steyer is predicted to win an "average of 7% of the vote" in the state, according to FiveThirtyEight, and he has about a .9% chance of winning the most votes in the state.
Biden is the most likely Democratic winner in the state, according to FiveThirtyEight's forecast, and he has a 63% chance of winning the most votes in the state.

Texto completo: Jimmy Heath, 93, a tenor saxophonist whose sharp and lively compositions became part of the midcentury jazz canon - and who found new prominence in middle age as a co-leader of a popular band with his two brothers - died Sunday in Loganville, Georgia.
His grandson Fa Mtume confirmed his death.
Heath's saxophone sound was spare but playful, with a beaming tone that exuded both joy and command. But his reputation rested equally on his abilities as a composer and arranger for large ensembles, interpolating bebop's crosshatched rhythms and extended improvisations into fulsome tapestries.
He was a teenager touring the Midwestern dance circuit with the Nat Towles Orchestra in the 1940s when he became enamored with arranging. At first he could hardly read music, but he proved a quick study.
When a particular harmony struck him, he hounded his fellow horn players to tell him what notes they were playing, then pieced together the chords on sheet music. Before long he was writing for a 16-piece band of his own, whose lineup included future saxophone luminaries John Coltrane and Benny Golson.
His career in many ways tracked the life cycle of postwar jazz in the United States. After touring with dance bands, he moved on to the fresher, more cosmopolitan bebop style, playing in groups led by trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.
Originally an alto saxophonist, he earned the nickname Little Bird for his ability to emulate the fleet playing of the bebop pioneer Charlie Parker, known as Bird. He soon switched to the tenor, partly to skirt the comparisons, and established himself as a central figure on the New York scene.
In the mid-1970s, when R&B and rock had eclipsed jazz's popularity, he founded the Heath Brothers with his older brother, Percy, a bassist, and his younger brother, Albert, known as Tootie, a drummer. That band welcomed the electric instruments and strutting rhythms of a younger generation into its own distinctive style, which hopscotched between straight-ahead jazz and soulful fusion.
Heath titled his autobiography, written with Joseph McLarin and published in 2010, "I Walked With Giants," a playful reference to his 5-foot-3 stature as well as to the fact that he spent much of his life working alongside the most lauded names in jazz.
Reflecting on his long career, Heath often said that although he never achieved as much renown as some of his contemporaries, he was satisfied. "You become an 'icon' when you're dead," he told NPR Music in 2014. "I always say I'd rather be an 'acorn,' and be alive."
Yet from the 1990s, he did enjoy recognition as a jazz eminence. In 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts named him a Jazz Master.
In 1993, his Verve album "Little Man, Big Band" was nominated for a Grammy. Also that year, he jammed with President Bill Clinton at a White House jazz concert produced by the Thelonious Monk Institute, where he served on the board of advisers.
Clinton borrowed Heath's saxophone to play on a blues number and, with Heath's help, found the right key. As Heath recalled in his book, "He stumbled, but he landed on his feet."

Rutgers approves first non-white president

Texto completo: Rutgers University's governing boards on Tuesday morning officially approved hiring Northwestern University provost Jonathan Holloway to be Rutgers' first non-white president since the university's inception 254 years ago.
Holloway, a former dean at Yale University who was once a football teammate of Sen. Cory Booker's at Stanford, will take the helm at Rutgers on July 1, when current president Robert Barchi retires.
Holloway's base salary will be $780,000.
Holloway, 52, will take the reins from Barchi, the university's 20th president, with the state university in its best position in years. During Barchi's tenure, enrollment at the state institution continued an upward trend, even while national college enrollment declined. Annual fundraising nearly tripled to $250 million, and endowment swelled from $690 million to well over $1 billion.
Rutgers' undergraduate enrollment stood at 35,600 in 2017.
During Tuesday's board meeting, Gov. Phil Murphy praised Holloway's leadership. The two reportedly met last week to discuss the position.
"I look forward to working alongside Jonathan to see Rutgers realize its full potential," Murphy said. "Today is a historic day for Rutgers but is an equally historic day for the state of New Jersey."
Holloway said he looks forward to breaking financial barriers to Rutgers' New Brunswick, Camden and Newark campuses.
He added that he hopes to strengthen the university's ties with New Jersey political leaders in ways that not only promote funding for the institution but also facilitate opportunities for faculty.
"Through my scholarship, I have come to appreciate the nuances that are woven into the fabric of a research university," he said.
"I think of universities as beloved communities," he added.
During the search for Barchi's successor, some in the Rutgers community had discussed that it might be time for a non-white leader at the state's public university.
"Rutgers presidents have consistently been white men, and that doesn't reflect New Jersey," Todd Wolfson, a journalism professor at Rutgers and president of the faculty union, said recently. "I would hope one of the top priorities the committee has is to select candidates who are women and a person of color."
Rutgers was far from unusual among academic institutions by not having a minority or woman at the helm. In 2016, seven out 10 college presidents were men and fewer than one in five were a racial minority, according to a study of American college presidents by the American Council on Education.
The study also showed a move toward more diversity at the college presidential level as the percentage of women and minority presidents had increased, albeit slowly, over the last 30 years.
"We live in an era of first," Holloway said Tuesday, calling it "exciting, flattering, shameful."
Holloway also addressed the university's ties to slavery. Rutgers in 2016 released a groundbreaking report with research that painted a dramatic picture of slaves' roles in constructing the university.
"Rutgers has demonstrated the maturity to recognize its history," he said. "Universities are too often afraid of that kind of honest reckoning. This will not be a university afraid of its past."
Rutgers Board of Governors Chairman Mark Angelson said race was not a factor in selection. Holloway was the final pick from roughly 250 nominations narrowed down during the course of several months.
"It was clear from the beginning, out of all those candidates, that this was our guy," Angelson said. "He has a giant heart and a sense of humor, maybe the most important attributes for a university president."
Northwestern President Morton Schapiro praised Holloway for creating a rigorous budget review process that "aided in Northwestern's financial turnaround."
He also credited Holloway for helping to strengthen the administration's relationship with the faculty senate, emphasizing global issues and having a strong voice on diversity and inclusion.
"Jonathan has been an indispensable member of my senior leadership team," Schapiro said. "Rutgers has found an outstanding new president."
Holloway is a professor of history and African American studies, focusing on post-emancipation U.S. history.
When he was teaching at Yale, Holloway started his course each semester by telling students about how he became a historian, according to a story in the Yale News from 2008.
His mother was a preschool teacher in Concord, Massachusetts, and would take the 5-year-old on her field trips, where he would see the breastworks where the minutemen had stood during the historic Battle of Lexington and Concord. On one of those trips, she made a headstone rubbing of a slave who bought his freedom and died on the eve of the American Revolution.
"Though he was born in a land of slavery, he was born free," the epitaph read. "Though he lived in a land of liberty, he lived a slave." The rubbing hung in the Holloway home for years, and he later hung it in his office at Yale, according to the Yale News story.
Holloway was the first black dean of Yale College, a post he filled from 2014 to 2017.
But in addition to his roles as administrator and professor, Holloway, who teaches about the civil rights era, found himself in the middle of on-campus racial protests in 2015.
The protests were set off by an email from the university's Intercultural Affairs Committee that asked students to avoid culturally insensitive Halloween costumes.
A faculty member challenged the request, and tensions flared.
Holloway, who supported the request, worked to repair frayed relationships between students and the university and was known as receptive to student demands.
Yet he was also criticized by some students who said he remained disconnected from their problems and wasn't doing enough to mend race relations on campus.
At one impromptu protest, The New York Times reported, Holloway spent two hours listening to nearly 200 black students voice their concerns.
"When I literally went out to be amongst them," he said Tuesday, "they knew enough to trust that I would listen to them, that I will be honest with them, frankly to the point of saying I will do better."
A year later, Holloway announced he would leave Yale to become provost of Northwestern. He said the decision was not related to the protests.
In late 2018, Holloway defended Northwestern's decision to allow a controversial researcher on campus. Some faculty and students decried the researcher's work as racist and sexist, but officials, citing academic freedom, declined to expel him from campus.
Speaking Tuesday about the incident, Holloway called it an "extremely painful" and "no-win situation."
"A university should be about testing ideas," he said, adding that he "was not prepared to sacrifice Northwestern's academic reputation" but is committed to safety on campus.
Holloway earned a doctorate in history from Yale in 1995. He spent 22 years at the institution.
Holloway grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, but moved to California to attend Stanford University.
While earning his undergraduate degree, he played outside linebacker for Stanford Cardinal football. One of his teammates was U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
"He and I were there at the same time," Holloway told The Daily Northwestern in August. "In fact, we were both recruited by the same guy. He played wide receiver and just couldn't cut it there and sort of was on the same track I was: Big recruit, flame out."
Holloway earned USA Today All-American honorable mention in high school. He also ran indoor and outdoor track. But in college, he said, athletics were frustrating.
"I learned what failure looked like," he said. "I'd not failed publicly like that in my life. I love working with athletes, because they fail every single day. And when they fail, they get up and they try again."
Holloway will take the reins as Rutgers' dismal Big 10 football program starts to rebuild under head coach Greg Schiano, who was just rehired last month. He had led Rutgers to multiple bowl appearances over 11 years before departing in 2011 to coach the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Holloway on Tuesday acknowledged concerns about the outsized role of athletic programs in the university environment but added that they are critical to the school's "purpose and pride" when directed ethically.

Texto completo: A comedian who hosted a hit late-night talk show, writes books and acts in films will return to Wind Creek Event Center, it was announced Tuesday.
Chelsea Handler, who from 2007 to 2014 was star of the E! Network talk show "Chelsea Lately," will perform at 8 p.m. March 13.
Tickets - at $49.50-$79.50 - go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday at the event center box office at 77 Wind Creek Boulevard, Bethlehem, at www.windcreekeventcenter, and 610-297-7414.
Handler from 2016-17 had the Netflix talk show "Chelsea," on which she traveled the world - going to an ice-skating rink in Russia and wielding a Trump-shaped piñata through the streets of Mexico and back again to Los Angeles - where she taped in front of a live studio audience featuring celebrities.
The show's 120 episodes continue to be available for streaming.
Last year she also released a Netflix documentary, "Hello, Privilege. It's Me, Chelsea."
Handler, a New Jersey native, debuted in 2007 on "Chelsea Lately," in which she offered caustic commentary and sarcastic and critical views on celebrities. The show was so popular that it prompted a spinoff, "After Lately," which ran 2011-13, and another show, "Comedians of Chelsea Lately," which ran briefly in 2009.
Handler got her start in stand-up comedy as a regular on the Oxygen Network series "Girls Behaving Badly" in 2002. Handler also has been a correspondent on "The Tonight Show" and was the host of the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards.
She also had an NBC-TV sitcom, "Are You There, Chelsea?" in 2012, and has had roles in several movies.
She also has written six books, four of which topped the New York Times Best Seller List. Her most recent book was last year's "Life Will Be the Death of Me: ... And You Too!" It is her first memoir and debuted at No. 1.
Handler performed at the event center, then known as Sands Bethlehem Event Center, in 2014, and added a second show after the first quickly sold out. She also performed at Easton's State Theatre in 2007.

Texto completo: Joe Biden did not win the New York Times' endorsement. But he did win the heart of a security officer named Jacquelyn.
This Sunday, on the Times' show "The Weekly," Democratic presidential candidates were interviewed by newspaper's editorial board, often being grilled on previous stances and policy proposals.
It wasn't revealed who won the endorsement until the end of the episode, which made many on Twitter joke it resembled an episode of "The Bachelor."
Ultimately, the editorial board chose to endorse two candidates: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. This broke convention, as the paper had previously only endorsed one candidate.
But the day after this announcement, many on the internet were talking more about a behind-the scenes moment between Biden and a New York Times building employee.
In the clip, as he is heading to meet with the editorial board, Biden introduces himself to the security guard in the elevator. The woman instantly seems starstruck.
"I love you," she says, "I do. You're like my favorite ... ugh I love you so much."
"Thank you; what's your name?" Biden asks.
"Jacquelyn."
"You got a camera? When we get out, we'll take one."
"Oh my god," Jacquelyn responds.
The end of the clip shows Biden taking a selfie with Jacquelyn, with her giving a thumbs up.
Peter Hamby, a journalist who hosts a show on Snapchat, noted in a tweet Monday afternoon that, at the time, the clip had six times more views on Twitter than the Times' opinion video clips of both Warren and Klobuchar.
Hours later, Biden tweeted: "Honored to have won Jacquelyn's endorsement."

Texto completo: Jimmy Heath, 93, a tenor saxophonist whose sharp and lively compositions became part of the midcentury jazz canon - and who found new prominence in middle age as a co-leader of a popular band with his two brothers - died Sunday in Loganville, Georgia.
His grandson Fa Mtume confirmed his death.
Heath's saxophone sound was spare but playful, with a beaming tone that exuded both joy and command. But his reputation rested equally on his abilities as a composer and arranger for large ensembles, interpolating bebop's crosshatched rhythms and extended improvisations into fulsome tapestries.
He was a teenager touring the Midwestern dance circuit with the Nat Towles Orchestra in the 1940s when he became enamored with arranging. At first he could hardly read music, but he proved a quick study.
When a particular harmony struck him, he hounded his fellow horn players to tell him what notes they were playing, then pieced together the chords on sheet music. Before long he was writing for a 16-piece band of his own, whose lineup included future saxophone luminaries John Coltrane and Benny Golson. His career in many ways tracked the life cycle of postwar jazz in the United States. After touring with dance bands, he moved on to the fresher, more cosmopolitan bebop style, playing in groups led by trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.
Originally an alto saxophonist, he earned the nickname Little Bird for his ability to emulate the fleet playing of the bebop pioneer Charlie Parker, known as Bird. He soon switched to the tenor, partly to skirt the comparisons, and established himself as a central figure on the New York scene.
In the mid-1970s, when R&B and rock had eclipsed jazz's popularity, he founded the Heath Brothers with his older brother, Percy, a bassist, and his younger brother, Albert, known as Tootie, a drummer. That band welcomed the electric instruments and strutting rhythms of a younger generation into its own distinctive style, which hopscotched between straight-ahead jazz and soulful fusion.
Heath titled his autobiography, written with Joseph McLarin and published in 2010, "I Walked With Giants," a playful reference to his 5-foot-3 stature as well as to the fact that he spent much of his life working alongside the most lauded names in jazz.
Reflecting on his long career, Heath often said that although he never achieved as much renown as some of his contemporaries, he was satisfied. "You become an 'icon' when you're dead," he told NPR Music in 2014. "I always say I'd rather be an 'acorn,' and be alive."
Yet from the 1990s, he did enjoy recognition as a jazz eminence. In 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts named him a Jazz Master.

Hanover
The Dartmouth College community has been shocked and devastated by the suicide of professor David Bucci, which was described in a Jan. 4 New York Times article by national correspondent Anemona Hartocollis.
Bucci was chair of Dartmouth’s Psychological and Brain Sciences Department when nine courageous women, mostly graduate students, broke the silence about the regime of sexual harassment that had persisted in the department for many years and was allowed to go unchecked. They filed a Title IX complaint and then a lawsuit against three professors in the department, alleging sexual misconduct, including sexual harassment and rape.
After Dartmouth investigated, one of the professors retired, two resigned. The lawsuit, too, was finally settled, but many questions and much grief remain.
Missing from the Times article was any discussion of the ongoing pain of the young women who were targeted by the predatory behavior of their male professors, as the lawsuit alleged, or of the misogynist culture in the Psychological and Brain Sciences Department and across the college that sparked the suit.
The Times article cites friends and family members who see Bucci as “a casualty of a scorched-earth legal strategy to pin blame on the Ivy League college.” But sadly, his heartbreaking death is not the only tragedy that followed in the wake of these events. Several of the plaintiffs became suicidal. Their careers were thrown off track. They were disparaged, threatened and discouraged from speaking out. They were “slut-shamed” by Dartmouth College’s response to the lawsuit, which can be seen as a scorched-earth legal strategy to pin the blame on 17- to 23-year-old female students groomed for abuse by professors who were supposed to mentor them.
Hartocollis’ article, however faintly, leaves the impression that the plaintiffs were #MeToo radicals gone too far. Since the publication of this piece, people have been sending the plaintiffs hate mail, blaming them for Bucci’s death.
While any suicide is a terrible loss, it is dangerous to suggest that David Bucci’s death was a result of the lawsuit against Dartmouth.
We do not know why he chose to take his life. This is a complicated situation with many questions still unanswered. We remain unsatisfied with how the college handled these complaints, which forced the victims to sue and deprived Bucci of a chance to clear his name.
Blame and cruelty are not a just response.
We must support professor Bucci’s family and also the young women whose lives were so cruelly transformed — not only by the predatory behavior of older men, as alleged in the suit, but also by the culture of impunity in which they operated.

Texto completo: HARPSWELL -- Oprah Winfrey is making Maine lobster rolls Insta-Famous.
Last month, the media mogul brought her streaming show "Oprah's Book Club" to Harpswell's Dolphin Marina and Restaurant to talk about the novel "Olive, Again," her November book club pick, with Portland-born author Elizabeth Strout in front of a studio audience.
The episode, the second in the series, started streaming on Apple TV+ over the weekend.
Gov. Janet Mills was invited to watch the filming and later met the television host.
The governor on Monday posted a photo of the two together on Facebook.
In a post Monday on Instagram, Winfrey revealed she tried her first lobster roll while visiting, and it wasn't what she was expecting.
"This is the real deal," said Winfrey. "I expected there to be like lots of mayonnaise and stuff in there, but this is pure."
"I think that Popeyes chicken sandwich has some competition," added Winfrey.
In a social media post, Winfrey said she knew she needed to visit Maine after reading "Olive, Again" a portion of which takes place in Maine. Published in 2019, "Olive, Again" is the sequel to "Olive Kitteridge" and immediately became a New York Times Bestseller. The novel follows the life of a slightly-older Olive as she struggles to understand her hardships.
Published in 2008, "Olive Kitteridge" earned Strout a Pulitzer Prize and became an HBO miniseries starring Bill Murray, Richard Jenkins and Frances McDormand.
Speaking on "CBS This Morning" in November, Winfrey described Strout's writing: "One of her secret gifts is that she takes what is ordinary and makes it extraordinary. ... Her gift is taking the simplest of things and turning them into something that feels real to us."
Strout now splits her time between New York and Brunswick.
"Oprah has done so much to support readers and writers over the years," Strout wrote on her website in November, after the book club selected "Olive, Again." "I am really thrilled and honored that she chose OLIVE, AGAIN as her next Oprah's Book Club pick."

NEW TREND: NFL PLAYERS RETIRE EARLY

Texto completo: The breaking news out of Arizona last week was greeted with applause by not just Cardinals fans but also by football fans everywhere who appreciate a tremendous talent. Larry Fitzgerald, who will turn 37 on Aug. 31, announced he is coming back for a 17th NFL season. "This season was among the most fun of my career," he tweeted. "The future is so bright for this team&I relish the opportunity to build with this talented young nucleus."
The breaking news out of Carolina last week was greeted with sadness by not just Panthers fans but also by football fans everywhere who appreciate a tremendous talent. Luke Kuechly announced he is retiring at 28 after just eight NFL seasons. "I still want to play, but I don't think it's the right decision," he said in a video. "I thought about it for a long time. In my heart, I know [retiring] is the right thing to do."
What a contrast.
Fitzgerald already is a rarity, playing so long in a brutally physical sport where the average player lasts just 3.3 seasons. He doesn't need the money; spotrac.com estimated he has made $175 million during his fabulous career. Clearly, Fitzgerald still loves the game and the sacrifices it requires to play it. He ranks second behind legendary Jerry Rice on the NFL's all-time receptions and receiving yardage lists.
Kuechly isn't the rarity that he once was. Other great players have retired recently in their prime, leaving millions of dollars on the table. In the past year, Rob Gronkowski at 29 and Andrew Luck at 29 have walked away from the sport. Calvin Johnson and Patrick Willis were among those who did it before them.
Good for the players, who make their money and then have a chance to live a normal, healthy life.
Bad for the game, which isn't nearly as much fun to watch without so many of its stars.
Luck might be an exception. Quarterbacks still want to play as long as they can, probably because their salaries are so astronomical. Think Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Philip Rivers, Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger. But Gronkowski and Kuechly? They are near the front end of a trend that is going to continue to pick up steam.
"Players are definitely getting smarter," Hall of Famer Carl Eller told the New York Times.
Eller runs the Retired Players Association, which tries to help players transition into life after football.
"They are gathering information to make some tough decisions," Eller said. "For myself, it was all fuzzy ahead of me. It was one step at a time. It was all hearsay. You were going blind into the dark. But today, there's more light at the end of the tunnel."
Much more is known about concussions and their impact. Today's players hear about the variety of health issues that have older players struggling to function normally. They have watched too many of those older players commit suicide.
Gronkowski, the best tight end in history, told CBS News he "probably had 20 concussions in my life, no lie. I remember five blackout ones." Kuechly missed seven games because of at least three known concussions, including one against the New Orleans Saints in 2016 that left him crying on the field. It was an absolutely horrific image.
But it's not just concussions. It's the overall toll that football takes on a player's body. Gronkowski, who retired from the New England Patriots last March, said he had nine surgeries for back, arm and knee injuries and told CBS News he had internal bleeding after the 2019 Super Bowl that required a pint of blood to be drained from his body. Kuechly, the NFL's defensive player of the year in 2013 and a five-time, first-team All-Pro, had surgery to repair a shoulder injury, another to fix a torn labrum. Luck, who retired just days before his Indianapolis Colts opened the regular season, had a lacerated kidney and a major shoulder injury that forced him to sit out the 2017 season.
Player safety measures have made the game better for the players, but, make no mistake, it is still an incredibly violent sport. People who say it has turned into flag football are fools. They couldn't be more wrong.
"For the last four years or so, I've been in this cycle of injury, pain, rehab, injury, pain, rehab, and it's been unceasing, unrelenting, both in-season and offseason," Luck said. "I haven't been able to live the life I want to live. The only way I see out is to no longer play football."
Luck came back from his shoulder surgery to throw for 4,593 yards and 39 touchdowns in 2018 and led the Colts to the playoffs, making his retirement that much more stunning. Colts owner Jim Irsay estimated Luck walked away from potential earnings of $450 million.
I'm thinking Luck really wanted his life back.
But salaries have reached such an incredible level in pro sports that it is easier - although never easy - for star players to say enough is enough when it comes to money and put a greater value on their long-term health. Luck made $97 million in his seven NFL seasons, according to spotrac.com. Gronkowski earned more than $53 million in his nine seasons. Kuechly made nearly $64 million in his eight seasons.
Many other top players will follow in their path and leave football prematurely.
Enjoy watching the great Fitzgerald next season. We're not going to see many more like him in more ways than one.

THE LARGER IMPACT OF TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT THE HEARINGS COULD DISTRACT FROM LARGER POLICY QUESTIONS FACING THE U.S.

Texto completo: This week's news will be dominated by the U.S. Senate's hearings on the impeachment of President Donald Trump
There will be at least two substantive issues at play, serving as the basis for the House of Representatives' charges.
The first charge - abuse of power - is, in my opinion, understated. It is alleged that Mr. Trump offered Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy nearly $400 million in military aid in return for a Ukranian investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
It seems to me that the House should have actually charged Mr. Trump with treason. The idea of using millions in American taxpayer money to pay a foreign country to investigate an American political opponent is, in my view, shocking and, yes, treasonous. It is particularly iniquitous in light of the unresolved charges of foreign intervention in the 2016 presidential election.
The second House charge - obstruction of justice, brought about by Mr. Trump's refusal to allow administration officials to testify - seems more intramural and less serious, in spite of the constitutional problems it presents. Americans have become more accustomed to hissing and fussing between the executive and legislative branches of government under their current leadership than in the past. The idea that the two branches are no longer especially interested in working together to resolve Americans' problems, preferring to duck issues by scrapping with each other, is something that we have become increasingly accustomed to. For instance, does anyone really think that the Republican-dominated Senate will eject Mr. Trump from office, no matter what it turns out he has done?
The third interesting fault line that is likely to turn up in the Senate Trump impeachment hearings is a jurisdictional one, based on the Constitution, between Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Justice Roberts is supposed to preside in the Senate over the hearings. Mr. McConnell has a tendency to see his role in the Senate as akin to that of a Southern chain-gang warden. As an example, he doesn't bring to a Senate vote House-voted legislation that he doesn't agree with.
Mr. Roberts swore the senators to take a judicial approach to the evidence they will review. Mr. McConnell probably plans to drown any Republican senator who votes for impeaching a Republican president in the Potomac River.
The Senate can overrule Justice Roberts' decision with a majority vote. If Mr. McConnell tries that, Mr. Roberts, a strict constitutionalist seeking to separate justices from their party affiliations, will likely throw a fit.
The other interesting question is the degree to which Mr. Trump's paint is scratched by the Senate impeachment hearings. Even if he is not ejected from office, wouldn't it be nice if the president's tax returns were revealed in the hearings?
But even as the entertaining proceedings commence, Americans should keep their eye on how the hearings impact larger questions of policy, particularly foreign policy.
For instance, China, Russia and Turkey recently held joint naval exercises in the Mediterranean Sea. Around the same time, Russia and Turkey helped negotiate a peace agreement among warring elements in Libya. The United States now has little or no role to play in the fractious situation in Libya, in spite of its once powerful role there in petroleum and military matters and its role in the overthrow of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
At face value, the goings on within Libya wouldn't seem to matter much to the U.S. But they do matter a great deal to America's European allies. Libya has been used by African migrants as a springboard by which to enter Europe, posing a unique political and humanitarian problem. With the U.S. sidelined by its pesky domestic affairs, countries like Russia and Turkey could leverage the situation to their advantage.
The U.S. is going to have difficulty formulating and executing a coherent foreign policy as it faces impeachment hearings and a contentious presidential election in 2020. It must not forgo its role as a global leader, but foreign policy decisions must be made responsibly, not randomly. Rough waters likely lay ahead.

Texto completo: The daughter of a school teacher, she came of age before Doppler radar, 10-day weather forecasts, and sophisticated orbiting satellites capable of detecting hurricanes as they form off of Africa and take deadly aim at our Atlantic coast.
As a little girl growing up in Canton she had a favorite TV weatherman: Don Kent, the longtime WBZ-TV forecaster who informed generations of New Englanders about gathering autumn storms, warm summer sunshine, and the icy winds of winter.
And recently, as meteorologists from around the country assembled in Boston for their annual convention, Gina McCarthy took center stage, carrying an even darker forecast than those of epic storms like the Blizzard of '78, which she keenly remembers.
It's nothing less than an urgent bulletin.
Our planet is warming. It's not an opinion. It's real.
And the consequences are more dire than canceled school classes or thousands of cars stranded on highways from Marshfield to Marblehead.
“The big deal is that global warming is changing the entire system of the way energy is distributed in the planet," McCarthy told me the other day at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where she is a professor.
“Our climate is temperate. It's not going to be anymore. The climate isn't tomorrow. Or five years from now. The climate is forever. It's a system of change over 30 to 40 years. So you are literally going to see places that flourish as farmlands today that will be deserts tomorrow. This is an entire shift in how the globe's going to look if we don't do something about it."
Gina McCarthy intends to do something about it.
And those who know her track record — her long and well-earned reputation for no-nonsense, plain-spoken advocacy, her tenacity in the face of nay-sayers or climate-change deniers — say she is a formidable weather system all her own.
Inexorable. Relentless. Blunt.
“Gina is a rock star," said Jenni L. Evans, president of the American Meteorological Society. “We see climate change. It's there. She will talk about how to think about it. How do we give people a sense of self-determination and not a sense that they should slit their wrists?"
There is nothing academic or hypothetical about this. Evans grew up in Australia, parts of which have been blackened by historic wildfires.
Last year, record temperatures were broken in France and Germany. Greenland's ice sheet saw historic melting. Average global temperatures were the second highest on record, less than one-tenth of a degree cooler than 2016.
So Evans knows what hangs in the balance.
And so does McCarthy, who has made this work the centerpiece of her professional life.
As a young woman, she was the health agent for Canton's Board of Health. Governor Michael Dukakis named her to a hazardous waste facility site safety council. After that, she served four Republican governors in Massachusetts and one in Connecticut, Jodi Rell.
In March 2013, President Obama nominated McCarthy as the nation's 13th administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, which she led until 2017, becoming the chief architect of Obama's plan to combat climate change.
And now, the Natural Resources Defense Council has named McCarthy as its president and chief executive, calling her one of the most effective environmental champions of the modern era.
The challenges, particularly in the age of Donald Trump, are daunting.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, Trump has rolled back more than 90 environmental rules and regulations, raising the prospects for a significant increase in greenhouse gases. That means dirtier air. It means weaker auto pollution standards. It means looser rules governing toxic industrial emissions.
“We haven't reached the point of no return, but we don't have as much time as we thought we had," said Mitch Bernard, NRDC's chief counsel. “The next 10 years will be critical in terms of trying to avert the most severe catastrophes from the changing climate.
“Gina is going to try to mobilize the energy and enthusiasm that is out there, especially among young people, for appropriate and vigorous action on climate. Climate change is not out there on the horizon. It's creating misery and huge health problems."
Still, amid all those storm clouds, McCarthy finds a way to be optimistic. For one thing, she's shut off the endless cable TV chatter, a limitless electronic feedback loop of bad news, an echo chamber that serves only to reinforce embedded political views on the right and the left.
And then she looks for silver linings.
“The environment has had tremendous improvement," said McCarthy, who, at age 65, is old enough to remember wiping oily residue off her legs after taking a dip in a polluted Boston Harbor. “But it didn't improve by people saying, 'We can't do it.' It improved by saying, 'OK, we've got to do it.' That's my attitude. I'm not going to give up. I'm not going to claim defeat.
“I'm not going to focus on President Trump and his nonsense, which I know I can't fix right now. We can fight it. And one of the reasons to go to NRDC is because that's what they do. They fight it every day so we can get into the courts. And in most cases, we're winning."
During the Trump presidency, the NRDC has sued the federal government 96 times, fighting his administration on issues ranging from efficiency standards for lightbulbs to endangered species. Its track record? The NRDC says it has emerged victorious in 54 of the 59 cases so far resolved.
“Those are pretty good odds," McCarthy told me. “I'm optimistic because they don't govern well. So even on the stuff they're rolling back in the courts they think they've stacked, we can win."
What does McCarthy want? More electric cars and buses. Energy efficient lightbulbs and toilets. More trees and playgrounds. Public transportation systems that work. Farms that don't contaminate drinking water supplies.
“I need people to be motivated to act," she said. “Not to be hiding out in their closets."
There are no closets in her future. No sandy beaches either.
Retirement, she told me, will have to wait.
“I can't let it go," she said. “How do I do that? I don't just have three kids, I have two grandchildren. And I listen to the young people now. And they're all debating, and many of them deciding not to have children. That breaks my heart. They don't see a future."
From across the table, she shook her head slowly and sadly. And then, with resolve, added this:
“So somehow the energy they're generating needs to be channeled into something more meaningful than giving up. I just think we have to figure out where the positive energy is. It's out there. We've got to nurture that and at some point you're going to see people who, like this president, prey on people's most negative thoughts and amplify those as if that's a path to the future.
“And I'm not going to buy that. And I'm never going to buy that. And I'm never going to stop fighting it."
And then, with all those forecasters calling for unusually warm January weather, Gina McCarthy left for her next appointment.
And her next fight.

BACK TO HIS ROOTS KEN GARGARO LETS THE SUN SHINE IN FOR HIS DIRECTORIAL RETURN WITH THE MUSICAL 'HAIR'

Texto completo: Ken Gargaro admits it's a little weird directing a show in a theater that bears his name.
"I still have trouble saying it out loud," said the founder of Pittsburgh Musical Theater, which started as Gargaro Productions 29 years ago.
He has returned after a two-year absence from directing of any kind to take on "Hair," the "American Tribal Love Rock Musical" that debuted off-Broadway in 1967, went to Broadway the following year and stayed there until 1972 - six months before the end of the Vietnam War draft that is a central theme in the musical.
It was a show of its time: The Civil Rights Act was just 3 years old, and the Black Power Movement was even younger, and songs such as "White Boys" and "Black Boys" could still shock.
Women went braless to demand equal rights, men burned their draft cards as an anti-war protest, and LBGTQ+ people were closeted or shunned.
People young and old experimented with Eastern religions, "psychedelic" and "groovy" were jargon staples, and hippies grew their hair "shoulder length or longer" to signal their anti-establishment leanings.
The generation gap? It was wider than the 240,000 miles traversed to land a man on the moon.
And into this mix, on a wave of pop hits, rode "Hair."
"Good Morning Starshine," "Aquarius," "Easy to Be Hard," "Hare Krishna" and the title song were just a few that made it onto radio. The cast album topped the Billboard 200 charts for 13 weeks in 1969.
Speaking of generation gaps
Mr. Gargaro, 71, has been fully retired since leaving as head of the Robert Morris University theater department two years ago. When he was asked to return to PMT, the time was right.
"I was starting to feel like it might be fun again," he says, in his natural habitat, a rehearsal room. It is empty for now, but there was music in it moments ago - Mr. Gargaro was playing the trumpet, his instrument of choice when he studied music at the University of Pittsburgh, Class of '79.
"After 50 years of doing this, I do love a lot about it," he says. "But I needed a break."
"Hair," which he has directed twice before, seemed as good a place to return to as any. But when he told his wife, Jane, her response was: "Why 'Hair'"
So Mr. Gargaro made it his mission to answer her question.
He decided to explore if the show was truly as dated as it might seem. "I started doing my research, and I began to realize, oh, let's see, the roots of Earth Day are there. The roots of the #MeToo movement. The roots of Black Lives Matter. ."
He began saving current articles from The Washington Post, The New York Times and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that he believed to be "resonant to the fundamental notes that were struck from 1968 to '71."
It wasn't long before he had amassed more than 50 articles and decided to stop. "Every day, there was something that was reflective of the era," he said.
Then the world shifted. The president of the United States had a top Iranian general killed, and the word "war" was not far from everyone's minds.
Mr. Gargaro had initial reservations about how 2020 audiences would view the dilemma of a particular character, Claude, who is deciding whether to resist being drafted into the Vietnam War or accept his fate as his conservative parents believe he must.
"Is he going to go, or is he going to burn his draft card, as his friends have done? I thought that was a weak link, because there is no draft now," Mr. Gargaro says. "But now, well, things have changed."
WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN DRAFTED?
The cast has an average age of 21 - Anthony Marino is the youngest at 19. They did a sobering exercise where they looked at birthdays being called at certain times in the draft and realized who would be called if there was a draft now.
The director told the actors stories of how he and three friends who were of age would listen for draft news on the radio.
"You listened to the radio?" one of the actors asked.
They all laughed, but another cast member recommended a podcast about waiting for draft numbers to be called.
"So now they could really relate to the story," Mr. Gargaro says.
He has added a framing device to the story. To the inevitable question about nudity before intermission, he says he and the cast have decided against it, but at the time, he had not resolved how the scene would play out.
One of the less obvious themes that strikes a chord with the director is "the spiritual journey for transcendence" of young people finding their way in the world.
"Many people thought the show was blasphemous," he explains, "but it was a rejection of institutionalized religion and a search for transcendence in a different way. And even the impression that it may be unpatriotic is actually their brand of patriotism."
And then there are the songs that have been woven into the fabric of pop music.
"To this day, the music kicks butt," Mr. Gargaro says. "They captured a feeling - that joyous nature of being young and thinking you are invincible."
He sometimes feels 30 years younger when he's in rehearsals, partly because of the cast and partly because of the creative team he has assembled.
He is working with Steve Wilson, who most recently directed "Much Ado About Nothing" at Point Park University. Back in eighth grade, Mr. Wilson was a student of Mr. Gargaro's. Now he is a sort of youth liaison.
THAT THEATER NAME
As for his return to Pittsburgh Musical Theater and that plaque bears his name, "It's very weird," he admits.
More importantly, the company he founded has established itself in the West End while meeting the challenges of maintaining a foothold in a very robust theater city.
His successor, Colleen Doyno, "has done a great job of bringing our mission to the attention of politicians - much better than I ever did. I'm really impressed with that," he says.
He thinks he has an answer now to "Why 'Hair'" - and why here - and why now.
"I took the project because I wanted to have some sort of impact," he says finally. "And I thought this is a show that could catch on if the timing is right, and I think it is."

Iranian student just latest sent away at Logan

Texto completo: An Iranian student who planned to attend Northeastern University but was flown out of the United States Monday night on the order of immigration officials is the latest in a growing number of students from Iran who have recently been denied entry at Logan Airport, according to lawyers and Boston-area colleges.
Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old undergraduate student, had been detained by Customs and Border Protection at Logan after arriving Sunday. Dehghani Hossein Abadi's lawyers filed an emergency petition to block his removal Monday night, and Judge Allison D. Burroughs ordered a 48-hour stay.
But before ahearing took place, Dehghani Hossein Abadi was flown to France — in defiance of the judge's order.
Kerry Doyle, one of Dehghani Hossein Abadi's lawyers, called his removal “an outrage."
At the scheduled hearing Tuesday morning, Judge Richard Stearns said the case was now moot, since the student was already out of the country.
“There seems to be some history of CBP ignoring district court orders, which should concern the court," Doyle said during the hearing. She asked that Dehghani Hossein Abadi be returned to the United States, but the judge said there was little he could do to compel immigration officials now that the student was gone.
“I don't think they're going to listen to me," Stearns said.
Dehghani Hossein Abadi is one of at least three Iranian students barred from attending Boston-area schools since September. One of the students hoped to attend Harvard, and another was in the middle of earning an advanced degree at Northeastern. Nationwide, at least 11 Iranian students have been turned away since August at airports across the country despite having valid visas, according to The New York Times.
It was not immediately clear why the Dehghani Hossein Abadi was sent away after the emergency order was issued. According to his attorneys, Burroughs issued her order at 9:27 p.m. Monday, and the Air France flight carrying Dehghani Hossein Abadi to Paris took off soon after 10 p.m. He was not able to speak with his lawyers before he left the country.
Department of Homeland Security officials said that Dehghani Hossein Abadi was the last passenger to board the flight and that the government didn't have the court order at that time.
Customs and Border Protection have wide latitude at ports of entry, such as airports, and there are many reasons a non-US citizen can be denied entry, according to immigration experts. In Dehghani Hossein Abadi's case, customs officials indicated to his lawyers that he had been blocked because he intended to overstay his student visa.
Customs and Border Protection officials said on Tuesday that he was a candidate for expedited removal and ordered him on the Air France flight out of Logan.
But Doyle denied that he planned to remain in the United States longterm, noting that he has no family here.
Dehghani Hossein Abadi's family owns a private construction and export company in Iran, Doyle said. The company has no connection to the Iranian government or any “nefarious" ties. She also noted that he had received his student visa to come to the United States after a long vetting process and the US government would have likely flagged any concerns about Dehghani Hossein Abadi, his family, or any potential problematic activities then.
The Times, quoting an unnamed government official, said officers at the airport had found evidence that Dehghani Hossein Abadi had family members affiliated with a company that had been subject to US government sanctions for providing weapons to Hezbollah. The Muslim organization is considered a terrorist group by the United States.
Customs officials said Tuesday that applicants, “must demonstrate they are admissible into the US by overcoming all grounds of inadmissibility including health-related grounds, criminality, security reasons, public charge, labor certification, illegal entrants and immigration violations, documentation requirements, and miscellaneous grounds."
But immigration lawyers said they are seeing more cases of customs officials at Logan Airport turning back Iranian students.
The refusal to admit the students comes amid deteriorating US-Iran relations.
US service members were injured after an Iranian attack on an airbase in Iraq this month — retaliation for the US killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani.
There were 12,140 Iranian students studying at US colleges and universities during the 2018-19 school year.
“This is not an isolated incident," said Susan Church, an immigration lawyer, who is representing Dehghani Hossein Abadi and others. “This is a pattern of misbehavior by this administration who lacks respect for the rule of law and lacks respect for the individuals here who are coming here to attend school and get a degree and further their knowledge."
In mid-September, Reihana Emami Arandi, 35, a Harvard Divinity School student, was denied entry to the United States after nine hours of questioning by customs officials.
In October, Mohammad Moradi, who was getting his doctoral degree in electrical engineering at Northeastern, was turned away at Logan upon returning from Paris after presenting a paper at a conference there.
Moradi had traveled back and forth to Canada to visit an uncle who is a Christian minister there in the months before without any problems, but he was stopped at Logan, said his attorney Laura Murray-Tjan.
Emami Arandi said she received little information about why she was turned away, except a suggestion that she wanted to stay in the United States, not simply study here.
Emani Arandi said she was eager to earn her religious studies master's at Harvard and had turned down other programs and quit her engineering job before she came to the United States.
But when she got to Logan, she was treated as “suspect not like a student." In addition to questions about her travel and work history, customs officials also asked her about the Quran she was carrying and political questions, such as what she thought about the recent explosion of oil fields in Saudi Arabia. When she went to the bathroom, two female government officials accompanied her, Emani Arandi said.
She was also not allowed to call Harvard for assistance, she said.
“I couldn't imagine such a thing could happen to me," said Emani Arandi, who is back in Iran and has asked a US district court judge to review the customs decision. “I couldn't imagine unfair behavior would happen to somebody who is coming to study."
Northeastern University officials said they are trying to get a better understanding of how customs officials are determining when to block the US entry of students with valid visas.
“It's unclear if this is a new policy or what is happening," said Jigisha Patel, an assistant general counsel at Northeastern.
Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said with so many colleges and universities in the Boston area, these immigration issues are worrisome.
“Think of the implications of this on a center of education like Massachusetts," Rose said. International students are unlikely to want to study here. “This is bad for our economy."

Texto completo: "Awkwafina Is Nora From Queens" debuts on Comedy Central. And Alejandro G. Iñárritu's "The Revenant" airs on FXM.
What's on TV
AWKWAFINA IS NORA FROM QUEENS 10:30 p.m. on Comedy Central. Awkwafina wakes up with a Fruit Roll-Up stuck to her lampshade in the first episode of this new series, a semi-autobiographical sitcom based on her life. She plays Nora, a 20-something with shaky career prospects who, when the story picks up, is living with her father and grandmother in Queens. The first season follows Nora as she tries to improve her life, a journey that involves much soul searching, family navigating (Lori Tan Chinn, BD Wong and Bowen Yang play relatives) and marijuana smoking. "Nora is where a lot of us find ourselves in our 20s," Awkwafina said in a recent interview with The New York Times. "What's next? Do you find success and suddenly it fixes everything? No, life is an open-ended question."
THE REVENANT (2015) 7:45 p.m. and 10:55 p.m. on FXM. Leonardo DiCaprio is up for the best actor award at next month's Oscars for his performance in last year's "Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood." It's DiCaprio's first nomination (and first role) since he won an Academy Award for playing a hardy mountain man in "The Revenant," Alejandro G. Iñárritu's 19th-century survival drama. The movie, based on the life of the frontiersman Hugh Glass, casts DiCaprio in the role, telling a revenge tale that begins with Glass being left for dead by a group of companions (Tom Hardy plays a particularly nasty one of them). It is perhaps best encapsulated by a scene in which Glass is mauled by a bear.
What's Streaming
THE LAST BLACK MAN IN SAN FRANCISCO (2019) Stream on Amazon; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Awkwafina has Queens; Jimmie Fails has San Francisco. Fails, an actor and San Francisco native, plays a fictionalized version of himself in this indie drama directed by Joe Talbot. The story centers on Fails's character's efforts to hold onto a home (in more senses than one) in a rapidly changing Bay Area. "It's a plaintive American narrative that here becomes an expressionistic odyssey, both rapturous and melancholic," Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. "In moments it feels as if Jimmie and his faithful artistic friend, Montgomery (Jonathan Majors, a mournful heartbreaker), are dreaming the movie into existence, pouring its surrealistic jolts and hallucinatory beauty out of their heads and straight into yours."
THE BLING RING (2013) Stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. Down the coast from "The Last Black Man in San Francisco," the Southern California teenagers at the heart of this drama are committing crimes and hoarding designer clothes. The movie concerns a group of young thieves who break into celebrity homes. (They're played by Emma Watson, Katie Chang and Israel Broussard, among others.) The film was directed by Sofia Coppola, who adapted it from a Vanity Fair article. Her version of the story, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The Times, has "a whiff of tabloid incredulity."

Texto completo: A mysterious virus has caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness. Now the infection has arrived in the U.S.
An outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has killed nine people and sickened more than 400, and has spread to several other countries. The first case outside of Asia was announced on Tuesday, as federal health officials confirmed that a Washington State man who had recently traveled to China had been hospitalized.
Here's a quick rundown of what we know so far.
What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their membranes, which resemble the sun's corona. They can infect both animals and people, and cause illnesses of the respiratory tract, ranging from the common cold to severe conditions like SARS, which sickened thousands of people around the world -- and killed nearly 800 -- during a 2003 outbreak.
How do I know if I'm infected with the new coronavirus?
Symptoms of infection include a high fever, difficulty breathing and lung lesions. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection very difficult. The incubation period -- the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms -- is believed to be about two weeks.
Little is known about who is most at risk. Some of the nine patients who have died also suffered other illnesses.
How was this virus identified?
On Jan. 8, The New York Times reported that Chinese researchers had identified a new coronavirus as the pathogen behind a mysterious illness that had sickened 59 people in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China.
The cases were linked to workers at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds. The market was later shut down and disinfected.
The number of human infections has grown dramatically, to more than 400 in China, and cases have now been confirmed in Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea. The nine people who have died from the illness were in Hubei, the Chinese province of which Wuhan is the capital, and many of the others infected had lived in Wuhan or traveled there.
On Tuesday, health officials announced the first case outside of Asia. They said the infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Wash., had recently traveled in the Wuhan region.

A day earlier, a top Chinese scientist said that the coronavirus was capable of spreading from person to person, adding to fears of a broader epidemic. The Chinese government warned that anyone who hides infections will be "forever nailed to history's pillar of shame."
Airports around the world, including some in the United States and Australia, are screening passengers from Wuhan. On Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced expanded screening measures in the United States.
The World Health Organization has called a meeting on Wednesday to decide whether to declare the coronavirus outbreak an international health emergency.
What is the source of the outbreak?
Animals are the most likely primary source of the outbreak -- but it is not clear which animals. Past outbreaks of similar illnesses, including SARS, were also believed to have emerged from live animal markets. Another coronavirus, MERS, is transmitted to humans by camels.
What can people do to protect themselves?
Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that travelers to China should "absolutely" avoid live animal markets, and keep their distance from any animals in rural areas. He reiterated that travelers should practice "good hand hygiene," and try to avoid anyone coughing and sneezing.

Texto completo: A man in Washington State is infected with a new respiratory virus. Federal officials plan to expand screenings for the infection at major airports.
A man in his 30s in Washington State is infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, the first confirmed case in the United States of a mysterious respiratory infection that has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds more in Asia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Tuesday.
Federal officials also announced expanded screenings for the infection at major airports in the United States. In addition to New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, airports in Atlanta and Chicago will begin examining passengers arriving from Wuhan, China, for signs of illness.
The infected man, a resident of Snohomish County, Wash., developed symptoms after returning from a trip to the region around Wuhan where the outbreak began.
He returned from Wuhan on Jan. 15, two days before passenger screening was instituted at three major airports in the United States, but he had no symptoms at the time.
He read online about the mysterious new virus that causes fever and respiratory illness, and informed his doctors about his recent trip when he sought care on Sunday, federal officials said.
He was seen at a clinic in Snohomish County and is now hospitalized at Providence Regional Medical Center-Everett. Specimens from the patient were sent to the C.D.C. in Atlanta, and officials confirmed on Monday that he was infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, also called 2019-nCoV.
Health officials declined to identify the patient, but said that he has a mild case of pneumonia, is doing well and has been very cooperative.
Health care workers are also trying to identify people who may have had contact with the infected traveler, and are notifying some of the passengers on his return flight who might have been exposed. They will monitor those fellow passengers for fever and respiratory symptoms.
"We're very comfortable the patient is isolated and poses little risk to the staff or general public," said Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer at the Snohomish Health District, adding that the strict isolation practices were implemented in "an abundance of caution."
News of the first case of the virus in the United States surfaced as officials studied growing evidence that the disease can be transmitted from person to person, although it is not clear how easily.
"There is new information hour by hour, day by day, that we are tracking and following closely," said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the C.D.C.'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.
The C.D.C. has deployed staff overseas who are working closely with the ministries of health in China and Thailand. "The key issue we all need to understand is how easily and sustainably the virus is spread from human to human," Dr. Messonnier said.
Federal health officials plan to expand the screening of passengers arriving in the United States from Wuhan to five airports that are major international hubs. All travelers from the city will be funneled through those airports.
Screenings started on Friday and Saturday at New York's Kennedy International Airport, San Francisco International and Los Angeles International. Now they will be expanded to Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International and Chicago O'Hare International over the next few days.
Passengers from Wuhan planning to arrive in other cities will be issued new tickets taking them to one of the five screening airports, officials said.
The outbreak, which began in December in a seafood and poultry market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is spreading: Patients have been identified in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, as well as Taiwan, Japan, Thailand and South Korea.
On Tuesday, Chinese authorities confirmed that six people have died of the infection in Wuhan. Nearly 300 cases have been reported to date in China, and federal health officials said that number is likely to grow. Many of the patients lived in or traveled to Wuhan.
The World Health Organization will meet tomorrow to decide whether to declare the outbreak an international public health emergency. But information about the new virus is still thin, and it's not clear whether or how many Americans are at risk.

"There are still more questions that we don't know the answers to than things we do know," said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.
"For example, what is the source? We don't know exactly. The location likely was the live animal market, but we don't know the particular animal."
The more pressing and urgent question, he said: "How frequent is human-to-human transmission?"
"Could people with mild infections transmit this virus from person to person?" he added. "That all remains still under investigation."
The patient in Washington told doctors that he had not visited the animal markets in Wuhan, nor had he come into contact with anyone who was sick.
On Monday, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville changed its electronic prompts so that any patients coming in to its hospital, emergency room or clinics with a fever or respiratory symptoms will be asked whether they have been to China recently or have had contact with anyone who has recently traveled to China.
Hospitals around the country are likely taking similar steps, Dr. Schaffner said, in an effort to quickly identify infected patients and place them in isolation so they can be cared for safely by hospital workers, and so specimens can be collected for testing.
Dr. Schaffner cautioned anyone traveling to China to avoid visiting live animal markets and to keep a distance from all live animals, including domesticated farm animals. Travelers to China should practice lots of good hand hygiene, he added, and do their best to avoid anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Texto completo: With oral arguments coming on Wednesday, both sides of the long-running fight over vouchers for religious schools are preparing for a watershed moment for public education.
WASHINGTON -- A potentially landmark education case before the Supreme Court on Wednesday has pulled in heavy hitters on both sides of the school choice debate who are trying to shape a ruling that could end decades of wrangling over school vouchers and religious education.
Oral arguments in the case, Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, have attracted briefs from President Trump's Justice Department, which hopes the high court will bolster the administration's marquee education issue: public funding for private schools.
On the other side, Democratic state governments, school boards and teachers' unions argue that a ruling in favor of a disbanded voucher program in Montana could open the floodgates for publicly funded religious education while draining traditional public schools.
Such a decision would be a "virtual earthquake" in the public education system, said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers. She added that it would send money cascading away from public schools.
"It will basically change 200 years of practice," Ms. Weingarten said.
The case challenges a decision to shut down a program that provided tax breaks to donors who funded scholarships that families could use at private schools, including religious ones. Montana discontinued the program after a ruling by its high court found that it had violated a provision in its Constitution that prohibited the use of government funding, either directly or indirectly, for religious purposes. Such provisions, known as no-aid provisions or Blaine Amendments, exist in 37 states and were driven initially by anti-Catholic bias. They are now seen as the last line of defense against widespread acceptance of school voucher programs.
The conservative-leaning high court could finally settle whether vouchers blur the constitutional line between church and state.
Lawyers at the Institute for Justice, the libertarian law firm that is representing three Montana families, said the case could produce one of the most significant education rulings in the last half-century. The Supreme Court has ruled that states may include religious schools in publicly funded school choice programs, but a ruling that would essentially require it would be groundbreaking.
"If we win this case, it will be the U.S. Supreme Court once again saying that school choice is fully constitutional and it's a good thing," said Erica Smith, a senior lawyer at the Institute and co-counsel in the Espinoza case. "And that will provide momentum to the entire country."
Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed a $ 5 billion federal tax credit scholarship program that would allow states to adopt initiatives much like the one Montana struck down. Ms. DeVos, who sent her own children to private religious schools, tried to defeat the Blaine Amendment in her home state, Michigan.
"These amendments only serve to keep too many children away from a better education, including one that better aligns with their family's values," Ms. DeVos said in a statement.
However the court decides, education policy experts and court observers see an effect far beyond voucher programs.
Lawsuits could compel public agencies to provide comparable funding and benefits to religious schools if the agencies support other private schools. If the court rules that state prohibitions on the use of government funding for religious purposes are rooted in bigotry, plaintiffs could emerge to say other major issues, like the Electoral College, have the same roots.
"If it's unconstitutional to exclude private religious schools from a program that provides aid for public schools, it's hard to see where the line is drawn and where the neutrality principle ends," said Kevin Welner, the director of the National Education Policy Center and a professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder School of Education. "It's a fascinating Pandora's box they could open."
About 18 states offer tax credit scholarship programs -- which overwhelmingly serve low-income families or those of color -- and Ms. Smith said several other states have interpreted their provisions to prohibit the programs.
In 2017, the Supreme Court issued a narrow ruling in a similar case, Trinity Lutheran v. Comer, where it said Missouri had violated the First Amendment by barring religious institutions from a state-funded program to make playgrounds safer. In a footnote of the majority opinion, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. wrote that the case "involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing. We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination."
When Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, who has defended religious groups' access to public benefits and a school voucher program in Florida, joined the court in 2018, advocates on both sides of the choice debate anticipated that any ambiguity around that footnote would soon be settled.
In the wake of the Trinity Lutheran decision, Ms. DeVos said she would no longer enforce a provision in federal law that bars religious organizations from providing federally funded educational services to private schools. Last week, she proposed several more changes to enhance religious groups' access to federal funding, and in an opinion piece, she wrote that the department was eager for the Supreme Court to "put an end to the 'last acceptable prejudice"' -- Blaine Amendments.
Montana's tax credit, enacted in 2015, provided up to $ 150 to donors who supported scholarships "to provide parental and student choice in education." The state's Department of Revenue later determined that religious schools -- about 70 percent of Montana's private schools -- could not participate.
The Montana Supreme Court ultimately found the entire program violated the state's Constitution, and the state shut it down. The Institute for Justice will argue before the Supreme Court that the shutdown violated its clients' rights to free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.
Montana has argued that the "no aid" amendment in the state's Constitution does not prohibit any religious practice, nor does it discriminate against any one religion. While the provision dates to 1884, it was re-ratified in 1972 by delegates who stated that it was to avoid "religious entanglement" and to preserve funds for public schools. The decision to discontinue the tax credits for secular and religious schools was aimed at both goals, they said.
Where the state saw neutrality, Kendra Espinoza, the named plaintiff in the case, saw bias. Ms. Espinoza, a single mother of three girls who works three jobs, wants to use the program to keep her daughters in Stillwater Christian School, in Kalispell, Mont. She believes the decision to shut down the program was in part a "push to have every student in public education."
"If the program was there and it was struck down simply so that people of religious faith could not access it, then that's discrimination," Ms. Espinoza said in an interview with The New York Times last month.
Justice Department lawyers argued that the application of the constitutional amendment in Montana "penalizes parents who choose a religious rather than a secular school for their children."
Amicus briefs have poured in. Several public education groups, such as the AASA, the School Superintendents Association, wrote that at play was a "voucher scheme" that "shifts public funds away from the local public school, to the detriment of students who have no real choice but to remain."
Civil liberties groups, like Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the American Civil Liberties Union, argued in a brief that a ruling against Montana would force taxpayers to fund religious indoctrination and discrimination in schools. The groups cited curriculums and handbooks from religious schools that participated in the Montana program. One school said its biology students would "see the contradictions between what is popular science today and the truth of God's word." Another required its students to "come from a family that celebrates biblical values" and that at least one parent "be born again."
Choice-friendly research groups, like EdChoice, argued that the high court's intervention was necessary to resolve a "deep split" in lower courts.
"The families, taxpayers and communities that find themselves on the wrong side of the judicial divide will continue to be deprived of the substantial educational, fiscal and civic benefits that religiously neutral educational-choice programs provide," the groups wrote.

Texto completo: In a memo for the Trump team during the Russia investigation, the attorney general wrote that presidents who misuse their authority are subject to impeachment.
WASHINGTON -- Scholars have roundly rejected a central argument of President Trump's lawyers that abuse of power is not by itself an impeachable offense. But it turns out that another important legal figure has contradicted that idea: Mr. Trump's attorney general and close ally, William P. Barr.
In summer 2018, when he was still in private practice, Mr. Barr wrote a confidential memo for the Justice Department and Mr. Trump's legal team to help the president get out of a problem. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was pressuring him to answer questions about whether he had illegally impeded the Russia investigation.
Mr. Trump should not talk to investigators about his actions as president, even under a subpoena, Mr. Barr wrote in his 19-page memo, which became public during his confirmation. Mr. Barr based his advice on a sweeping theory of executive power under which obstruction of justice laws do not apply to presidents, even if they misuse their authority over the Justice Department to block investigations into themselves or their associates for corrupt reasons.
But Mr. Barr tempered his theory with a reassurance. Even without the possibility of criminal penalties, he wrote, a check is in place on presidents who abuse their discretionary power to control the executive branch of government -- impeachment.
The fact that the president "is answerable for any abuses of discretion and is ultimately subject to the judgment of Congress through the impeachment process means that the president is not the judge in his own cause," he wrote.
He added, "The remedy of impeachment demonstrates that the president remains accountable under law for his misdeeds in office," quoting from a 1982 Supreme Court case.
Mr. Barr has long embraced a maximalist philosophy of executive power. But in espousing the view that abuse of power can be an impeachable offense, he put himself squarely in the mainstream of legal thinking. Most constitutional scholars broadly agree that the constitutional term "high crimes and misdemeanors" for which an official may be impeached includes abuse of power.
But in a 110-page brief on Monday, Mr. Trump's impeachment team -- led by Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel and a former aide to Mr. Barr in the first Bush administration, and Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow -- portrayed the article of impeachment claiming that Mr. Trump abused his power in the Ukraine affair as unconstitutional because he was not accused of an ordinary crime.
"House Democrats' novel conception of 'abuse of power' as a supposedly impeachable offense is constitutionally defective," they wrote. "It supplants the framers' standard of 'high crimes and misdemeanors' with a made-up theory that the president can be impeached and removed from office under an amorphous and undefined standard of 'abuse of power."'
Contrary to what Mr. Barr wrote 20 months ago, the Trump defense team also insisted that the framers did not want Congress to judge whether presidents abused their discretion and made decisions based on improper motives.
"House Democrats' conception of 'abuse of power' is especially dangerous because it rests on the even more radical claim that a president can be impeached and removed from office solely for doing something he is allowed to do, if he did it for the 'wrong' subjective reasons," the Trump team wrote.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Barr declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Trump's impeachment defense team did not respond to a request for comment about the tensions.
But Mr. Barr's view was no passing thought. His 2018 memo emphasized that presidents who misuse their authority by acting with an improper motive are politically accountable, not just in elections but also via impeachment.
Between elections, "the people's representatives stand watch and have the tools to oversee, discipline, and, if they deem appropriate, remove the president from office," he wrote. "Under the framers' plan, the determination whether the president is making decisions based on 'improper' motives or whether he is 'faithfully' discharging his responsibilities is left to the people, through the election process, and the Congress, through the impeachment process."
The result of Mr. Barr's main argument in 2018 and the Trump team's theory in 2020 is identical: Both posited that facts were immaterial, both in a way that was convenient to counter the threat Mr. Trump faced at that moment.
If Mr. Barr's obstruction of justice theory is correct -- and many legal scholars reject it -- then Mr. Mueller had no basis to scrutinize Mr. Trump's actions that interfered with the Russia investigation.
Similarly, if the Trump impeachment team's theory is correct, the Senate has no basis to subpoena documents or call witnesses. The lawyers are implying that even if Mr. Trump did abuse his power to conduct foreign policy by trying to coerce Ukraine into announcing investigations that could help him in the 2020 election, the Senate should acquit Mr. Trump anyway.
Another member of Mr. Trump's legal team, Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and criminal defense lawyer, is expected to make a presentation to the Senate trial this week laying out in detail the theory that abuses of power are not impeachable without an ordinary criminal violation.
Critics of Mr. Dershowitz's arguments have pointed to the seeming tension with comments he made in 1998, when he did not have a client facing impeachment for abuse of power: "If you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty, you don't need a technical crime."
In an interview this week, Mr. Dershowitz argued that his position now was not inconsistent with what he said in 1998, pointing to his use then of the phrase "technical crime" and saying that he is arguing today that impeachment requires "crimelike" conduct.
Mr. Dershowitz went further on Tuesday, saying on Twitter that he had not thoroughly researched the question in 1998 but recently has done so. "To the extent therefore that my 1998 off-the-cuff interview statement suggested the opposite," he wrote, "I retract it."

Texto completo: Two United Nations experts plan to release a public statement Wednesday morning "addressing serious allegations."
SEATTLE -- A forensic analysis of Jeff Bezos' cellphone found with "medium to high confidence" that the Amazon chief's device was hacked after he received a video from a WhatsApp account reportedly belonging to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, according to people familiar with the Bezos-ordered investigation.
After Mr. Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, got the video over the WhatsApp messaging platform in 2018, his phone began sending unusually large volumes of data, said one of the people, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.
The person said the investigators believed Prince Mohammed was used as a conduit because the message would not raise suspicions if it came from him.
The findings of the forensics investigation, completed on behalf of Mr. Bezos by Anthony Ferrante at the business advisory firm FTI Consulting, could not be independently verified by The New York Times.
After the findings were reported by The Guardian and The Financial Times, the Saudi Embassy denied that the Saudi government was involved.
"Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr. Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd," the Saudi Embassy said on Twitter. "We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out."
Mr. Bezos' security consultant, Gavin de Becker, had previously accused the Saudi government of hacking Mr. Bezos' phone, saying Saudi authorities targeted him because he owned The Washington Post. The Post has aggressively reported on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of its columnists, who was a critic of the Saudi government. The Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that Prince Mohammed ordered the killing.
Two United Nations experts plan to release a public statement Wednesday morning "addressing serious allegations" that Mr. Bezos was hacked by receiving a WhatsApp message "reportedly from an account belonging to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia," one of the experts, Agnes Callamard, said in an email.
Ms. Callamard, a specialist in extrajudicial killings, has been investigating Mr. Khashoggi's murder, and David Kaye, an expert in human rights law, has been gathering information about violations of freedom of the press.
In its statement, the United Nations plans to say that it is raising concerns over the hacking of Mr. Bezos's phone directly with the Saudi government, said a person familiar with the statement. The United Nations did not conduct its own investigation into the hack and is basing its statement on the FTI report, the person said.
The United Nations began looking into the situation in June 2019 when someone close to Mr. Bezos shared the forensic analysis with them, the person added.
Amazon and Mr. de Becker declined to comment. William Isaacson, Mr. Bezos' lawyer at Boies Schiller Flexner, declined to comment beyond saying that Mr. Bezos was cooperating with continuing investigations. Mr. Ferrante declined to comment through a FTI spokesman.
"All FTI Consulting client work is confidential," Matt Bashalany, a spokesman for FTI, said in a statement. "We do not comment on, confirm or deny client engagements or potential engagements."
The questions about who has had access to Mr. Bezos' phone erupted a year ago, after The National Enquirer reported that the tech executive was romantically involved with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor. At the time, The Enquirer published photos of the couple together, as well as intimate text messages.
Mr. Bezos later published emails from American Media, the parent company of The National Enquirer, which he said amounted to "extortion and blackmail." He suggested that the leaks of photos and details of his private life could have been politically motivated to harm him because of his ownership of The Post.
In March, Mr. de Becker accused the Saudi government of hacking Mr. Bezos's phone. In an opinion article in The Daily Beast, Mr. de Becker wrote that his "investigators and several experts concluded with high confidence" that the Saudis got private information from Mr. Bezos' phone and that he turned the evidence they had uncovered over to law enforcement authorities.
Mr. de Becker did not detail specific evidence they uncovered, nor did he detail whether the leaked information was published by The Enquirer. American Media denied any Saudi involvement, saying Ms. Sanchez's brother was the tabloid's sole source.

Texto completo: A day after they seemed to have brokered a truce, Joe Biden released a video criticizing "Bernie's negative attacks" and Bernie Sanders responded with one blasting his rival's record on Social Security.
MASON CITY, Iowa -- A day after former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders appeared to have brokered a truce after weeks of tension, Mr. Biden released a video on Tuesday night suggesting the Sanders campaign was engaging in "dishonest attacks" and Mr. Sanders responded with a video of his own criticizing Mr. Biden over his Social Security record.
The escalation between the two leading presidential candidates, who are competing for an overlapping slice of blue-collar voters here in the leadoff caucus state, came on the same day that an explosive interview with Hillary Clinton landed, in which the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee blasted Mr. Sanders in starkly personal terms.
Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, is required on Capitol Hill for President Trump's impeachment trial, and will have only limited ability to respond on the campaign trail and in local media markets with less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
"Bernie's negative attacks won't change the truth: Joe Biden is still the strongest Democrat to beat Donald Trump," says the video that Mr. Biden tweeted on Tuesday evening. The video is a social media spot with no money behind it, according to Mr. Biden's campaign.
In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has indeed been intensely critical of Mr. Biden: over his vote to authorize the war in Iraq, a record Mr. Biden has repeatedly mischaracterized; over Mr. Biden's long record on Social Security, issuing at least one false attack, according to the fact-checking outlet PolitiFact; and over his reliance on high-dollar donors, with a prominent Sanders surrogate claiming in an op-ed article on Monday that Mr. Biden had "a big corruption problem."
Mr. Sanders's campaign circulated the article. But by the end of the day, Mr. Sanders had told CBS News that "it is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared." Mr. Biden, who has also been critical of the Sanders campaign and claimed without evidence on Saturday that Mr. Sanders's team was promoting a "doctored" video about his Social Security position, tweeted his thanks.
Yet by Tuesday afternoon, the Biden campaign was fund-raising off the candidates' clashes, repeating a tactic from over the weekend.
"Bernie Sanders' campaign has unleashed a barrage of negative attacks, lying about and distorting Joe's record," read a fund-raising text message.
The video and the fund-raising appeal centered on a recent Sanders campaign claim that Mr. Biden had praised former Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Biden's 2012 rival for the vice presidency, in support of making cuts to Social Security. PolitiFact found that claim to be false and lacking context.
But it is the case that throughout his decades in public life, Mr. Biden, a former senator from Delaware, has supported freezes and proposals that worried some Social Security advocates.
"Bernie's campaign is not telling the truth," Mr. Biden's video says, going on to detail his record on the matter and to say that his current plan would protect Social Security and increase benefits.
In a statement Tuesday night, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, called the Biden spot the "first negative ad of the 2020 Democratic primary."
He added: "Let's be clear about why: He's trying to distort his decades-long record of proposing and voting for cuts to Social Security benefits for millions of people. Joe Biden is no defender of Social Security, and a negative ad won't help him outrun his record."
Mr. Sanders is seeking to cut into Mr. Biden's base of older caucusgoers in Iowa, seizing on an issue of great significance to them.
"Let's be honest, Joe," Mr. Sanders wrote as he tweeted out his own video on Tuesday, using Mr. Biden's own words from years ago about freezing Social Security. "One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you."

Texto completo: After a Boeing 737 crashed near Amsterdam more than a decade ago, an expert study that sharply criticized the manufacturer was never published by the Dutch safety authorities, and its key findings were either excluded or played down in their accident report.
On Tuesday, the Dutch Safety Board, which had commissioned the study, reversed course -- publishing it a day after The New York Times detailed the findings.
The Times's review of evidence from the accident, which killed nine people on a Turkish Airlines flight in 2009, showed the study's conclusions were relevant to investigations into two more recent crashes of Boeing aircraft that killed 346.
[Read The Times's investigation here .]
The study, by Sidney Dekker, acknowledged that the pilots made serious errors but also found that Boeing bore significant responsibility. It accused the company of trying to deflect attention from its own "design shortcomings" with "hardly credible" statements drawing attention to the pilots' mistakes.
A spokeswoman for the board had told The Times last week that Dr. Dekker's study was confidential. But in a statement on Tuesday, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the Dutch board, said the study had been posted online because the board's "current practices" had changed. "We now publish as much as possible," he said.
The board also defended its investigation of the 2009 crash, which involved a 737 Next Generation, or NG, a predecessor to the 737 Max. The more recent accidents involved the Max, which has been grounded since last year as investigations continue.
Mr. Dijsselbloem noted "the key question" for those investigations was whether lessons from 2009 "were sufficiently learned by Boeing and the American authorities."
Multiple aviation experts who had read Dr. Dekker's study told The Times its findings had not been sufficiently incorporated into the final Dutch accident report. In addition, the Times learned, the Dutch removed or minimized criticisms of Boeing after pushback from a team of Americans that included the manufacturer and federal safety officials.
Jan Paternotte, a member of the Dutch House of Representatives, praised the study's release but called for a hearing of those involved, saying he believed he would secure the necessary support during a committee meeting on Wednesday. "Boeing has been capable of strong-arming outside parties if it serves the short-term interest of the company," he said. "When safety is at stake, that is a problem."
The Dutch board on Tuesday acknowledged that it had changed portions of its draft report after the Americans raised objections, but called that "standard procedure" and noted that the Americans' comments were included in an appendix.
"The Dutch Safety Board does its work in strict independence," Mr. Dijsselbloem said. "The Board decides independently on the outcome of its investigations, the content of its reports and its conclusions and recommendations."
A Boeing spokesman referred questions to the National Transportation Safety Board, which led the American team that commented on the Dutch draft report. An N.T.S.B. spokesman declined to comment.
The Federal Aviation Administration, which was also a member of the American team participating in the 2009 inquiry, said in a statement that it was "following a thorough process for returning the Boeing 737 Max to passenger service." The agency added that it was working with international safety regulators to review "proposed changes to the aircraft" as well as "recommendations from safety experts who have examined our certification processes."
The Dutch board's final report, released in 2010, focused blame on numerous mistakes by the pilots, including their failure to notice a dangerous drop in speed and their incorrect response to an alert warning of an impending stall. The report contained statements -- some nearly verbatim and without attribution -- that were originally written by the American team and further emphasized crew errors.
The Times found striking parallels between the accident and the 737 Max crashes. In both cases, design decisions by Boeing allowed a single faulty sensor to activate a powerful computer command. In both cases, Boeing had known of the potential sensor failures but determined that pilots would react correctly and recover the plane. And in both cases, Boeing didn't include information in the pilots' manual that could have helped them respond to the malfunctioning automation.
Boeing, the F.A.A and the N.T.S.B. noted that the system involved in the earlier accident differed significantly from the one blamed in the Max crashes. But aviation safety experts, including a senior F.A.A. official who was not authorized to speak publicly, told The Times that the similarities were noteworthy.
Dr. Dekker's report "should have woken everybody up," one said. Instead, "the issue got buried."

Texto completo: BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Iran acknowledged on Tuesday that its forces had fired two surface-to-air missiles at a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed this month near Tehran, confirming for the first time that more than one missile was launched at the jet.
The Iranian authorities also asked officials in the United States and France to send the equipment needed to decode the jet's flight data recorders, or "black boxes," a request certain to frustrate countries that have called for greater international involvement in investigating the disaster, which killed all 176 onboard.
The downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 on Jan. 8 came amid heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that included tit-for-tat military strikes, and after the killing of the top Iranian security commander, Maj. General Qassim Suleimani, in a United States drone strike at the Baghdad airport.
The plane was shot down the same day Iran fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq that house United States troops, in retaliation for the killing of General Suleimani. After days of denials, Iranian officials acknowledged that the downing was the result of "human error," prompting angry protests across Iran.
A preliminary report from Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, released on Tuesday, corroborated a video verified by The New York Times last week that showed two missiles, fired from a military site, exploding near the plane.
Iranian investigators had established that two Tor-M1 missiles had been fired at the plane, the statement said, adding that the investigation was looking into their effect on the crash.
The crash's victims included 82 Iranians, 57 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians, heightening calls for an international investigation. But many have accused Iran of dragging its feet, a complaint likely to be bolstered by the suggestion on Tuesday that the plane's black boxes would be analyzed in Iran instead of being sent abroad.
The Iranian aviation organzation said it had asked United States and French aviation authorities to provide the equipment needed to decode the data recorders on the Boeing 737 because it did not have the necessary technology.
"If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time," the agency said in its report. "Until now, these countries have not given a positive response to sending the equipment."
That appeared to contradict a statement by Hassan Rezaifar, a head investigator for the same organization, who on Saturday said the jet's data recorders would be sent to Ukraine at the request of the country's authorities.
It also appeared odd that Tehran would request help from the United States, a longtime adversary whose president has embarked on a campaign of "maximum pressure" against Iran, including stepping up sanctions that have prevented Iran from importing sensitive technologies.
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly called for Iran to hand over the recorders and accused it of violating protocols for accident sites by bulldozing debris from the crash before the investigation was complete.
Canada, too, has criticized Iran's level of cooperation, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said Iran should give the recorders to France for analysis.
There was no immediate comment from officials in the United States, Canada or Ukraine about Iran's equipment request.

Claims by PG&amp;E Wildfire Victims Reach 80,000

Texto completo: The number of individuals seeking compensation from the utility more than doubled in just over two months.
A deadline extension and an aggressive effort to track down victims have doubled the number of damage claims against Pacific Gas & Electric over California wildfires started by its equipment.
A filing Tuesday related to the giant utility's bankruptcy case said more than 80,000 people were now seeking to tap into a relief fund projected to total $ 13.5 billion.
In his report, a court-appointed accountant charged with identifying and finding additional wildfire victims attributed the increased number of claims to, among other things, "grass-roots campaign efforts of the fire victims themselves."
Less than three weeks before the previous Oct. 31 deadline, The New York Times reported that about 31,500 victims had filed claims but that 70,000 others could lose out on benefits if they did not act quickly.
Judge Dennis Montali, who is presiding over the bankruptcy case, extended the deadline to Dec. 31. And Judge James Donato of United States District Court, who is responsible for estimating how much PG&E owes wildfire victims, said: "It would be a heartbreaking shame if even 10 percent of the eligible victims don't file claims for whatever reason. If we're talking about 50 percent not filing, that's -- that's intolerable."
Judge Donato suggested that "someone should be going door to door" to get victims to file claims.
The court appointed Michael Kasolas, an accountant, to do just that. He visited churches, attended community meetings, attached fliers to pizza boxes and ran advertisements in the hardest-hit areas to spread the word.
Steven Skikos, a court-appointed lawyer representing victims' interests, said fire victims had met and decided to help ensure that others were included in the compensation pool.
"Their relentless outreach to unincluded community members and the displaced fire victims helped change the dynamic of this case," Mr. Skikos said. "I don't think many realize how powerful a united fire victim community can be to bring positive change."
PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection last January after several years of extreme wildfires that were caused by the utility's equipment. The company estimated its liability in the tens of billions of dollars. The deadliest fire, the 2018 Camp Fire, killed 85 people and destroyed the Northern California town of Paradise.
PG&E's shareholders and bondholders, along with insurance companies, federal agencies and victims' representatives, have argued over how much each party should collect out of the bankruptcy case and who should pay the bills.
A hearing in the bankruptcy case is scheduled on Thursday. A significant part of the case has focused on determining how much is owed to victims.
Among the remaining issues is whether the funds set aside for victims will be entirely in cash or partly in PG&E shares. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is seeking to recoup up to $ 3.9 billion in federal and state emergency services related to wildfires caused by PG&E's equipment in 2015, 2017 and 2018.
FEMA has made similar requests of utilities in the past, but typically the funds recovered come off the company's bottom line. In this case, the issue has become wrapped up in the overall equation under which PG&E will emerge from bankruptcy.
The agency said last week that it did not seek to draw on the $ 13.5 billion expected to be set aside for wildfire victims in the bankruptcy. But it said those receiving benefits from the federal government and from another source for the same losses could be required to repay FEMA.
"FEMA is not seeking to take money away from wildfire survivors," Bob Fenton, the agency's regional administrator, said in an email.

Texto completo: A day before opening arguments in his rape trial, Harvey Weinstein's lawyers offered a first glimpse of their plan to undermine his accusers' credibility.
[ Read the latest updates on the Weinstein trial. ]
From the start, Harvey Weinstein's lawyers have made it clear they intend to secure an acquittal in his rape case by destroying the credibility of his accusers.
On Tuesday, a day before opening arguments, they gave a first glimpse of that strategy, saying they would use a trove of emails to demonstrate that some of the women allegedly assaulted by Mr. Weinstein later bragged about having an affair with him.
Damon Cheronis, a defense lawyer, said Mr. Weinstein's team will point to dozens of "loving emails" between the once-powerful movie producer and his accusers to suggest the sexual encounters were consensual.
"What we will be able to show is that witnesses who claim Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted them also bragged about being involved in sexual relations with him," Mr. Cheronis said during a hearing in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. "They bragged about these things he allegedly forced them to do." The lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, immediately disputed that claim, calling Mr. Cheronis's characterization of the emails "blatantly inaccurate."
But the back and forth in court showed that the coming trial will not only delve into the complex issues of consent and power dynamics in the workplace, but will also ask the jury of seven men and five women to wrestle with the issue of sexual assault within an ongoing relationship.
In legal terms, rape can -- and often does -- occur within consensual relationships, such as an abusive marriage. Some victims choose -- or are forced by circumstances -- to maintain outwardly friendly relationships with their attackers.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, is charged with raping one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcing oral sex on a second woman in his apartment in 2006. Mr. Weinstein is also charged with predatory sexual assault, exposing him to a possible sentence of life in prison.
Prosecutors have signaled that they intend to portray Mr. Weinstein as a powerful producer who used his influence to force and manipulate women into having sex with him. But his lawyers have argued that it was Mr. Weinstein who was used by the women who have now accused him.
Revelations about Mr. Weinstein's treatment of women in The New York Times and The New Yorker set in motion the global #MeToo movement, a public reckoning about the harassment endured by women for centuries. The prosecution's case largely hinges on the jury believing the women's accounts; there is no physical evidence to support the allegations.
Six women will be called to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. Four of those incidents happened too long ago to be prosecuted as separate crimes, but prosecutors hope their testimony will show a pattern of predatory behavior.
Mr. Weinstein's lawyers have long made it clear that they intend to discredit his accusers by focusing on emails that suggest the producer's relationship with the women was consensual and had lasted long after the alleged crimes.
"The evidence will show the complaining witnesses sent dozens and dozens of loving emails to Harvey Weinstein," Mr. Cheronis said, adding that one woman gave Mr. Weinstein her new phone number and another sent an email saying she wanted the producer to meet her mother.
The judge overseeing the trial, Justice James M. Burke, told Mr. Weinstein's defense lawyers that they could talk about the emails during opening statements but could not show copies of them to the jury.
According to a 2018 defense motion, the woman who told the authorities that Mr. Weinstein had raped her in March 2013, who has not been identified, sent him an email on April 11, 2013 saying: "I hope to see you sooner rather than later."
The next day she wrote, "I appreciate all you do for me, it shows." And five days later, she wrote, "It would be great to see you later and catch up."
Years later, the woman continued to correspond with Mr. Weinstein, writing to him on Feb. 8, 2017, "I love you, always do. But hate feeling like a booty call."
Later on Tuesday morning, Mr. Weinstein lost his bid to move the trial to a different county, away from what his lawyers have called the "carnival-like atmosphere" of Manhattan. A state appellate court denied the request "in its entirety," clearing the way for opening arguments on Wednesday.
The decision by the Appellate Division, First Department, which is in Manhattan, ended Mr. Weinstein's 11th-hour effort to delay his trial and move it, perhaps to Albany or Suffolk County.
Last week, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers had argued to the court that the producer could not get a fair trial in New York City because of an "unprecedented media spectacle" that has included reporters and camera crews filling courthouse hallways and protests against Mr. Weinstein taking place on the streets outside.
Manhattan prosecutors called Mr. Weinstein's request "a transparent attempt to delay the proceedings" that ignored "the obvious fact that the public interest in the defendant and his case transcends the boundaries of New York County."
Alan Feuer contributed to this report.

A Needle in a Haystack? How About an AirPod in a Subway Grate?

Texto completo: Over 7,000 electronics items were found throughout the subway system last year. Earbuds are the most common thing lost.
Recently, after having dinner in Midtown Manhattan, I put on my AirPods Pro as I walked to the subway station. I began getting hot, so I gently pulled off my red beanie while at 58th Street and Broadway. Then it happened.
The AirPod in my right ear fell out. By the time I realized it, the headphone was about to hit the concrete. I tried to catch it, but it fell past my reach.
It bounced off a metal chair, then disappeared through a subway grate and into the abyss.
Many New Yorkers have nightmares of a fire escape ladder or scaffolding falling on them, or even falling into a pothole. But more and more often, the average New Yorker worries most about losing their AirPods, the ubiquitous white wireless headphones from Apple that cost at least $ 159.
From September to December of last year, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said that it had recovered 2,194 items dropped through subway grates -- 1,220 of them earbuds or AirPods.
AirPods are meant to discreetly fit in an earlobe and stay there, but they sometimes don't. Many people who own a pair eventually end up losing them.
Thousands of New Yorkers lose tech on the subway tracks or through a subway grate, an M.T.A. spokeswoman, Meredith Daniels, would tell me later. Would I join those thousands of people?
I cartoonishly frowned thinking about how the entire event happened in only a few seconds but felt longer as I watched, seemingly, in slow motion. I tried looking through the subway grate, but it was dark and I could not see below.
My brain started speeding through ways that I could retrieve the AirPod. Eventually I realized that I would need the M.T.A.'s help. And with the agency's reputation for being unreliable, I knew this was going to be a Hail Mary.
First, I walked into the train station and asked the woman in the subway booth for help. She told me to call 511 in the morning.
I asked if she meant 311, but she pointed to a sticker on the booth's thick plastic partition that read "511." I have been steadily riding the subway since 2002 and have never heard of 511.
I quickly learned that dialing 511 connects New Yorkers with the state's travel information line. Through a series of prompts, a person can be directed to rail and transit schedules and the lost and found, among other things. The service has existed since 2011 and is funded by the New York State Department of Transportation.
So at 7:30 the next morning, I called 511. A woman asked me where the grate was in order to make sure it was owned by the M.T.A. -- some belong to the owners of nearby buildings. I was lucky. My AirPod fell through an M.T.A. grate.
The woman asked me how quickly I could get to the grate. "Now," I told her. She then explained that an M.T.A. employee could get there in 45 minutes.
I arrived there 30 minutes after the call. But an hour passed and no one showed up.
Resigned to never getting the earbud back, I contacted Apple and was told it costs $ 90 to replace a missing or lost AirPod. I quietly resolved that I would not pay for a replacement that I would likely lose again.
Instead, I decided to buy some flowers at a nearby Whole Foods to pick myself up.
As I was waiting to pay for a bunch of eucalyptus and bright pink tulips, my phone rang.
"Hello?" I dourly answered.
"Where are you?" the voice answered. "I'm with the M.T.A. I am at the subway grate."
I dropped my flowers and eucalyptus and ran back over to the area. A man, who said his name was King, was standing over the grate. After I showed him where my AirPod had fallen, King opened the grate and climbed down a ladder on the inside.
Shortly after rummaging through leaves and paper, he poked his head out of the hole and extended his hand. He was holding my AirPod.
I gasped. King had slightly restored my faith in the M.T.A. I knew that my next train would probably be delayed, but in that moment I didn't care. The M.T.A. had taken care of me this time.
After I thanked King, he replied, "This is what I do."
I learned that King was right. Recovering lost items is one of the things the M.T.A. does.
Usually it works like this: When customers drop something onto the tracks, or less often through grates, they contact a station agent or someone at the booth, Ms. Daniels said.
"Track personnel are then dispatched to retrieve the item," she said, adding that customers do not always inquire about items that are found.
Items that are retrieved but are not claimed end up in the M.T.A.'s lost and found, she said.
But not everyone who loses something down a grate or on the train tracks is lucky enough to get it back. Last year, more than 7,000 cellphones, tablets, laptops and headphones were found throughout the subway system by M.T.A. staff members, Ms. Daniels said.
One afternoon, as I walked to The New York Times building with both of my AirPods tucked in my ears, it happened again -- but this time, not to me.
I watched as a man, mouth agape, appeared horrified as one of his AirPods fell toward a subway grate. But the AirPod was too big to fit through this one. The man, Jeremy Garfield, 46, picked it up off the sidewalk and glanced around in disbelief -- a look I recognized -- and kept walking.
I ran after him.
Mr. Garfield told me he would not have tried to retrieve his AirPod if it had fallen through the grate.
"There is no way, in that grate?" Mr. Garfield said to me incredulously. "I got lucky."

Texto completo: Algorithms are sending ads by American brands onto Russian disinformation sites.
Lenin is sometimes said to have predicted that capitalists would sell Russia the rope with which they would be hanged. Yet not even Lenin could have imagined Vladimir Putin's success in getting some of the largest Western companies to subsidize his disinformation efforts by advertising on his government-run "news" websites.
The top programmatic advertiser on Mr. Putin's Sputnik News site? The Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, through ads bought on behalf of Berkshire Hathaway's Geico insurance. Sputnik News peddles Kremlin propaganda on topics such as Syria and straightfacedly reports Mr. Putin's denials of interfering in other countries' elections.
Geico is hardly alone in financing propaganda through what's called "programmatic advertising," ads that are placed automatically by algorithms, without judgment based on the content or journalistic standards of the websites. Mr. Putin's leading disinformation arm, RT.com, attracted programmatic advertising from 477 companies and brands over a recent six-month period, according to data collected by Moat, an advertising technology service. Among RT.com's top 20 programmatic advertisers: Amazon, PayPal, Walmart and Kroger. For Sputnik, its 196 programmatic advertisers in addition to Geico included Best Buy, ETrade and Progressive Insurance.
These all-American brands don't intend to subsidize the Kremlin. The problem is that with programmatic advertising brands can target the kinds of audiences they want to reach online, rather than specifying, as they once did, on which websites their ads should appear. As a result, these ads inadvertently end up on all kinds of inappropriate sites.
It's hard to estimate the revenue the Russian disinformation sites earn from these programmatic ads. Based on web-traffic data from Similar Web, and assuming an average cost per thousand page views of $ 3, RT.com earned $ 5.1 million in programmatic revenues over the past six months, with its smaller Kremlin cousin Sputnik News earning less.
Whatever the amount, companies are supporting websites that are the very definition of corporate social irresponsibility. RT describes its role as encouraging people in other countries to "question more" -- that is, promoting divisiveness in the United States and Europe. It publishes falsehoods such as denying that the Russia-backed regime in Syria used nerve gas on its own people.
A new theme on RT is that the emerging wireless 5G technology causes cancer. RT also reports that 5G cell towers cause learning disabilities and nose bleeds in children. No research establishes these risks. (Russia is far behind in 5G, which may explain this line of disinformation.) Despite this scaremongering, telecommunications companies that depend on the success of 5G have advertised on RT, including T-Mobile, CenturyLink, Comcast and Vonage. Cisco has advertised on RT, even though it is investing heavily in 5G technology.
Even companies known for carefully protecting their brands have ended up advertising on RT, including Consumer Reports, AARP and Walt Disney. Ads for Mount Sinai Hospital, which is known for its work in oncology, have almost certainly appeared alongside articles about the supposed link between 5G and cancer.
It's not just Russian propaganda that benefits from online advertising. Many health care hoax sites thrive on revenue from inadvertent advertisers. A site called Real Farmacy also pushes the 5G-causes-cancer hoax. One of its headlines read, "5G From Space: Not One Inch of the Globe Will Be Free of Radiation." Its top 20 advertisers include the 5G-promoting telecommunications companies Verizon, Vonage and AT&T.
Among the top 20 advertisers on the site Healthy Holistic Living, which has promoted milk thistle as a cancer treatment, are Amazon, Citibank, Hertz and Hilton -- as well as the Navy Federal Credit Union. A site called Healthy Food House, which ran an article that said, "Our aim today is to persuade you that there is no such a disease as cancer, as it is only a B-17 deficiency," carried advertising from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Its top two advertisers were Amazon and Google.
A website perhaps appropriately called The Mind Unleashed, which blamed Israel for the Sept. 11 attacks and claimed that certain foods are better than radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment, ran advertising from Procter & Gamble, CBS and Best Buy.
Some advertisers have tried to keep their ads off inappropriate sites. Procter & Gamble stopped advertising on YouTube in 2017 for a year because its ads kept appearing alongside videos promoting pedophilia and white supremacy.
The broader problem, however, remains.
Some advertisers are trying a cure worse than the disease. Instead of deciding which websites to support with advertising and which to shun, advertisers use a black list of words like "Trump," "taxes" and "antitrust," keeping their ads off web pages that mention such topics. This amounts to a boycott of serious news.
Other advertisers such as JPMorgan Chase have had their staff try to decide which news sites are safe for their brands. However, the lists they compile can quickly become outdated because there are so many new purveyors of misinformation. The company I work for, NewsGuard, provides this service for a fee. And there are others coming into this field, including the Britain-based Global Disinformation Index, as advertisers recognize the dangers of buying space on disinformation sites. Finally, some of the big platforms, including Facebook and Google, offer options to advertisers to determine where their ads will appear.
Advertisers and ad agencies that limit their programmatic ads to trustworthy news sites do more than keep their brands safe: They also return advertising revenues to news publishers that badly need the support.
If this approach catches on, Mr. Putin will just have to spend more of his government's own money to promote its disinformation.

Texto completo: The Broadway premiere of Charles Fuller's 1981 drama finds premonitions of today in the story of a 1944 murder.
When Capt. Richard Davenport, a lawyer with the Provost Marshal General's office in Washington, arrives at a Louisiana army base to investigate a murder, he is the first black officer most of the men stationed there have ever seen. Their diametrical reactions to him -- the white officers shocked and hostile, the black grunts busting with pride -- tell you everything you need to know about race relations in the segregated military in 1944.
Well, not quite everything. As Davenport is about to discover in "A Soldier's Play," the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1981 drama by Charles Fuller, racism is a disease that infects whatever it touches. Even the murdered man, Sgt. Vernon C. Waters, is not immune, though black himself. He hates his own race so virulently that almost everyone, from the Ku Klux Klan to his own corporal, has a motive for killing him.
This provides "A Soldier's Play," which opened on Tuesday at the American Airlines Theater, the solid if programmatic structure of a police procedural: Interrogate, rinse, repeat. It also provides, or at least did for white audiences when it premiered, a pair of novel themes. Now less novel, they still remain news: Colorism has not gone away, nor has the military, long since integrated, stamped out racism among its ranks.
But the themes and the structure can sometimes seem at odds. Not, apparently, as originally produced by the Negro Ensemble Company, when Frank Rich, writing for The New York Times, called it "a mature and accomplished work." Nor in the excellent 1984 movie, retitled "A Soldier's Story," which uses plenty of close-ups to keep the focus on the characters instead of the plot machinery.
Onstage, though, the loud ticktock of the investigation too often drowns out the emotion -- an effect perhaps enhanced by the flattening of the genre brought on by endless "Law & Order" spinoffs and reruns. In any case, whether "A Soldier's Play" is a great stage drama regardless of its flaws is something its bumpy but worthy Broadway debut, directed by Kenny Leon for the Roundabout Theater Company, cannot answer. Despite some powerful acting, it is too distracted to make the case.
Davenport (Blair Underwood) does not have that problem; the one trait Fuller endows him with is ferocious attention to mission. (Underwood, in an otherwise unexceptionable performance, adds another trait -- pandering sex appeal -- in a gratuitous flash of well-toned flesh.) Though he drives the plot, he is almost a bystander to it, allowing the soldiers he questions to spin out their views of Waters (David Alan Grier) in flashbacks that sometimes have more flashbacks within them.
The views are not pretty. Waters -- played in the original and in the film by the hair-raising Adolph Caesar -- is part sadist, part eugenicist, and so determined to avenge his own powerlessness as a black man that he is willing to destroy other black men to do it.
Fuller has said he based the character, who commands a barracks of former Negro League baseball players, on the kind of person he encountered while living in the projects: "someone who wanted to be a king in a place that didn't need a king." But Waters, with his fixation on purifying his race of its "lazy, shiftless" "geechy" throwbacks, its "singin', clownin', yas-sah-bossin"' embarrassments, is no harmless martinet. Instead he is, in a way, magnificent, recalling the great, mysterious evil of military men like Claggart in "Billy Budd" and Iago in "Othello."
Grier is unable to achieve that grandeur here. Though he appeared in smaller roles in the original production and in the movie, and clearly understands the character, he is naturally too likable -- or his years in sketch comedy have made him seem so -- to convey a threat that is larger than Waters himself.
You get a sense of that threat more vividly from the men in his command, who have no way to defend themselves against the machinations of a maniac. As punishment for a minor offense, Waters strips one of them, Wilkie, of the stripes it took him 10 years to earn. Another, Peterson, gets badly beaten in an unfair fight that Waters provokes. A third, Memphis, is framed by Waters (in a separate incident) for a murder everyone knows he didn't commit.
The three actors who play these men -- Billy Eugene Jones, Nnamdi Asomugha and J. Alphonse Nicholson -- are excellent, but the production doesn't capitalize on their performances to build the show into a riveting ride. Transitions between scenes are especially awkward on Derek McLane's abstract barracks set and are sometimes further saddled with florid dance elements it might have been better to have a choreographer stage. (None is credited.) The deployment of music, mostly traditional songs and blues, is likewise erratic.
But if the power of "A Soldier's Play" is sometimes attenuated, it is at other times enhanced. Leon draws smart connections between Fuller's portrait of black men trapped in a system with no viable choices and the prison-industrial context of our time. When Wilkie suggests to Davenport that Waters's assailants were probably not Klansmen because his uniform was not defiled -- "They usually take the stripes and stuff off, before they lynch us" -- it now comes across as a double-barreled insight, both a clue in the case and a tiny poem of fatalistic despair.
Fuller could not have been thinking, in 1981, of the daily roll-call of dead black youth that horrifies us today, or the estimated one in three black American men likely to be incarcerated during their lifetimes. But he definitely had the fate of his race in mind. Though Davenport (it's no spoiler to say) eventually gets his man, wrapping the investigation up neatly and gaining the respect of at least one white officer (Jerry O'Connell) in the process, he also delivers, in a single tossed-off line -- a line cut from the movie -- Fuller's frightful kicker.
Here, Leon could not be clearer, and as Nipsey Hussle's "Perfect Timing" brings us into the present, that abstract barracks begins to look a lot like a jail, or a morgue.

Texto completo: The poor air quality is making equipment harder to operate, and some workers have had to take leave to fight fires. The irony was not lost on many in Australia.
SYDNEY, Australia -- Australia's biggest mining company, BHP, announced on Tuesday that coal output was down at one of its large mines. The reason? Smoke from the country's ferocious wildfires -- a crisis fed by climate change, which is caused in no small part by the burning of coal.
The reduced air quality in New South Wales, the country's most populous state, has helped slow the company's production of electricity-generating coal by 11 percent there, BHP said in a review of its midyear financial results.
"We are monitoring the situation, and if air quality continues to deteriorate, then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year," said the company, which ends its fiscal year on June 30.
The irony was not lost on many in Australia.
The country, which just endured its hottest and driest year on record, has been dealing for months with bush fires that have killed at least 29 people, ravaged tens of millions of acres, and left residents in its largest cities wheezing from the most polluted air in the world.
"You Can't Make This Stuff Up!" Terry Serio, an actor and musician, said on Twitter.
"I did roll my eyes," Bill Hare, chief executive of Climate Analytics, a policy institute, said in an interview.
The smoke, Dr. Hare said, was most likely a minor inconvenience in the supply chain for BHP, the globe's biggest mining company. But, he added, it served as a "wake-up call" to BHP that the world needs to wean itself off coal to avert the most damaging effects of climate change.
"You can see the mood is changing in Australia," Dr. Hare said. "Sooner or later, the companies are going to run out of social license."
A BHP spokesman said that smoke from the bush fires had reduced visibility and made equipment harder to operate at the Mount Arthur coal site 150 miles north of Sydney.
In addition, some employees have taken leave from work to protect their properties from fires or to serve as volunteer firefighters.
While the fires have affected production, the spokesman said, the slowdown was also the result of a shift to mining higher-quality products. But even as the company investigates options to reduce its climate impact, he said, coal will remain a major part of its energy production mix.
Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal, and the industry wields wide influence on the country's political leaders. The country has annual coal exports worth 67 billion Australian dollars, or about $ 45 billion, including to major nations like China, Japan and India.
Although Australia emits only about 1.2 percent of global greenhouse gases, its economic reliance on fossil fuel extraction makes it the sixth-biggest producer of fuels that release carbon. Those emissions are expected to double by 2030, according to a 2019 report from the United Nations Environment Program.
Under Australia's current conservative leadership, emissions have been rising, and renewable energy targets have stagnated, even as the government says it will meet its carbon reduction targets under the Paris climate agreement. Climate scientists say the targets were among the weakest of those proposed by developed nations.

Texto completo: After two years of exploring the country's food scene, our critic wonders what will increase its mark on the world.
What is Australian food? It's a question that sends me into fits of frustrated rage, as if there could be one simple explanation, one way to distill the taste and creativity and history of a country as large and diverse as Australia. But it is also the line of inquiry that has been the foundation of my assignment for the past two years, as critic and columnist for The New York Times in Australia: to explore and explain the food and restaurants for a global readership.
It's been an incredible two years. I've eaten wonderful Thai food in the middle of Australia's largest national park, sought out fantastic tacos in the suburbs of Adelaide and considered the pleasures of the country's emerging barbecue cookery. I've explored the glory of Australia's old seaside pubs, its emerging Afghan and Ethiopian and Sri Lankan and Indonesian chefs, and followed my nose and stomach into the hinterlands of northern New South Wales, rural Victoria and the wine country of Western Australia. Rediscovering my home country, though the lens of its restaurants, continues to be a gift and an honor.
In 2019, I was also assigned by Food & Wine and Travel & Leisure magazines to travel in search of the 30 best restaurants in the world. As we head into a new decade, I've been thinking about what makes a country particularly distinctive in the world, and where exactly Australia fits into that paradigm.
The globalization of the last decade has had an especially big impact on Australia. When I left Melbourne for the United States in the early 1990s, it was as if I had moved to another planet -- Australia was just gone from my life. The move back was the opposite: Thanks to social media, cellphones and a global network of chefs and writers, I'm almost as connected to America as I was when I lived in Los Angeles.
And Australia is more visible than it has ever been. The worldwide reaction to the country's current horrific fire season is a heartening reminder that our international connections are stronger than ever.
Australia's incredible slate of food festivals and events over the last decade has brought the world's food media and chefs to our shores in greater numbers. The support from the tourism and public relations industries is such that those guests are treated splendidly, and often leave as true believers, ready to spread the gospel of Australia to the world. And the country's current working chefs, bartenders and winemakers are undoubtedly the best-traveled generation of food industry professionals that Australia has ever seen.
That globalization is also the development that is likely to pose the most challenges for Australian chefs and restaurateurs who -- like it or not -- are now competing in an international arena.
So what does Australia need to bolster its growing reputation as a dining destination? Here are a few angles to consider:
Native Flavors
On the home front, the biggest story of the last decade in Australian food is that, after more than 200 years of ignoring the native flavors of this continent, non-Indigenous chefs and diners have finally woken up to the bounty that was always here. This is a development with international ramifications -- native Australian ingredients offer a whole new flavor palette, giving us food that is totally distinct from anything anywhere else in the world.
Interest in these ingredients is only growing, but I fear that the voices not being heard in this conversation are those of Indigenous Australians.
I'm not sure what it says about Australia that this progress has been most vigorously championed by non-Australians. The Danish chef René Redzepi was one of the earliest, loudest voices advocating native Australian ingredients, bolstered by his 2016 Noma pop-up in Sydney -- a 10-week residency that is often credited with igniting widespread excitement about native foods. In Australia, the two chefs most visibly working with native ingredients are Attica's Ben Shewry, who is originally from New Zealand, and Restaurant Orana's Jock Zonfrillo, a Scotsman.
Mr. Shewry pays tribute to the Aboriginal people from whom he gets his ingredients and knowledge, and Mr. Zonfrillo runs a nonprofit group dedicated to exploring and promoting native foods. But what I'd love to see more of in the coming decade is the inclusion and promotion of Indigenous voices, and more Indigenous chefs leading the way forward.
Exporting the Culture
Australian food culture has made its mark overseas in the last decade, most prominently with the rise of Australian cafes in New York City and beyond. But I'd like to see Australia export more than just high-end avocado toast and flat whites.
I believe Australia's pub culture is unparalleled; it would be nice to see some of that seep into the United States and European markets. And we are so far ahead when it comes to vegan dining (now often referred to as "plant-based," as Pete Wells pointed out recently in his end-of-decade essay) that Australia should be known as a pioneer in that rapidly expanding market.
In the coming years I'd love to see Australian wine gain a broader fan base, beyond the heavy shiraz and woody chardonnay it's known for, pushed by the changes taking place in that industry here. We should be known for our cold-climate rieslings, our biodynamic pinot noirs and our vast array of natural wines. Same goes for spirits, particularly whiskey and gin, which are now some of the best in the world but relatively unknown to anyone other than extreme booze nerds.
Distinctly Australian Dining
The thought that has arisen for me more than any other is that we should be leaning in to the things that make us unique, that we should be celebrating the restaurants that are decidedly Australian rather than imitating trends from other parts of the world.
If I have one widespread criticism of the high end of Australian dining, it is that so many restaurants considered to be our best could be located almost anywhere in the world. In this new reality, where restaurants are being compared globally and diners travel across time zones for the right meal, it is especially important to offer something distinctive.
Native ingredients aren't the only path to distinction. At Saint Peter in Sydney, Josh Niland has won well-deserved international attention for his groundbreaking work with seafood. Australia's multiculturalism has produced gems like Lankan Filling Station and Boon Cafe, restaurants that could exist only here.
That characteristic -- that a wine, restaurant or bar is uniquely Australian -- is perhaps the most important quality to which the country's chefs and producers might aspire. If done right, by 2030 no one will wonder: What is Australian food?

Texto completo: Deborah Dugan, who was placed on leave, said that the Recording Academy's lawyer sexually harassed her and that she had complained about financial and voting irregularities.
Deborah Dugan, the suspended chief of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammy Awards, said in a complaint to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on Tuesday that she had been removed as retaliation for uncovering a range of misconduct at the academy, including sexual harassment, improper voting procedures and conflicts of interest among academy board members.
Ms. Dugan's 44-page complaint details her clash with a number of powerful men at the academy during her tenure of just five months. But her accusations also represent an indictment of the academy itself, which has struggled to reform its reputation after coming under harsh criticism for its poor record recognizing women and people of color in the major categories.
The document, filed with the E.E.O.C.'s Los Angeles office and technically called a charge of discrimination, alleges that Ms. Dugan's predecessor, Neil Portnow, had been accused of rape by an artist, and that the academy's board had been scheduled to vote for a bonus for him even though all of its members had not been told about the accusation. The complaint has little detail about the accusation, but said that a psychiatrist had said that the encounter was "likely not consensual."
It also says that Ms. Dugan herself had received unwanted sexual advances from Joel Katz, a powerful industry lawyer who represents the Grammys.
Mr. Portnow, who has not been charged with a crime, did not respond to a telephone message seeking comment on Tuesday, and Mr. Katz disputed Ms. Dugan's account.
The various forms of behavior, Ms. Dugan's complaint says, were "all made possible by the 'boys' club' mentality and approach to governance at the Academy."
In response, the academy said in a statement: "It is curious that Ms. Dugan never raised these grave allegations until a week after legal claims were made against her personally by a female employee who alleged Ms. Dugan had created a 'toxic and intolerable' work environment and engaged in 'abusive and bullying conduct."'
The academy said that investigations into Ms. Dugan's conduct and the allegations she raised were ongoing, and that she "was placed on administrative leave only after offering to step down and demanding $ 22 million from the Academy, which is a not-for-profit organization."
In her complaint, Ms. Dugan called the academy's claim that she had demanded a $ 22 million settlement "flat out false."
Ms. Dugan, 61, who took over as the chief executive of the academy in August after eight years with Red, the nonprofit co-founded by Bono of U2 that works to combat AIDS and other diseases in Africa, also says in her complaint the academy's voting procedures are rife with irregularities that seemed to steer nominations to artists affiliated with board members.
For many of its award categories, the academy convenes committees of experts, including artists, to review the nominations pool and whittle down the choices to meet the number of slots on the ballot.
According to the complaint, the nominating committee, when finalizing the ballot for the 2019 award for song of the year, for example, chose as one of its eight final nominees a song that had initially ranked 18 out of 20. The artist behind that song, the complaint alleges, was allowed to sit on the committee and was also represented by a board member.
The complaint also says that the committees can add artists to the ballot who had not first been chosen by the general voting pool. For this year's awards, it says, 30 such artists were "added to the possible nomination list."
Ms. Dugan's ouster last Thursday -- just 10 days before the 62nd annual Grammy ceremony on Sunday -- stunned the music industry in what is usually its glitziest moment in the national media spotlight. It also threatened the academy's carefully curated message of reform.
The academy placed Ms. Dugan on administrative leave after what it said was "a formal allegation of misconduct by a senior female member of the Recording Academy team."
That allegation, according to Ms. Dugan's complaint, was made by a former assistant to Mr. Portnow, who had remained attached to Ms. Dugan until she hired her own aide. After finding the work of this assistant unsatisfactory, Ms. Dugan offered her a new position, but she refused it and took a leave of absence, the complaint said. Eventually a lawyer for the assistant sent the academy a letter accusing Ms. Dugan of "being a bully," as Ms. Dugan's complaint puts it.
By that point, Ms. Dugan's complaint says, the academy's board had begun to strip her of some of her powers. Harvey Mason Jr., a record producer who is the board chairman, sent Ms. Dugan a letter on Dec. 9, informing her that she was no longer permitted to terminate staff members without board approval, and could not assign any new initiatives or choose any outside counsel for the academy's legal work.
On Dec. 22, Ms. Dugan sent a memo to the academy's top human resources officer detailing her concerns, and two days later a lawyer representing her notified the academy that she "intended to pursue legal claims," according to the complaint filed on Tuesday.
In an interview with The New York Times before Ms. Dugan's complaint was filed, Mr. Mason and Christine Albert, the academy's board emeritus, said they were committed to changing the organization but that Ms. Dugan had been moving too fast, had not taken the time to understand how the organization functioned, and disrespected the staff by not listening to their opinions.
"What we expected was change without chaos," Ms. Albert said.
Ms. Dugan's complaint argues that the assistant's complaint was a mere pretext for dismissing Ms. Dugan after she reported problems at the academy and challenged the close business ties between the organization and two law firms that perform the bulk of its legal work, yielding millions of dollars in fees each year.
In her complaint, Ms. Dugan said that these problems began even before she took her place at the academy.
Last May, the complaint says, after Ms. Dugan had been selected for the job and signed an employment contract, Mr. Katz invited her to a private dinner the night before a board meeting. At that dinner, as Ms. Dugan wrote in her memo to human resources, which was attached to her E.E.O.C. complaint as an exhibit, Mr. Katz ordered "an outlandishly expensive bottle of wine," commented repeatedly on her appearance, called her "baby," and invited her to travel with him on his private plane to his many homes.
She said she told him she was not interested but he attempted to kiss her anyway. "Needless to say," she wrote, "I found his behavior disconcerting and utterly inappropriate."
At their dinner, Ms. Dugan wrote, she also pointed out to Mr. Katz that she wanted to hire an in-house lawyer to help bring its legal costs down.
The New York Times interviewed a colleague of Ms. Dugan's who said that Ms. Dugan had recounted the dinner in detail the next day and then continued to report further inappropriate behavior by Mr. Katz after that point.
In a statement, Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for Mr. Katz, said that "Ms. Dugan's allegations of harassment" and her description of their dinner "are false and Mr. Katz categorically and emphatically denies her version of that evening."
The complaint includes a brief response to Ms. Dugan's memo from the academy's human resources officer, which says that Ms. Dugan identified "serious issues that need to be investigated."
"Your conclusion that it is necessary to make these concerns known," wrote the human resources officer, Shonda Grant, "is an accurate one and one that cannot be ignored."
The E.E.O.C. has the power to investigate complaints and seek reforms or penalties if it concludes an employer has discriminated against an employee. If the commission finds no discrimination occurred or it declines to investigate, the employee can pursue her case by filing a lawsuit against the employer.

Texto completo: He regretted his role in the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and said he thought it had set the stage for Watergate.
Egil Krogh, who as part of President Richard M. Nixon's staff was one of the leaders of the secret "Plumbers" unit that broke into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, a prelude to the Watergate burglary that brought down the Nixon presidency, died on Saturday in Washington. He was 80.
His son Peter said the cause was heart failure.
In November 1973, Mr. Krogh, known as Bud, pleaded guilty to "conspiracy against rights of citizens" for his role in the September 1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding in Beverly Hills, Calif.
The Plumbers, a group of White House operatives, were tasked with plugging leaks of confidential material, which had bedeviled the Nixon administration. Mr. Ellsberg, a military analyst, had been responsible for the biggest leak of all: passing the Pentagon Papers, the top-secret government history of the Vietnam War, to The New York Times earlier that year.
The Plumbers were hoping to get information about Mr. Ellsberg's mental state that would discredit him, but they found nothing of importance related to him.
"We believed then that these leaks constituted a national security crisis and needed to be plugged at all costs," Mr. Krogh wrote in a 2007 memoir, "Integrity: Good People, Bad Choices and Life Lessons From the White House," written with his son Matthew. "But we were wrong, and the price paid by the country was too high."
Before his involvement with the Plumbers, Mr. Krogh, a lawyer and Navy veteran, was regarded as upstanding and reliable -- "the White House Mr. Clean," Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward called him in "All the President's Men." And after taking responsibility for his mistakes and serving four and a half months in prison, he rebuilt his reputation, resuming his law practice and speaking and writing on ethics.
In 2007, to mark the 35th anniversary of the Watergate break-in (in which he played no part), Mr. Krogh wrote an essay for The Times about the Fielding break-in, which he believed had established the mind-set for Watergate.
"The premise of our action was the strongly held view within certain precincts of the White House that the president and those functioning on his behalf could carry out illegal acts with impunity if they were convinced that the nation's security demanded it," he wrote. "As President Nixon himself said to David Frost during an interview six years later, 'When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.' To this day the implications of this statement are staggering."
Egil Krogh Jr. (the first name is pronounced EH-gil; the last name rhymes with "vogue") was born on Aug. 3, 1939, in Chicago. His father was a businessman, and his mother, Josephine (Wooling) Krogh, was a homemaker.
He grew up in Chicago, Seattle and St. Louis, and earned a bachelor's degree in 1961 at Principia College in Illinois. After three years in the Navy, he earned a law degree at the University of Washington in 1968.
He went on to work for a Seattle law firm in which John Ehrlichman, a family friend, was a partner. When Nixon was elected in 1968, Mr. Ehrlichman became White House counsel and brought Mr. Krogh onto the transition team. Mr. Krogh and another lawyer, Ed Morgan, were given the job of vetting nominees for cabinet and other posts in the new administration.
Mr. Krogh then coordinated the administration's drug initiatives, paying particular attention to drug use among the troops in Vietnam and the flow of heroin and other narcotics into the United States. In 1971 Mr. Ehrlichman asked him to tackle another problem: leaks like the Pentagon Papers. He and David Young, an aide to Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's national security adviser, were to lead the Plumbers unit.
"I felt deep loyalty to John Ehrlichman," Mr. Krogh wrote in his memoir, explaining why he agreed to the new assignment. "My being in the White House was in part based on 15 years of friendship between the Ehrlichman and Krogh families."
In August 1971, he attended a meeting at which E. Howard Hunt, later convicted in the Watergate scandal, suggested burglarizing Dr. Fielding's office.
"At no time did I or anyone else there question whether the operation was necessary, legal or moral," Mr. Krogh wrote in his 2007 Times essay. "Convinced that we were responding legitimately to a national security crisis, we focused instead on the operational details: who would do what, when and where."
Several other people were also charged in the Fielding burglary, including Mr. Ehrlichman, whose sentence on various charges was made concurrent with his sentence for conspiracy, obstruction and perjury in the Watergate case. Though the Fielding burglary turned up little about Mr. Ellsberg, Mr. Krogh believed it led directly to Watergate.
"The burglary set a precedent that two members of the Plumbers could rely on when planning and executing the Watergate break-in of 1972," he wrote. "They knew that under certain circumstances the White House staff would tolerate an illegal act to obtain information."
By then he was no longer part of the Plumbers; he had been removed from the team in late 1971 after objecting to a proposed wiretap related to a different leak. He was later named an under secretary of transportation, but resigned from that post in 1973 as the legal case against him was building.
He was the first member of the president's staff to receive a prison sentence; he was given two to six years but was released after four and a half months.
Mr. Krogh was disbarred in 1975 but was readmitted to the bar in 1980. Thereafter he concentrated on issues and clients related to energy.
Mr. Krogh's three marriages, to Suzanne Francis Lowell in 1963, Laura Lee Carkener in 1978 and Ann Horton in 1992, ended in divorce. In addition to his sons Peter and Matthew, from his first marriage, he is survived by his partner, Nancy Glenn Hansen; a son from his third marriage, James; a stepdaughter from his second marriage, Laura Dail; two sisters, Letitia Krogh Davis and Joegil Krogh Lundquist; and five grandchildren.
Mr. Krogh liked to tell the story of Dec. 21, 1970: the surreal day that, with Mr. Krogh's considerable help, Elvis Presley met Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. Presley was in Washington and seemed to think he could help with the war on drugs. He sought a meeting with the president, and Mr. Krogh made it happen, standing witness as Presley hugged Nixon, talked about playing Las Vegas, prodded the president to produce some gifts for his bodyguards and, famously, asked for and received an honorary drug agent badge.
Mr. Krogh wrote a book about the moment, "The Day Elvis Met Nixon" (1994). In a 2007 speech at the Nixon library in California, he called it "the one completely fun day I had on the White House staff."

He Was King of the Hill, And He Refused to Yield

Texto completo: He was talented and driven, sure. But Jeter was defined more by an unyielding ability to play the game, and carry himself, on his own terms.
Among the many traits that combined to make Derek Jeter one of the most admired and adored baseball players of his generation, there was talent, drive and focus -- and a good dose of stubbornness, too.
Opposing pitchers felt it, even when they had great stuff. If they found a way to beat him on a Friday, Jeter figured out a way to respond by Saturday. Backups of his with high aspirations saw it, too. For virtually all of his 20-year career, Jeter clung stubbornly to that shortstop position, molding it into one of the highest-profile jobs in sports, like quarterback of the Dallas Cowboys or striker for Barcelona.
Even when a superstar like Alex Rodriguez, the best shortstop in baseball, joined the team in 2004, he would be the one to move to third base. Jeter was staying put, because he was stubborn enough to believe that he was the best person to be at shortstop for the Yankees, a dirt kingdom he stamped as his own and guarded tenaciously.
That refusal to acquiesce helped make Jeter a five-time World Series champion, and on Tuesday it helped him become a first-ballot Hall of Famer, receiving the second-highest percentage of votes ever for a player, with 99.7. Only relief pitcher Mariano Rivera, Jeter's teammate, exceeded that, receiving 100 percent of the votes from the Baseball Writers' Association of America last year.
The Hall of Fame announced on Tuesday that 396 of 397 voters had put Jeter on their ballots. Not even Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio or Mickey Mantle received that much of the vote. But Jeter -- who never finished better than second place in voting for the American League Most Valuable Player Award -- did.
He was not widely regarded as the best or most dangerous player in any one season, but he was hypercompetitive and when an important game hung in the balance, Jeter so often produced the hit, the throw or the catch that led directly to a Yankees win.
"A lot of times it's mind over matter," Jeter said in a conference call Tuesday night. "Every time I was in a situation, I felt as though I was still playing Little League. I had fun with it. I enjoyed the competition. I didn't shy away from it. And I wasn't afraid of failure."
That refusal to concede anything was an integral part of Jeter's makeup, and sometimes even reporters covering the Yankees faced it, too. Jeter was always mindful of his role as a superstar on the most famous team in baseball, and was generally cordial, accessible and accountable.
But his competitive nature sometimes shone in interactions with the news media, as he refused to give ground on even the most basic lines of questioning, leaving some reporters just as frustrated as the pitchers Jeter used to beat on a regular basis.
Once, during a slow spring training morning several years ago, Jeter was dressing for practice at his locker in the back of the Yankees clubhouse, tucked strategically in an area removed from usual foot traffic.
The topic that day was whether the Yankees would keep their payroll below a preset limit, something unheard-of at the time. What had happened, Jeter was asked by a reporter, to George Steinbrenner's big-spending Yankees?
"Whoa, buddy, you don't think that's a lot of money?" Jeter asked, effortlessly swatting the question into foul territory.
The questioner would have to bear down. Of course it is, the reporter responded, but usually the Yankees are not bound by any financial constraints.
"How many teams spend more?" Jeter demanded to know as he rummaged through his locker.
Well, not many, the reporter answered, but this is the Yankees, after all. Shouldn't you have the largest payroll in baseball? Jeter, rapidly pulling on his socks in a manner intended to convey that the interview would end soon, said, "So, the team with the highest payroll always wins the World Series?"
Bang, there it was. Jeter was already ahead in the count in this interview, and then he sent the final question sailing into right field for a base hit. He even added a bit of a smirk, almost an early-morning version of his signature handclap at first base.
Exasperated and empty-handed, the reporter threw up his hands like a beaten pitcher and declared: "You know, this is why you are such a good hitter. You never give in. You absolutely refuse to give in."
Jeter laughed. He seemed to like the analogy. He knew he was stubborn and supremely self-confident, and he knew it was useful, both on and off the field.
"His confidence was contagious," Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said in a statement. "So often it felt that he would not be denied, and that belief rubbed off on his teammates, leading to so many victories over so many years."
Jeter also knew that writers who dealt with him on a daily basis -- and the fans who adored him -- wanted more from him: more insight into his personality, more details about his enviable lifestyle, more of everything. But in his usual determined and calculated way, he never relented on that front, either.
"I know I haven't been as open with some of you guys as you would have liked me to be over the last 20 years," he said in February 2014, when he announced his plan to retire at the end of that season. "But that's by design. That's just how I felt I'd be able to make it this long in New York."
His steady resolve helped him survive two decades in that pressurized environment, but good fortune played a role, too. He was raised by caring, intellectual parents and, after starring at Kalamazoo Central High School in Michigan, was drafted by the Yankees, rather than by the Houston Astros, Cleveland Indians, Montreal Expos, Baltimore Orioles or Cincinnati Reds. Those were the five teams that picked ahead of the Yankees in 1992 and passed on Jeter.
Who knows what his career would have been had he been picked by one of those teams? Maybe he would not have won five World Series, and maybe the Yankees would not have won the titles of his era, either. But those rings helped define who Jeter is above all else: a champion with remarkable longevity.
He had 3,465 hits, the sixth-most in the sport's history, and many of them were stunningly dramatic: His 3,000th hit for a home run in 2011. His November home run in 2001. His leadoff homer against the Mets in the Subway Series in 2000, to name only a few.
He left the game with a .310 career batting average, but perhaps even more impressive was that his postseason numbers were almost identical to those in the regular season. His batting average in the playoffs was .308. His on-base plus slugging percentage was .817 in the regular season and .838 in the postseason.
He stubbornly refused to concede, even for a moment, that he could not replicate in the postseason exactly what he had done the rest of the year.
"It's the same game," he said, "whether it's spring training or Game 7 of the World Series. It's still baseball."
He believes that. Don't for a moment try to argue otherwise.

Texto completo: Readers worry that it will not be fair and impartial and decry limits on evidence and media access.
To the Editor:
Re "McConnell Plans for Senate Trial on a Speedy Pace" (front page, Jan. 21):
In the Federalist Papers No. 65, Alexander Hamilton, talking about the reasoning behind giving the Senate the power to try impeachments, wrote: "Where else than in the Senate could have been found a tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the representatives of the people, his accusers?"
Stirring words, but Hamilton clearly did not foresee a situation in which the majority leader of the Senate, far from being independent, declared that he would take his lead from the president and that he was not impartial, despite having to take an oath that requires impartiality, and several of his fellow senators have expressed similar views. Dignity? Impartiality? Independence? Not this Senate.
John T. Dillon
West Caldwell, N.J.
To the Editor:
Because Chief Justice John Roberts has Supreme Court responsibilities in the morning and cannot begin his impeachment duties until 1 p.m., Mitch McConnell's compressed trial schedule would result in a trial that would go, with breaks, well beyond 1 a.m. Doesn't this amount to forced sleep deprivation for the jurors, not to mention the chief justice?
What's more, how can jurors be expected to process information efficiently and think rationally over a span of 12 hours extending beyond bedtime? Or is rational thought no longer considered necessary in trials?
I mean, really -- a trial held in the middle of the night? Who does that? Oh yes -- people in dystopian nightmares.
Vicki Riba Koestler
Alexandria, Va.
Editors' Note: After this letter was published online, the schedule for the 24 hours for each side to argue its case in the impeachment trial was extended from two days to three.
To the Editor:
Mitch McConnell and other Republican senators argue that the Senate should not allow new witnesses or documents in the impeachment trial of President Trump because the House should have gone to court to enforce its subpoenas. This argument is simply illogical. The House is not to blame for the absence of key evidence; the defendant is.
The Supreme Court ruled, in President Richard Nixon's case, that material requested as part of an impeachment inquiry must be produced by the administration. Mr. Trump's complete stonewalling of the House is illegal. As the branch charged with enforcing the law, the executive failed in its duty. The House did not.
Jonathan R. Wagner
Buda, Tex.
To the Editor:
Limiting news coverage to only Senate-controlled TV cameras is outrageous and undemocratic. Yet, when put in context, it simply follows through on Mitch McConnell's intent to collude with the administration's corrupt cover-up. At the outset of the trial Democrats should insist on a vote to overturn this insidious ploy.
Jim Tackett
New Haven, Conn.
To the Editor:
Whatever happened to Plan B, censure of the president? This would have a good chance of passing. Since the bar is now being set so high for "high crimes and misdemeanors," censuring would make the point and avoid impeachment. Too late now, or is it?
Carla Wallach
Greenwich, Conn.
To the Editor:
In any trial if the defendant employed the spouse of a judge or juror, wouldn't that constitute the basis for recusal of the judge or dismissal of the juror? Is not the secretary of transportation (Elaine Chao) the wife of one of the key jurors, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, and employed by the defendant, the president of the United States, serving at his pleasure?
Nicholas Marchelos
Buffalo
To the Editor:
Re "A Conservative Contrarian With High-Profile Clients" (news article, Jan. 18):
If Alan Dershowitz is, as he says, acting in defense of the Constitution, then he is doing so at the expense of democracy. His advocacy in this matter serves to enable a president who does not believe in freedom of the press, does not believe in coequal branches of government, and does not believe in the rule of law unless it suits his purposes.
I respect Mr. Dershowitz's desire to protect the Constitution, but the irony is that he will be doing it in service of a president bent on destroying it.

Saxophonist, composer spanned bebop to fusion

Texto completo: Jimmy Heath, 93, a tenor saxophonist whose sharp and lively compositions became part of the midcentury jazz canon - and who found new prominence in middle age as a co-leader of a popular band with his two brothers - died Sunday in Loganville, Georgia.
His grandson Fa Mtume confirmed his death.
Heath's saxophone sound was spare but playful, with a beaming tone that exuded both joy and command. But his reputation rested equally on his abilities as a composer and arranger for large ensembles, interpolating bebop's crosshatched rhythms and extended improvisations into fulsome tapestries.
He was a teenager touring the Midwestern dance circuit with the Nat Towles Orchestra in the 1940s when he became enamored with arranging. At first he could hardly read music, but he proved a quick study.
When a particular harmony struck him, he hounded his fellow horn players to tell him what notes they were playing, then pieced together the chords on sheet music. Before long he was writing for a 16-piece band of his own, whose lineup included future saxophone luminaries John Coltrane and Benny Golson.
His career in many ways tracked the life cycle of postwar jazz in the United States. After touring with dance bands, he moved on to the fresher, more cosmopolitan bebop style, playing in groups led by trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis.
Originally an alto saxophonist, he earned the nickname Little Bird for his ability to emulate the fleet playing of the bebop pioneer Charlie Parker, known as Bird. He soon switched to the tenor, partly to skirt the comparisons, and established himself as a central figure on the New York scene.
In the mid-1970s, when R&B and rock had eclipsed jazz's popularity, he founded the Heath Brothers with his older brother, Percy, a bassist, and his younger brother, Albert, known as Tootie, a drummer. That band welcomed the electric instruments and strutting rhythms of a younger generation into its own distinctive style, which hopscotched between straight-ahead jazz and soulful fusion.
Heath titled his autobiography, written with Joseph McLarin and published in 2010, "I Walked With Giants," a playful reference to his 5-foot-3 stature as well as to the fact that he spent much of his life working alongside the most lauded names in jazz.
Reflecting on his long career, Heath often said that although he never achieved as much renown as some of his contemporaries, he was satisfied. "You become an 'icon' when you're dead," he told NPR Music in 2014. "I always say I'd rather be an 'acorn,' and be alive."
Yet from the 1990s, he did enjoy recognition as a jazz eminence. In 2003, the National Endowment for the Arts named him a Jazz Master.
In 1993, his Verve album "Little Man, Big Band" was nominated for a Grammy. Also that year, he jammed with President Bill Clinton at a White House jazz concert produced by the Thelonious Monk Institute, where he served on the board of advisers.
Clinton borrowed Heath's saxophone to play on a blues number and, with Heath's help, found the right key. As Heath recalled in his book, "He stumbled, but he landed on his feet."

Gay civil rights leader could receive posthumous pardon

Texto completo: A decade before Bayard Rustin became a chief organizer of the 1963 March on Washington, the civil rights activist was booked into a Los Angeles County jail on suspicion of 'lewd vagrancy.'
On that night in January 1953, hours after Rustin had given a speech in Pasadena, Calif., police officers spotted him in a parked car, having sex with one of the other two men in the car. Rustin was sentenced to 60 days in jail and forced to register as a sex offender for the 'morals charge,' which was often used to target gay people in those years.
Rustin would ultimately become one of the key leaders of the civil rights movement. He advised the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on nonviolent tactics, helped organize the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott and helped create the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. But the arrest remained a stain on his record, nearly exiling him from the movement he helped build.
Now, on the anniversary of his arrest, lawmakers in California are asking Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) to posthumously pardon Rustin and 'right this wrong.'
'There's a cloud hanging over him because of this unfair, discriminatory conviction, a conviction that never should have happened, a conviction that happened only because he was a gay man,' said state Sen. Scott Wiener (D), chair of California's legislative LGBTQ caucus.
In a news conference Tuesday, Wiener joined with Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D), chair of the state's Legislative Black Caucus, to formally ask the governor for the pardon.
While the state has repealed many of the discriminatory laws that targeted black and LGBTQ people such as Rustin, Wiener wrote in a letter to the governor, 'we must acknowledge and make amends for the harm that California's past actions have had on so many people. Pardoning Mr. Rustin will be a positive step toward reconciliation.'
In response, Newsom released a statement saying he 'will be closely considering their request and the corresponding case.'
'History is clear. In California and across the country, sodomy laws were used as legal tools of oppression,' Newsom said in the statement. 'They were used to stigmatize and punish LGBTQ individuals and communities and warn others what harm could await them for living authentically. I thank those who are advocating for Mr. Bayard Rustin's pardon.'
Wiener came up with the idea over a breakfast with LGBTQ activist Nicole Ramirez, who has spent years seeking a U.S. postage stamp dedicated to Rustin. Ramirez said he has heard concerns from some officials that Rustin's arrest record could get in the way of the stamp approval process.
The stamp, Ramirez said, would help honor a leader who paid a steep price for living authentically as a gay man at a time when he could be arrested, fired and even hospitalized for his sexuality.
'For him to come and speak out and be openly gay, can you imagine that?' Ramirez said. 'He was subjecting himself to more than that arrest but to commitment to a state hospital.'
Ramirez met Rustin briefly during a march in Washington in 1987, shortly before Rustin's death. But at the time, Ramirez didn't know who Rustin was, he said.
For decades, Rustin has been overlooked as a key strategist of the civil rights movement, historians say.
'Early on, he wasn't so well known because the civil rights leaders tried to keep him in the shadows . . . they were fearful of being tainted by Bayard's gay sexuality,' said Michael Long, who wrote a young-adult book about Rustin and edited a collection of letters by the civil rights leader.
After his 1953 arrest, Rustin's career nearly derailed. He was forced to cancel all upcoming speaking engagements and resign from his position with a pacifist organization, the Fellowship for Reconciliation, Long said. He struggled to find work, and even began doing manual labor as a furniture mover, said Walter Naegle, Rustin's partner for the last decade of his life.
Naegle described the fallout from his arrest as a 'very dark period.'
'I remember him saying he would be walking around in the streets and checking phone booths for loose change,' said Naegle, now 70.
Rustin had been arrested before, for nonviolent protests that included refusing to leave white areas of local movie theaters and restaurants. But it was this arrest that was used to humiliate him and tarnish his reputation. While Rustin never hid his sexuality, he was deeply aware of the way it could affect his work.
In a letter written in March 1953, about three months after his arrest, Rustin wrote: 'I know now that for me sex must be sublimated if I am to live with myself and in this world longer.'
Rustin eventually landed a role with the War Resisters League, launching him back into the civil rights movement, Long said. But his sexuality continued to threaten to sideline him. In 1960, after threats from powerful Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (D-N.Y..), King pushed Rustin out of his inner circle, and Rustin resigned from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
But then, in 1963, as leaders planned the March on Washington, Rustin's longtime mentor, A. Philip Randolph, appointed him as a key organizer of the gathering. Rustin was tasked with steering the logistics of the massive event, coordinating between civil rights groups and recruiting off-duty law enforcement personnel to serve as marshals.
As the march approached, Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) attacked 'Mr. March-on-Washington himself' on the Senate floor, dredging up Rustin's arrest record from Pasadena.

But this time, the organizers of the march " including King " stood by Rustin. And even as his sexuality was repeatedly used against him, Rustin never shied away from it, Naegle said.
'They really picked the wrong guy,' Naegle said. 'The thing that separated Bayard from many people was he wasn't going to be silenced.'
In a recently released interview with the Washington Blade, Rustin said: 'It was an absolute necessity for me to declare homosexuality because if I didn't I was a part of the prejudice. I was aiding and abetting . . . the prejudice that was a part of the effort to destroy me.' He couldn't be a 'free whole person,' he said, living in the closet.
The week after the March on Washington, the cover of Life magazine featured not a photo of King, but of Randolph and Rustin, standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial.
More than two decades later, upon his death in 1987, Rustin's obituary was featured on the front page of the New York Times, identifying him as a civil rights activist and chief organizer of the March on Washington.
But it barely mentioned his identity as a gay man. In the obituary, Naegle was referred to not as Rustin's partner but as his 'administrative assistant and adopted son.'
It wasn't until recent years that Rustin began to receive recognition not only as a major civil rights leader but as a rare example of an openly gay leader at the time.
Ahead of the 50th anniversary of the 1963 March on Washington, Naegle traveled across the country organizing programs dedicated to spreading the word of Rustin's legacy. And in 2013, Obama posthumously honored Rustin with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, noting his role as an openly gay African American who 'stood at the intersection of several of the fights for equal rights.'


To Long, a pardon would be 'an affirmation of what Rustin knew all along: that he was not a criminal for being gay.'

Texto completo: Running is supposed to be one of the purest sports, but a technological arms race in shoes is raising questions about the integrity of competition in athletics.
Times have been tumbling in long distance road races and critics are suggesting some cutting-edge trainers are artificially boosting performances.
The concern is such that World Athletics - the sport's governing body - has convened a panel of experts to look at the legality in professional competition of a range of modern shoes.
Eliud Kipchoge wore a protype Vaporfly - the Alphafly - when he became the first person to run a sub two-hour marathon last year, although the time wasn't ratified by World Athletics because it was not set in a proper race.
Kenya's Brigid Kosgei also wore Nike's Vaporfly Next% when she beat Paula Radcliffe's 16-year-old women's marathon world record last year.
The shoes, along with similar designs from other brands, feature thick soles and carbon plates that act like springs.
'Universality of athletics'
While the Nike shoes are perfectly legal, an initial study in the journal Sports Medicine in 2017 suggested Nike's original Vaporfly 4% offered a boost in running economy - the measure of the amount of work a runner must do at a given speed - of about 4% compared with another Nike model and a top trainer from Adidas.
A New York Times study in 2018 and another independent review in February 2019 confirmed the findings. According to the New York Times, the top five fastest men's marathon times in history have been set by runners in Vaporflys.
World Athletics' rules say shoes "must not be constructed so as to give athletes any unfair assistance or advantage."
Rule 5 adds: "Any type of shoe used must be reasonably available to all in the spirit of the universality of athletics." The Vaporfly Next% are widely available at retail at a cost of more than $300.
The wording also says that shoes deemed as being non-compliant "with the rules or spirit of them" could be banned from competition.
In a recent statement, World Athletics said a working group, including officials, athletes, scientists and lawyers are reviewing shoe technology and the wording of the rules.
A decision is likely by the end of this month, but any change must be approved by the World Athletics Council, according to a spokesman. CNN has reached out to Nike for a comment but has yet to hear back.
'We must go with technology'
Kenya's Kipchoge set the official marathon world record of two hours, one minute, 39 seconds in Berlin in September 2018, and clocked 1:59.40 in the special INEOS 1:59 Challenge event in Austria. His support runners in Vienna were also wearing the Vaporfly shoes.
Kipchoge likened running a sub-two-hour marathon to Neil Armstrong's historic moon landing in 1969, and the Kenyan sees nothing wrong with the advancement in shoe design.
"They are fair," he told the Telegraph. "I trained hard. Technology is growing and we can't deny it - we must go with technology."
Swimming is another sport that has had to contend with the consequences of technological improvements.
At the Beijing Olympics in 2008, 94% of all swimming races were won by athletes wearing Speedo's LZR Racer swimsuits, according to Time Magazine.
After 17 world records fell at the European Short Course Championships later that year, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) changed its rules regarding the length and material of swimsuits.
"We're talking about performance integrity," said respected sports scientist Professor Ross Tucker, talking to CNN ahead of Kipchoge's sub-two-hour attempt in October.
"Is Kipchoge an outlier of immense athletic potential? Or is he a simply a very good runner who is benefiting from the immense improvements that his shoes provide? Perhaps both.

Texto completo: Pain is a very real thing; but so is medical bias.
I found out, firsthand, what I had read and heard about for a long, long time; Some doctors believe Black people have an ability to be strong and tough out painful conditions, and therefore do not give them the meds they need!
Racial disparities in all health outcomes are still commonplace in the United States, and one way this is apparent is the differences in how African Americans receive medication for opioid addiction treatment. In recent years, the opioid crisis has impacted the lives of millions of Americans. Oftentimes, those impacted by opioids are portrayed as white, middle-class Americans who receive treatment upon enduring non-fatal overdoses. According to PBS, "roughly 80% of American's opioid overdose victims are white." This means that people of color make up only 20% of opioid overdose victims. Despite this, much of the attention is on, and continues to be on, white victims of the crisis. Research has shown, conclusively, that African Americans are administered pain medications less frequently than whites.
There are those who would like to dismiss this claim and find all kinds of reasons to justify this pattern. Some attribute it to a natural tendency of African Americans to exhibit behavior that is described as "drug seekers." These are people who misuse prescription drugs most commonly seek prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines; drugs that, when abused, can get you "high."
However, even though there is a growing body of evidence to silence these skeptics, the institutional bias of prescribing less pain medications for African Americans persists. Recently, I found myself personally "victimized" by this experience in a clinical encounter.
Without going into too much detail (and taking up too much space in this column), following a minor laceration on my leg that was healing a little too slow for me, I made an appointment with a wound care doctor.
Upon being examined by the doctor, I described the history of the injury, how long ago it happened and how painful it was, especially at night. I emphasized that it had disrupted my ability to sleep for almost two weeks. I told him that my attempts to get relief from over-the-counter acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) were doing nothing. I expressed my concern about the possible kidney or liver damage that results from taking too much of either of these medications. The doctor, even tough listening intently to me, looked at me with suspicion, proceeded to clean and dress the wound, gave me a follow-up appointment in two weeks, and never addressed the pain.
Now, as you can imagine, even though I'm not a doctor, I knew enough to understand that based on my description of what I was dealing with, at some point the doctor should address the management of the pain in the healing process that I was experiencing.
I guess this doctor thought that I was a patient seeking drugs for myself, or to pass on to a family member or friend with dependency issues. Or maybe he thought I was trying to get drugs to sell on the street. Drug-seeking behavior is a commonly used, although poorly defined, term that describes a range of activities directed toward attainment of sought-after drugs. It seemed to be beyond his belief that I was genuinely just trying to manage my pain.
Opioids are narcotics, there were other options the doctor could have prescribed.
There are mounds of evidence to support this attitude by the medical establishment as it relates to African Americans and pain medications:
* A 2017 report released by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality stated, "Overall access to efficient health care was worse for Blacks than whites."
* A 2015 study African American children in the emergency room for appendicitis were less likely to receive any pain medication for moderate pain and less likely to receive opioids for severe pain.
* A 2016 study found that medical students believe that African American's nerve endings are less sensitive than white people's nerve endings. In other words, they felt that "Black people's skin is thicker than white people's skin."
As most of you know, or have heard, the opioid epidemic that has hit this country has fueled the drug addiction rate. That has received national attention in large part due to the impact it has in white communities. As crazy as it may sound, the medical community relies on a flimsy justification for this pattern of denying appropriate pain medication to African Americans. There is a report that has determined that denying prescriptions to African Americans for pain, 14,000 lives were spared from opioid abuse (or overdose).
As reported in The New York Times, "When the opioid crisis began to escalate some 20 years ago, many African Americans had a layer of protection against it. But that protection didn't come from the effectiveness of the American medical system. Instead, researchers believe, it came from racial stereotypes embedded within that system. As unlikely as it may seem, these negative stereotypes appear to have shielded many African Americans from fatal prescription opioid overdoses."
The only person who can judge the effectiveness of pain relief is the person who feels the pain, but African Americans' pain is at the mercy of medical bias. The struggle is real, and the struggle continues.

Rutgers to name its first Black president

Texto completo: Jonathan Holloway, the provost of Northwestern University, is expected to take over leadership of Rutgers University next week, becoming its first Black president, a school official said Sunday.
The decision will be announced Tuesday, following approval by the university's board of governors and board of trustees, the Rutgers official said, on the condition of anonymity because the hire was not yet official.
Dory Devlin, a Rutgers spokeswoman, would not comment but said that a joint meeting would take place Tuesday to elect "an executive-level position."
Holloway could not be reached for comment, and officials at Northwestern did not immediately return a request for comment.
If approved, Holloway will replace Robert Barchi, the current president, who Devlin said will step down at the end of the school year. Barchi is credited with expanding the student body, spending billions of dollars in constructing new facilities and merging Rutgers with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
The news about Holloway's impending appointment was first reported by NJ.com.
Before being named provost at Northwestern University in 2017, Holloway, 52, a scholar of African-American history and a former football player at Stanford University, was previously the dean of Yale College, holding one of the most prestigious positions in academia.
But during his tenure at Yale, the school faced student protests that attracted nationwide attention.
Holloway was at the center of a storm of student protests that were set off by an email in 2015 from a faculty member who suggested that students should be allowed to wear whatever Halloween costumes they wanted, regardless of whether they offended someone. Many students considered the email to be culturally offensive, and the controversy sparked debate about the university's history and the way it has dealt with race.
Holloway, who became the first Black dean of Yale in 2014, embraced some student demands, like calling for a more diverse faculty. But he was also criticized by some students who said he should have worked harder to address concerns about race on campus.
When he left Yale for Northwestern, he said protests played no part in the decision.
If Holloway's hire is approved, the number of minority presidents will nudge higher, although they still make up less than one-fifth of all college and university presidents, according to the most recent data published by the American Council on Education. Also, just 8% of the 17% of minority presidents are Black, Afro Caribbean or African American, according to the council.
Holloway is the author of several books, including "Confronting the Veil: Abram Harris Jr., E. Franklin Frazier, and Ralph Bunche, 19191941," and "Jim Crow Wisdom: Memory and Identity in Black America Since 1940."
According to Northwestern University, Holloway received a bachelor's degree with honors in American studies from Stanford University and a doctorate in history from Yale University. He began his academic career at the University of California, San Diego, before joining the faculty at Yale in 1999.

Texto completo: LAWRENCE, Mass. - Dionisia Ramos gets on the 37 bus twice a day, rooting through her handbag to dig out the fare and drop it into the slot, so it came as shock several months ago when the bus driver reached out his hand to stop her.
"You don't have to pay," he said. "It's free for the next two years."
Ramos had never heard of anything like this: Someone was paying her bus fare? At 55, she lives on a monthly unemployment check for $235. So saving $2.40 a day, for her trip to and from community college, past the hulking mills of Lawrence's industrial past - that meant something.
Since a pilot program began in September, use of the buses has grown by 24%, and the only criticism Ramos has of the city's experiment with fare-free transit is that it is not permanent.
"Transportation should be free," she said. "It's a basic need. It's not a luxury."
That argument is bubbling up in lots of places these days, as city officials cast about for big ideas to combat inequality and reduce carbon emissions. Some among them cast transportation as a pure public good, more like policing and less like toll roads.
The City Council in Worcester, Massachusetts' second-largest city, expressed strong support last week for waiving fares for its buses, a move that would cost between $2 million and $3 million a year in lost fares. And fare-free transit is the splashiest policy recommendation of Michelle Wu, a Boston City Council member who is expected by many to run for mayor in 2021.
Larger experiments are underway in other parts of the country. The cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Olympia, Washington, both declared that their buses would become fare-free this year.
The argument against fare-free transit is a simple one: Who is going to pay for it?
In communities where ridership has been falling, the cost of waiving fares may be less than expected.
Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence, intrigued after hearing his friend Wu speak about fare-free transit, asked his regional transit authority how much was collected on three of the city's most-used bus lines. The answer was such a small amount-$225,000-that he could offset it from the city's surplus cash reserves.
"What I like is the doability of this, the simplicity of it," Rivera said. "We are already subsidizing this mode of transportation, so the final mile is very short. It isn't a service people need to pay for; it's a public good."
Around 100 cities in the world offer free public transit, the vast majority of them in Europe, especially France and Poland.
A handful of experiments in the United States in recent decades, including in the cities of Denver and Austin, were viewed as unsuccessful, because there was little evidence that they removed cars from the road; new riders tended to be poor people who did not own cars, according to a 2012 review by the National Academies Press.
But in another sense, they were successful: They increased ridership right away, with rises between 20% and 60% in the first few months. That statistic accounts for its revival among a new wave of urban progressives, who see transit as a key factor in social and racial inequality.
"Think about who is using our buses: It's Black people, folks who live in communities where there are deep, deep concentrations of poverty," said Kim Janey, who was sworn in last week as the president of Boston's City Council and has proposed waiving fares on a key route through some of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
"I know what it's like to stand on the bus, all cramped up, so I won't be late to work," she said. "When I say more representation matters, that's why it matters. We will bring new ideas like free buses."
The idea also appeals to moderates in places like Worcester, the state's second-largest city, which is struggling to persuade residents to use its buses. Ridership has dropped by 23% since 2016, and the buses run half-empty, according to a report released last May by the Worcester Research Bureau, a nonpartisan policy group.
At a City Council meeting last week, a parade of citizens lined up to express support for a proposal to make Worcester's buses free for three years, as a pilot program. Revenue from bus fares is so low, and the cost of collecting them so high, that it could be replaced by an infusion of $2 million to $3 million a year.
"When I heard the news I sat bolt upright and said, 'That's a good idea!'" said Howard Fain, a public-school teacher, who said he often saw people struggling to dig out coins on the 7 bus.
"Even people who can afford to pay for dinner love a free buffet," he said. "Open up a cash bar and see what happens. We can draw people to public transit because people like free."
In Boston, the idea has run into resistance from officials who say the cost would be exorbitant.
"We have to have that conversation," said Mayor Marty Walsh, who was pressed for his position in an interview on WGBH, a Boston public radio station. "It's easy to throw ideas out there. But when you put ideas out there, we have to back it up with how do we actually pay for it. And that's going to be the key point to this."
Brian Kane, deputy director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which oversees expenditures on Boston's public transit system, said bus fares in Boston brought in $109 million in 2019 and $117 million in 2018.
"There's no such thing aş free," Kane said. "Someone has to pay. Boston has the highest-paid bus drivers in the country. They're not going to work for free. The fuelers, the mechanics - they're not going to work for free." Advocates of free transit have suggested that the cost could be offset by a gas tax increase; but replacing $109 million would mean raising the gas tax by 3 1/2 cents, Kane said. And all the while, he said, the system is straining to cope with the current demands.
"I hate to be the guy who says, 'eat your peas,"' he said. "But that's where we are."
Proponents of the idea argue that Kane's numbers are inflated and that the true replacement cost would be closer to $36 million. That gap, they say, could be covered by a 2-cent rise in the gas tax.
"That's where something controversial or impossible a few years ago now seems possible," said Stacy Thompson, the executive director of the LivableStreets Alliance, a transportation research group.
The Boston Globe editorial board, which endorsed the idea of making Boston's buses fare-free this month, suggested the cost could be covered by philanthropy.
Scott MacLaughlin, a ticket agent for the Merrimack Valley Transit Authority, which serves Lawrence, is already worrying about what happens when Rivera's two-year experiment in free transit ends, in 2021.
"You're going to take it away after two years? " he said. "When you give someone something for free and then you take it away, that's always going to be an issue."
And that, Rivera said with a smile, was exactly the point.
"To me, it's not a pilot," he said. "I want people to get used to it."

Texto completo: Headnote Nashville-style chicken looks to make its culinary mark
LOS ANGELES - At the bar, a man insisted on Hotville's hottest level of hot chicken ("Nashville hot"), though he hadn't tasted medium or even mild before. The cooks had seen this a hundred times, and when the chicken came out - a large, gleaming quarter of a bird - a teasing call came from the kitchen: "Hot enough for you?"
The man couldn't talk, but he nodded hard and flashed a thumbs-up.
Hot chicken, in its ideal form, is fried chicken in which hotness is inextricable from chickenness. The heat level varies and may be achieved with a sludge of cayenne, or a measure of ghost pepper, but it's usually tempered by softer spices and a bit of sweetness.
In Los Angeles, the dish often takes the form of fat chicken tenders, or tenders padded out in sandwiches, but the most traditional way to eat it is on the bone, with a slice or two of soft bread and some pickles.
Breast and wing, thigh and drum, you work your way around the meat so the seasoning grazes your lips and stains your cuticles and clothes, and leads to a kind of breathless, full-body high.
Kim Prir.ce, who opened Hotville in December, has run a hot chicken pop-up in Los Angeles for the last two years. She comes from the Nashville family responsible for the dish and grew up working at Prince's Ho: Chicken.
Her chicken is brined, floured and fried. She wouldn't say much more. "The method," Prince hesitated, "that's something we don't talk about."
But the result is juicy, seasoned to the bone, crisp and crimson. Hot fish is on the menu, too, with a few sides. The beans may seem too sweet before the chicken, but they'll be a relief afterward. And the mac and cheese has a browned, cheesy top that cooks are careful to spread out evenly among orders - a tiny gesture of fairness that I deeply appreciate.
Prince and her staff greet every diner warmly and immediately at the counter, handing them small menus printed on church fans, telling them about the poundcake and Key lime pie, and often apologizing because waffles are only available on weekends.
Hotville also offers an extra-hot chicken, off the menu, for thrill-seekers. "But I try to talk people off that ledge," Prince said. "I think it's pure punishment and pain."
The city was already rich with hot-chicken restaurants when Prince opened hers, on the edge of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw mall.
Howlin' Ray's, which started as a truck, now has absurdly long lines for its excellent chicken. Hawaiian Hot Chicken, one of several businesses that operate out of a carwash in the San Fernando Valley, stuffs tenders into shiny Hawaiian buns, giving it a distinctly Angeleno feel.
There are too many others to list. Did Los Angeles need another?
Yes. Hotville connects them all, drawing a straight line east to Nashville, Tennessee, back into the 1930s when Thornton Prince III - Prince's greatgreat-uncle, a farmer with a side hustle, and the architect of hot chicken as we know it - sold the dish out of his house.
Thornton Prince's hot chicken was viciously hot, fried in cast-iron skillets. It was difficult to take just one bite, even if that bite stung a little, and you could suddenly feel the pulse of blood in your lips. Even if you sniffled like a baby with a cold, you went back for more, because it was so good.
Eventually Prince opened a small restaurant. His grandniece, Andre Prince Jeffries, has run the business in Nashville since the 1980s. ("The women in the family have always carried the business forward," Kim Prince said.) But despite the secrecy of the family's technique and the deliciousness of its mythology, hot chicken grew into an icon, claimed and modified and adored by cooks from all over.
At Hotville, there's a fuzzy black-andwhite image of the Princes on the wall, taken in 1916 at the family homestead in Williamson County, Tennessee.
Kim Prince remembers being a girl of about 7 or 8, helping out at the restaurant. "I started as a pickle girl," she said. She would pull pickles from buckets all day, and go home with fingertips tinted green, the smell of dill and brine in her skin.
Sure, once a year, every year, someone at a food publication will declare this the Year of Hot Chicken. But eat at Hotville, and it's clear that 2020 won't be, and frankly neither was 2019, or 2018, because the thing about hot chicken is that it doesn't have a year.
Hot chicken is canon. Hot chicken is a timeless, boundless, endless source of pleasure, and it's been sustained by the Prince family for decades.
It's not having a moment, because a moment suggests an ending, and hot chicken doesn't end, it only begins, again and again and again, with someone's first crunch into chile-stained chicken and a cook calling out from the kitchen: "Hot enough for you?"

Texto completo: It would be his last slice of cheesy pizza, so he ate three on New Year's Eve. The next morning, Danny Swift, 25, a data scientist who lives in Manhattan, woke up hung over but determined to go vegan.
"I was starting to feel like a hypocrite for being a vegetarian for ethical reasons, but still supporting industries that abuse animals," said Swift, who stopped eating meat when he was about 5.
After reading about a campaign called Veganuary on Reddit, he decided it was time to give up cheese and other animal products - at least for January.
Move over Dry January (abstaining from alcohol) and Whole30 (no processed or refined foods). Veganuary, which asks people to ditch meat this month, has emerged as this year's trendy resolution.
The campaign was started in the United Kingdom in 2014 by Jane Land and Matthew Glover, a husbandand-wife team who met on a vegan dating site and were inspired by Movember (growing a mustache for men's health). Participants who pledge to vegan on the site receive daily recipes, tips and information about how a vegan diet benefits animals, the environment and our bodies.
According to Veganuary, 750,000 people from 192 countries have joined the pledge, with about half signing up for 2020. In advance of this year, the group expanded its efforts to the United States by hiring a director in Los Angeles and creating a dedicated website, us.veganuary.com.
Hollywood stars like Joaquin Phoenix, Alicia Silverstone and Mayim Bialik have lent their name to the cause. And on New Year's Eve, Natalie Portman urged her 5.9 million Instagram followers to take the pledge. "Fight climate chaos with your fork," she said.
National food chains have also gotten on board. Just Salad, a fast-casual chain based in New York City, is selling a limited-edition "Veganuary" salad made with organic sesame tofu, roasted mushrooms and a carrot-edamame slaw. Fresh Brothers, a pizza chain in California, is offering a free upgrade to vegan cheese.
"It's an arms race among fast-food chains to put out vegetarian burgers right now," said David ComanHidy, president of the Humane League, an advocacy group that seeks to end the abuse of animals raised for food.
Skeptics, however, argue that it is superficial to go vegan for just a month. Would you decide, for example, to only tell the truth or recycle for one-12th of the year? "I would say there are mixed opinions about people doing this for 30 days," said Ewelina Augustin, 25, who runs the online store Vegan Warehouse from Hoboken, New Jersey. "I can understand the pushback there."
But officials at Veganuary say that the campaign was designed to reach people who are not ready to commit to becoming a vegan year-round. "We know that the largest hurdles for people going vegan are convenience and taste," said Wendy Matthews, the group's U.S. director in Los Angeles. "Veganuary exists to help people discover delicious plant-based food and see how easy it is."
And even if someone doesn't commit to veganism, there are still benefits. Joseph Poore, an environmental researcher at the University of Oxford who has studied the environmental impact of food production, estimates that if Veganuary got 350,000 people to give up meat and dairy for month, it would reduce carbon emissions by 45,000 tons.
That's welcome news to Heather Ramsdell, 51, the editorial director of The Spruce, a lifestyle website based in New York City. "I am the person who literally brings my compost to somebody else's house," she said. "But I eat way more than my fair share of meat and dairy. It's such a huge, central part of my diet, and I don't feel great about it because of the negative impact on the climate."
As a personal challenge, she and her 13-year-old daughter, Eve Coleman, pledged to go vegan in January. "I now have about five new weeknight-type dinners and lunches in my repertoire, like being ambidextrous," she said. "Bacon is no longer my only benchmark of happiness."
While she hopes to eat less meat, she has no plans to remain vegan past January. "I'm trying not to dream about my first day back," she said. "I think I will end up wanting cheese. I will buy a bowl of mozzarella and eat it like an apple."

Partisan rules debate rages as Senate opens Trump impeachment trial

Texto completo: WASHINGTON — A divided Senate began the impeachment trial of President Trump on Tuesday in utter acrimony, as Republicans refused to commit to hearing from witnesses Democrats demanded and moderate Republicans forced last-minute changes to rules that had been tailored to the president's wishes.
The debate, convened just after 1 p.m. in a Senate chamber transformed for the occasion, marked the substantive beginning of the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. It was the culmination of weeks of rhetorical sparring between the two parties over whether and when to call witnesses and new evidence that Trump blocked from House investigators.
Standing in the well of the Senate, the Democratic House impeachment managers pleaded with senators, who were sworn to silence, to reject proposed rules from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would delay a debate over witnesses and documents until the middle of the trial, with no guarantee that they would ever be called.
The question of calling new evidence, said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the lead manager, was an “even more important question than how you vote on guilt or innocence."
“If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents, the opening statements will be the end of the trial," he said. “To say let's just have the opening statements and then we'll see means let's have the trial, and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug."
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, offered the first of several amendments to the rules — a proposal to issue a subpoena to the White House for “all documents, communications, and other records" relating to the Ukraine matter.
It was rejected on a party-line vote. A second amendment, to subpoena documents from the State Department, was also rejected by the same vote, demonstrating that Republicans are in firm control of their 53-47 majority in the chamber.
But the issue of witnesses is expected to resurface later in the trial, after opening arguments and a question period, when the rules allow votes on whether and whom to subpoena.
At the heart of the trial are charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress against the president approved last month nearly along party lines by the Democratic-led House. They assert that Trump used the power of his office to enlist a foreign power for help in the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals while withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House meeting for its president, and then stonewalled congressional attempts to investigate.
Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and amount to criminalizing a president's prerogative to make foreign policy decisions as he sees fit and to shield from Congress documents relating to the conduct of his duties. They also claim — in a break with most constitutional scholars — that because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law, Trump cannot be impeached.
But on Tuesday, the debate focused on whether his trial would be fair or not.
“This initial step will offer an early signal to our country: Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?" McConnell said.
But under pressure from Republican moderates, McConnell made some last-minute changes to the set of rules he unveiled on Monday, which would have squeezed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days and refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry into evidence without a separate vote later in the trial.
Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Rob Portman of Ohio, among others, objected to those proposals, which were a departure from procedures adopted unanimously by the Senate for the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton, on which McConnell had promised to model his rules. At a luncheon with Republican senators in the Capitol just before the trial was to begin, Collins and Portman raised their objections privately, according to aides familiar with the conversation, and McConnell submitted a revised copy of the resolution — with lines crossed out and changes scrawled in the margins — when it was time for the debate.
When his resolution was read aloud on the Senate floor, two days had been extended to three and the House's records would be automatically admitted into evidence, although McConnell inserted a provision not included in the 1999 rules that would allow Trump's team to move to throw out parts of the House case.
The historically rare debate was rendered even more unusual by Senate rules that prohibit senators from speaking on the chamber floor for the duration of the proceedings and empower the House managers and White House defense lawyers to argue aloud over the proposals instead. The effect was that on the trial's first day, the Senate chamber split cleanly into partisan factions, with the managers siding with Senate Democrats and Trump's lawyers taking the place of the Republicans.
Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, rose first and addressed the senators, urging them to support McConnell's proposed rules, which he called “a fair way to proceed" and getting in a jab at House Democrats' delay in transmitting the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
“We believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the president has done nothing wrong," Cipollone said, “and that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution."
Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, opened for the prosecution saying America's Founders added the remedy of impeachment in the Constitution with “precisely this type of conduct in mind — conduct that abuses the power of office for a personal benefit, that undermines our national security, and that invites foreign interference in the democratic process of an election."
Said Schiff: "It is the trifecta of constitutional misconduct justifying impeachment.''
The other lead lawyer on Trump's team, Jay Sekulow, retorted, “I'll give you a trifecta," outlining complaints over the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry process.
Locked in silence, senators were able to speak only before the proceeding began or during brief breaks.
“It is completely partisan. It was kept secret until the eve of the trial," Schumer told reporters Tuesday morning. “The McConnell rules seem to have been designed by President Trump and for President Trump, simply executed by Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans."
Specifically, he sought votes on records housed at the White House, State Department and Defense Department, and to compel testimony from four current and former Trump administration officials who were blocked from speaking with the House: John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert Blair, an adviser to Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a White House budget official.

‘I am a mom. I can do two things at once’: How Klobuchar plans to balance presidential bid, impeachment duties

Texto completo: As though she hasn’t been busy enough flying among the four early voting states in her campaign for for president, U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar will add another high-profile duty this starting Tuesday: impeachment juror.
Klobuchar is one of three remaining presidential candidates who are also members of the U.S. Senate, where the formal trial of President Donald Trump will begin Tuesday afternoon. That means she, along with U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, will be in Washington, D.C. for a historic duty, but one that will also take her away from campaigning — just weeks before the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
The other leading Democratic candidates — former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former hedge fund manager Tom Steyer — have no such restrictions on their time.
During her speech to a First Avenue rally Friday night, held on the first day of early voting in the Minnesota presidential primary, Klobuchar said she would depend on her family and Minnesota supporters to help the campaign while she is in Washington, D.C.
“I don’t know how many days this is gonna last,” she said. “I just know that I have a constitutional duty to do my job.”
“I just want you to think: What can I do for Amy today?” she said.
She later added: “I am a mom. I can do two things at once.”
Speaking to reporters afterward, Klobuchar said she doesn’t know what the impeachment schedule will be, adding that during the 1998 trial of President Bill Clinton, there were days when nothing was scheduled but that there was often little advance notice of when that would happen. “We’ll have to figure it out,” she said.
Some of the timing will depend on whether the Senate hears from witnesses, which she said she thinks it should. (“The last time I checked, you can’t have a trial without witnesses and evidence,” she said during her rally speech.)
“There is more and more stuff coming out and it would be really troubling if they didn’t have witnesses,” she said.
But she agreed that the trial will be a challenge for her campaign, more so than the snow and wind storm that might have kept supporters away from the Friday rally. “What I’m going to do is just keep going whenever I can, back to the early states,” she said. “I don’t need a lot of sleep, which is good.”
Klobuchar said she makes up for having less money than other candidates by making campaign appearances, up to 10 per day, and that her campaign would use telephone town halls and Skype to supplement appearances by her family and surrogates.
A recent New Hampshire poll had her in fifth place, at 10 percent, and she said she is adding endorsements in the first primary state, where she has already qualified for a Feb. 7 debate. She wasn’t aware of it when she took the stage Friday night, but she was co-endorsed Sunday along with Warren by the New York Times. After the Minneapolis rally Friday night, she left for yet another trip to Iowa.
On Monday, Klobuchar attended a Martin Luther King, Jr. commemoration in South Carolina while her husband John Bessler and daughter Abigail Bessler attended a holiday event in New Hampshire. After Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are the next states to hold their nominating contests; then comes Super Tuesday, on March 3, when 14 states — including Minnesota — will have primaries.
For all the drawbacks, Klobuchar acknowledged that are also political advantages to being a juror in the impeachment. A lot of public and media attention will be on the U.S. Senate, and she has been invited on national television programs because of her role in the trial, not as a candidate.
“That is going to be the big focus,” she said of the trial.
Klobuchar is also the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, where many of the battles over the proceedings could take place, including a rule that will keep news media away from parts of the Capitol where they have commonly had access.

A review of drug approvals by the agency from researchers at Harvard Medical School released Tuesday found that the FDA is approving drugs more rapidly with weaker evidence than it did in the past. That can be beneficial when it leads to needed medicines getting to market quickly, and I believe that’s the agency’s intent. As the study’s authors highlight, however, this emphasis on speed and flexibility could be eroding standards. It may be time for a gut check.
The gold standard for demonstrating efficacy — and the surest way of winning drug approval — is to demonstrate success in large, well-controlled studies that result in a hard outcome. But there are faster ways to get to market. In 1992, Congress created the accelerated approval program, which can green light medicines based on “surrogate” endpoints that predict rather than confirm benefit for patients, or those that have shown a shorter-term benefit. It’s one of several initiatives that have changed how the agency works. According to the study, 80.6% of approvals between 1995 and 1997 were supported by at least two pivotal trials. That number dropped to 52.8% between 2005 and 2017.
Companies that get accelerated approval have to prove their drug works with a confirmatory trial in order to gain full approval, but there’s no hard timetable no when that must be done. Thus, drugmakers often don’t hurry to conduct those tests. This is problematic at best, dangerous at worst.
Here’s just one case: In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. sought approval of a medicine to treat a rare muscle-wasting disease in young boys based on weak evidence from a tiny trial. In the face of significant public pressure, the FDA approved Exondys 51 even though one of its scientists called the treatment “an elegant placebo” in a report. Sarepta is selling the drug for over $300,000 a year but has continually delayed a confirmatory trial. It’s now years away from completion, and there have been no real consequences for the delay.
When companies do complete post-approval trials, it sometimes reveals a mistake. Eli Lilly & Co.’s cancer drug Lartruvo got accelerated approval in 2016. Lilly then pulled the medicine from the market last year after a larger trial found no benefit. That’s a rare outcome, but there are many expensive drugs on the market that have never moved beyond surrogate endpoints. A study of 93 accelerated cancer drug approvals between 1992 and 2017 found that only 19 had proved to help patients live longer in a followup trial.
There are some good reasons for faster approvals, as former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined in a Twitter response this week to a critical New York Times editorial penned on Jan. 11. Scientists are better at evaluating the safety of medicines and trial design has improved, for example. And advances have made it easier to create drugs that target small populations and have dramatic effects, Gottlieb wrote.
He makes good points. But the agency arguably hasn’t found the right balance between embracing advances and maintaining a high bar. It certainly has a ways to go on post-approval follow up. America is entirely unable to control the price of new medicines; the approval of marginal drugs has financial consequences.
The FDA will soon face one of its most important and controversial decisions yet. Biogen Inc. is seeking approval for the first purportedly disease-modifying Alzheimer’s drug — a medicine that could be used by millions of people and cost billions — without good evidence that it works. The agency often uses unmet need as a justification for shifting standards, and there’s no bigger unmet need than Alzheimer’s. That doesn’t justify an approval based on one failed trial and another that is a questionable success at best.
The agency will have to decide whether to review or approve the medicine in the next year or so. This choice is an opportunity to resist public pressure and move back toward demanding firmer proof of efficacy before drugs hit the market.

Texto completo: Too many liberal U.S. journalists whine for no reason about how oppressed and attacked they are as a profession. Just on Tuesday with the launch of President Trump’s impeachment trial, some complained about having to go through a metal detector, as if it was some sort of assault of press freedom. Yes, seriously.
But while we rightfully mock such instances of journalistic snowflakery, the sad persecution of left-wing dissident journalist Glenn Greenwald by the authoritarian president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, reminds us that the global threat to press freedom is still very real.
Greenwald's honesty is refreshing, even coming from a far-left perspective. He was brave in his willingness, as a progressive, to criticize the Left for madness such as the now-debunked Russia collusion hoax that suffused much of the liberal media for almost two years. I also appreciate some of the journalistic work that the publication he founded, the Intercept, does, and how it exposes both Democratic and Republican establishment misconduct.
Yet it really doesn’t matter whether you like Greenwald or not. Anyone who values press freedom should be appalled by what’s happening to him in Brazil right now.Tweet Tweet Greenwald lives in Brazil with his husband, who is a left-wing Brazilian politician, and their children. Since moving to the South American country in 2011, Greenwald has become a vocal critic of Bolsonaro.
For instance, Greenwald penned a 2014 piece decrying Bolsonaro as “the most misogynistic, hateful elected official in the democratic world.” So, too, the writer has helped expose political wrongdoing and abuses in Brazil, holding power to account in true journalistic fashion.
Here’s how the New York Times summed up Greenwald’s company’s stunning investigation:
The information published by The Intercept Brasil, a news organization co-founded by Mr. Greenwald, challenged the integrity of a wide-ranging corruption investigation that ensnared some of the most powerful figures in Brazil’s political and business establishment over the past five years, landing many of them in prison. Among them was the leftist former president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was jailed and prevented from taking part in a presidential race in which he had a large lead over Mr. Bolsonaro.
Now the Brazilian government is charging Greenwald with what seems to be trumped-up charges of “cybercrimes.” They claim he went beyond merely publishing leaked documents but actively engaged in criminal activity to obtain the information. Experts told the New York Times that nothing in the government's legal complaint supports that claim. Greenwald himself decried the charges as “an obvious attempt to attack a free press in retaliation for the revelations we reported about ... the Bolsonaro government.” From all the evidence we have right now, this indeed appears to be the case.
The entire situation is a fiasco. Greenwald deserves the backing of all journalists from across the political spectrum. And the many liberal journalists quick to sound the alarm and play the victim when they face criticism should realize that all the times they cry wolf hurt people who truly suffer abuses of press freedom.

Texto completo: Sen. Elizabeth Warren has promised to assign a federal task force to investigate the Trump administration if she is elected president.
The Massachusetts Democrat made the pledge on Tuesday, along with promising a host of other "anti-corruption reforms, democracy reforms, campaign finance reforms." She published an overview of her plans on her campaign website.
"On day one of my presidency, I will take aggressive steps to root out the corruption and incompetence of the Trump administration and to hold that administration accountable," Warren’s plan says.
"Donald Trump has run the most corrupt administration in history," Warren continues. "I will direct the Justice Department to establish a task force to investigate violations by Trump administration officials of federal bribery laws, insider trading laws, and other anti-corruption and public integrity laws, and give that task force independent authority to pursue any substantiated criminal and civil violations."
The New York Times endorsed Warren, 70, on Sunday night. The paper also endorsed Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, 59, noting that the two represent two different visions for the Democratic Party.
Warren is sitting in third place nationally in the Democratic primary for president, with 14.8% support. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders are ahead of her in national polling, according to RealClearPolitics.

‘Klo-mentum’: Klobuchar a dark horse two weeks out from Iowa caucuses

Texto completo: Amy Klobuchar isn't usually mentioned in the same breath as top-tier 2020 Democrats Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren. Yet, she's poised for a breakout in the nominating contest.
After stumbling during the Iowa debate, the Minnesota senator is getting enough good news that voters, seeking the most electable person to challenge President Trump in the fall of 2020, are giving her a second look.
Two weeks out from the first-in-the-nation caucuses on Feb. 3, Klobuchar, 59, was anointed the New York Times’s 2020 Democratic presidential candidate of choice alongside Warren, 70. Late last week, Klobuchar also broke the double-digit barrier for the first time in a New Hampshire poll, according to a 7 News/Emerson College survey of likely primary voters in the state. She did it again in Iowa with another Emerson poll in December.
From a national perspective, political commentator Christian Grose said the race was definitely experiencing some “Klo-mentum,” but the former corporate lawyer, who later became the chief prosecutor for the Minnesota county covering Minneapolis, still has to “turn this boomlet of interest into votes in the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary.”
“Her argument that she is more moderate and able to do well in the Midwest will be tested in Iowa. She has been a real fighter in the debates, and she is willing to hold events in Iowa even when bitterly cold, something a candidate from Minnesota is used to,” Grose told the Washington Examiner.
But New Hampshire-based Democratic strategist James Demers, a former supporter of New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, 50, was less optimistic.
“It amazes me that the three or four top-polling candidates have basically been frozen in the same positions for weeks. With that many people in the top tier, that makes it extremely difficult for someone polling in the second tier to break out. It’s not impossible for someone in the second tier to have a last-minute surge, but with three or four candidates polling higher, it becomes difficult to do,” he said.
For Demers, the Senate impeachment trial presents another obstacle for Klobuchar to overcome.
“I think we may find some candidates having to unload all of their financial resources on television and other advertising now just to offset being absent on the campaign trail while they do the business of the Senate,” he added.
Klobuchar will join Warren, as well as Sens. Sanders of Vermont, 78, and Michael Bennet of Colorado, 55, in deciding whether Trump, 73, should be forcibly removed from office for abusing his power by allegedly pressuring Ukraine into digging up political dirt on Biden, 77, and obstructing Congress’s investigation into the accusations.
The quartet of senators will be required to be in D.C. up to six days a week for an unknown period of time. While they can leverage their roles in the historic proceedings into appearances on cable news networks, Biden and another leading contender, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, 37, will be on the ground in Iowa, an advantage in a state where retail politics is king.
Although Sanders has chartered a jet in an attempt to make a campaign stop in Iowa on Wednesday after a full day in the Senate, Klobuchar is suspected of not having the cash on hand to compete with the second-time White House hopeful, even though she doubled her fundraising haul in the final financial quarter of 2019. The campaigns are due to disclose those numbers by Jan. 31.
During the Iowa debate, Klobuchar used her 17 minutes of speaking time to rip Trump and Republican senators over their handling of the impeachment process, to swipe at her opponents pushing for free college because it overlooks an anticipated trades shortage, and to riff on the issue of long-term care, sharing a personal anecdote. At the same time, she also forgot the name of her “good friend,” Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, when making the case for more women wielding political power.
Regardless, the New York Times last weekend revealed it was hedging its bets by endorsing both pragmatic center-left Klobuchar and populist liberal firebrand Warren.
Klobuchar continues to trail Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg, and Warren in Iowa, according to RealClearPolitics averages. Those four on average pull between 21% and 16.7% of the vote. Meanwhile, Klobuchar attracts 8.3% support. Similar trend lines are evident in New Hampshire, where the senator follows the first four by about 9 percentage points at 6%.

Texto completo: Michael Bloomberg's campaign manager conceded President Trump was on the precipice of reelection, complimenting his team's 2020 strategy.
Kevin Sheekey, who steered the billionaire media mogul and philanthropist to victory in his three New York City mayoral races, praised his Trump campaign counterpart, Brad Parscale, during an interview with Fox News.
"Brad is not running a national campaign. Brad is running a campaign in six states, and he's doing that exceptionally well. And right now, if the election was held, I think President Trump probably is reelected. And that's one of the reasons Mike Bloomberg got into this campaign," Sheekey said late Monday, referring to Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Meanwhile, Sheekey slammed the other Democratic 2020 presidential candidates for focusing on the four early voting states. Bloomberg, who announced his White House bid last November, is skipping the opening contests, instead targeting the 14 Super Tuesday states with primaries on Mar. 3.
Sheekey, the former Bloomberg L.P. executive, clarified reports Bloomberg committed to spending $2 billion to defeat Trump in the fall, regardless of who becomes the party's nominee. He also responded to the New York Times's editorial board opinion that his boss had spent $217 million to date on advertising in order "to circumvent the hard, uncomfortable work of actual campaigning," calling its categorization "ridiculous."
"Listen, I don't think Mike has said $2 billion. Mike hasn't even said $1 billion, which some people have — have quoted him on," he said. "The truth is, he has said, 'I want to run a campaign to get my message out, to make a difference in this country, and I'll spend whatever it takes.'"

Democrats not sure a woman can win against Trump

Texto completo: CONCORD, New Hampshire — Elizabeth Warren’s allegation that Bernie Sanders told her in 2018 that he did not think a woman could win the presidency in 2020 sparked outrage and allegations of sexism. But a portion of Democratic primary voters agrees with the sentiment.
Nearly 1 in 6 likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters in a Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll released Tuesday said that they did not think a woman candidate can win enough votes from the Electoral College to defeat President Trump in 2020. Another 6.6% were not sure.
Sanders, a Vermont senator, has denied telling the Massachusetts senator that he did not think a woman can win. He conceded on Sunday, though, that gender could be a “problem” for female candidates, similar to how race was a challenge for President Barack Obama.
Early state voters have overwhelmingly focused on Democratic presidential hopefuls’ “electability” versus Trump in a general election. A January Economist/YouGov poll found that 62% of likely Democratic primary voters and caucusgoers nationally would prefer a nominee who can beat Trump in a general election rather than one with whom they agree on most issues.
Just as they scrutinize the ages of Sanders, 78, and former vice president Joe Biden, 77, it seems some voters find that gender is also a characteristic impossible to ignore.
“It is obviously an uphill battle sometimes because there's still a lot of people that are concerned about gender,” said Deputy New Hampshire House Speaker Karen Ebel, who has endorsed Sen. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota. “But I for one haven't exactly encountered it, and I'm in a very purple state."
While voters might personally want a woman nominee, they worry what neighbors might think in a general election — particularly since many did not foresee Trump defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016. Many blamed her loss on sexism.
A few voters simply prefer a male president over a female one.
“I think a man should be the leader,” retired Florence, South Carolina, resident Jackie Myers, 67, told the Washington Examiner at a Joe Biden event in October. “A woman is fine, but you know, you can't take the place of a man.”
Hillary Clinton warned women candidates about the disadvantage their gender brings.
"Look, you can run the best campaign, but you're going to have to be even better than your best campaign to overcome some of the unfairness that will be directed at you as a woman," she recalled telling the female 2020 contenders in an interview published Tuesday.
In some ways, being a female candidate could be a boost. Democratic primary voters in early voting states often express that they would prefer a female candidate — or if not a woman nominee then a female vice presidential pick. Warren often says on the campaign trail that there is a lot a president can do “all by herself” to rapturous applause.
The New York Times on Sunday endorsed both Warren and Klobuchar, the two highest-polling candidates left in the race. “May the best woman win,” the editorial board said.
Ebel noted that despite concerns about women being electable versus Trump, Clinton won the popular vote in 2016.
"Women can pull a lot of factions together that perhaps men can't,” she said. "It should be viewed as an asset, not an issue."

No, Greta Thunberg is not as important as Trump

Texto completo: Whatever you think of her political views, Greta Thunberg is an impressive young lady. She travels the world advocating for action on an issue she cares deeply about. And she has a good sense of humor.
But I have a question: Why are we acting as though Thunberg's words have the same import as those spoken by President Trump?
Every time the two cross paths, we're inundated with media analysis that treats her statements as though they're equal in significance to those made by Trump. I get that some of this is quite amusing. Numerous media outlets posted her scowling reaction to Trump's arrival at the United Nations last September, for example. I have no problem with that. Rather, my concern is when the media inflate Thunberg's importance on the world stage.
We saw that on Tuesday when Trump and Thunberg separately addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ABC News previewed the two speeches with its headline observation, "All eyes on potential Trump vs Greta Thunberg showdown at Davos." The coverage grew after the two had spoken.
A BBC News headline proclaimed, "Davos: Trump decries climate 'prophets of doom' with Thunberg in audience." The outlet then analyzed Thunberg's own speech with the same level of detail as that afforded to Trump's. A similar response came from the New York Times, which offered paragraphs on Thunberg in its report on Trump's remarks, as well as an entirely separate report on Thunberg's own speech. The Guardian's headline told readers, "Davos 2020: Greta demands climate action but Trump blasts pessimists." CNN, CNBC, and Reuters, were just three others that did much the same.
It's quite silly to treat Thunberg in such a way. Yes, she has gotten some world leaders to meet with her, and the media love her. But Thunberg is not the prime minister of her native Sweden. Trump is the leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. Each of his statements offers insight into policies that have profound relevance for the global economy, international security, and any other issue Trump is addressing. At the practical level of policy, Thunberg is just a 17-year-old with a large soapbox.
So yes, praise Thunberg's commitment to her cause. But let's stop pretending these two voices are equally relevant.

Texto completo: The Iowa caucuses are only days away, and the race is tightening between four candidates: former Vice President Joe Biden; Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont; Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts; and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. As Sanders and Warren feud over the details of a 2018 meeting, the New York Times's editorial board gave both Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, an additional boost with a joint endorsement for the Democratic nomination. At the same time, President Trump’s impeachment complicates the race for Sanders, Warren, and Klobuchar, who have to spend time away from the campaign and on Capitol Hill for the trial in the Senate.
My guest today is Naomi Lim, a politics reporter with the Washington Examiner.
On today’s show, we’re going to discuss the background of the feud between Sanders and Warren, how the New York Times’s editorial board affects the Democratic primary, and what the Senate impeachment trial means for the senators running for president.
Hashing it Out is a podcast hosted by Siraj Hashmi, the Washington Examiner's commentary video editor and writer. Each episode includes a political guest to offer historical context of the news and politics of the day and insight into how we got to where we are. If you want to find the deeper meaning behind current events, then Hashing it Out is the podcast for you.

Meghan McCain brands New York Times a 'garbage publication'

Texto completo: Meghan McCain, a co-host of ABC's The View, slammed the New York Times after the newspaper released its endorsements for the 2020 election, calling the outlet a "garbage publication."

On Sunday, the New York Times editorial board unconventionally endorsed two candidates, Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the two remaining women in the presidential race. Warren, 70, and Klobuchar, 59, have campaigned themselves as ideologically different. The newspaper refers to Warren as "the standard-bearer for the Democratic left" and Klobuchar as "the standard-bearer for the Democratic center." McCain, 35, said she began "laughing her ass off" upon reading the endorsements.

"I’m sorry. Everyone in here is gonna have to choose one. This is not how this works, and also, on the final point of this, you chose both of the women. Just say, ‘I want a woman. I don’t really care about politics. I don’t care about anything else.’ Just double down on identity politics," McCain complained. “I think it is a huge act of cowardice on the New York Times, but at this point, I expect nothing less from this garbage publication."

The audience responded to McCain's comments with applause, but Joy Behar, another host of the program, interjected: "Wow. The New York Times is not a garbage publication — I have to say," she contended. “Well, this one incident. We don’t have to destroy the whole newspaper."

American military has grown averse to failure, US general says

Texto completo: FAILING UPWARD, QUICKLY: The most powerful military in the world should make more like one of the world’s poorest countries Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Gen. John Hyten is telling anyone who will listen.
“North Korea is the 115th most powerful economy in the world, 115 out of 192, one of the poorest countries in the world,” Hyten said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies Friday.
“But somehow over the last few years, North Korea has developed a ballistic missile program that can threaten its neighbors and threaten the United States, and a nuclear program that can threaten its neighbors and the United States, and they've done that — they've changed the entire structure of the world — with the 115th most powerful economy in the world,” Hyten said. “You want to know what's different about North Korea? They learned how to go fast.”
STUCK IN THE SLOW LANE: "When you look at our competitors, large and small, one of the things you find they have in common is they're moving very, very fast. And we are not," Hyten said, arguing that the U.S. military has become failure averse.
"If you want to go fast in the missile business, you need to test fast, fly fast, learn fast," Hyten said, and cited Elon Musk’s SpaceX which he noted had suffered some “pretty spectacular failures.”
“Did they stop? No. They instrumented the heck out of their capabilities. They learned from the failures. They launched rapidly. Again, they changed systems. They change subsystems. Uh, they go in a different, completely different direction. That is what North Korea has been doing,” Hyten said. “North Korea has been building new missiles, new capabilities, new weapons as fast as anybody on the planet."
FAILURE IS OUR FRIEND: “If the dictator of North Korea has learned how to accept failure, why can't the United States learn how to accept failure?” Hyten asked. “We need to understand what failure is and learn from those failures. Learn from the mistakes that we made. Move quickly from those mistakes.”
IT’S A NIGHTMARE: Hyten argues it’s not the case that the U.S. doesn’t know how to move fast, it’s the the Pentagon is slow to adopt the mindset of the private sector, especially in the area of software development.
“When you go into the commercial sector and watch how we build software, it’s so fast. You look at Google or Facebook or Amazon web services or, or any of the small startups in Cambridge and Silicon Valley and Seattle and here in Washington. It's just amazing.” Hyten said. “You ever walked into a defense contractor and watch us build software? Well, It is just a nightmare. And if you look at every one of our programs, it's a nightmare across the board.”

HAPPENING TODAY: NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg addresses the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs and Sub-Committee on Security and Defence today in Brussels The speech will be streamed live on the NATO website.
ALSO TODAY: President Trump is in Davos Switzerland for the annual World Economic Forum, and told the audience at the economic conference that America’s economic turnaround has been “nothing short of spectacular.”
Trump is scheduled to return to Washington tomorrow, as his impeachment trial begins in the Senate today.
ESPER HEADING SOUTH: Defense Secretary Mark Esper departs tomorrow for Naval Air Station Pensacola where he will be discussing new security measures in the wake of the Dec. 6 shooting in which three service members were killed and eight other people wounded by a Saudi student pilot.
“Going forward, we will put several new policies and security procedures in place to protect our people, our programs and our installations,” said Garry Reid, director of defense intelligence in a statement Friday. “These include new restrictions on international military students for possession and use of firearms, and control measures for limiting their access to military installations and U.S. government facilities.”
POMPEO: ‘WE DON’T WANT WAR’: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is wrapping up a trip to South America, where he met with Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido in Colombia, on the sidelines of the Third Western Hemisphere Counterterrorism Ministerial. Pompeo is scheduled for stops in Costa Rica, Jamaica, and Florida, before returning Thursday.
In a TV interview in Bogata, Pompeo argued that the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani has established deterrence and diminished the prospect of armed conflict. “The actions that we’ve taken over the past couple weeks have reduced the risk that there’ll be a war,” Pompeo said. “President Trump’s made very clear we don’t want a war. We don’t want a war anywhere, certainly in the Middle East.”
“The death of Qasem Soleimani, and the death of a senior leader of one of the militias there in Iraq – they provide an opportunity for a sovereign Iraq, and they reduce the risk of terror not only in the Middle East, but right here in Colombia.”
INDUSTRY WATCH:
— British defense and security giant BAE Systems PLC is buying U.S. defense technology assets worth close to $2 billion that became available by the merger of Raytheon and United Technologies, reports Bloomberg.
It’s the biggest acquisition in more than a decade for Europe's biggest defense company, which according to the Wall Street Journal has agreed to buy Collins Aerospace’s Military Global Positioning System business from United Technologies, and Raytheon’s Airborne Tactical Radios business, which makes military communications equipment.
— Raytheon has completed the first recertificated Block V Tomahawk cruise missile, reports Seapower magazine, which quotes Capt. John Red, the Navy’s Tomahawk program manager, as saying all Block IVs will be converted into Block Vs.
Red said the remaining Block III Tomahawks, which first entered service in 1994, are being withdrawn from use and are being “demilitarized.”
— Lockheed Martin has been awarded a $19.3 million contract modification to procure masts for Virginia-class submarine hulls for the Navy, according to UPI.com
The deal funds procurement of eight multi-function modular masts for Block V hulls for the Virginia-class submarine, the Pentagon announced last week.
“The Block V hull can be extended based on the requirements of the vessels' strike capabilities. Virginia-class submarines typically carry eight masts, including a snorkel mast and high-data-rate satellite communication masts as well as a radar mast,” said UPI.
SPACE FORCE: America’s newest branch of the military tweeted out a photo last week of its new blue embroidered name stripe and shoulder patch, featured on a regulation issue camouflage uniform. “The first #SpaceForce utility uniform nametapes have touched down in the Pentagon,” the tweet announced.
SPACE FARCE: The official tweet prompted a response from the entertainment world’s Space Force, the comedy series coming soon to Netflix, which tweeted out its own version of a uniform, which featured a Moonscape patten and red on black motif. “Here's what we're using. They'll never see us coming!,” said the verified parody account which goes by the misleading Twitter handle of @realspaceforce.

Texto completo: Hillary Clinton's revival of her 2016 primary spat with Bernie Sanders has enraged Democrats wanting to focus on defeating President Trump in the fall.
Clinton, 72, in interviews conducted for a documentary about herself, refused to commit to endorsing the Vermont senator, 78, should he become the Democratic 2020 presidential nominee.
Tommy Vietor, a Pod Save America co-host and a former Obama administration National Security Council spokesman who worked on the 2008 Obama campaign that beat Clinton during her first run for the White House, condemned her comments as "inexcusable."
"If Bernie wins the nomination, we all need to work our asses off to help him win. If someone else is the nominee, we all do the same for them. Don't kick up this bullshit right before Iowa, especially after complaining about Bernie's lack of support in 2016," Vietor tweeted.
Tweet
Vietor's sentiments were echoed by other Democrats, including Sanders-aligned strategist Peter Daou. He advised the former first lady, New York senator, and secretary of state during the 2008 and 2016 election cycles.
"This broadside against #Bernie is profoundly wrong. Especially since it echoes the erasure of his diverse coalition by pushing the 'bro' narrative," he wrote.
Tweet
Economics Nobel laureate and liberal New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman added it wasn't "OK" to encourage disunity.

Clinton made the remarks in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter to promote the four-part Hulu documentary set for release in March after the Feb. 3 opening Iowa caucuses.
"He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it,” she says in the series about the former House lawmaker and former mayor of Burlington, Vermont.
Those weren't the only harsh words she had for supporters of Sanders, dredging up allegations of sexism. Clinton's comments coincide with last week's drama involving Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70, who accused Sanders of saying in a 2018 private conversation that he didn't believe a woman could clinch the presidency. He has denied her claims.
“It's not only him, it's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women. And I really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture — not only permitted, [he] seems to really be very much supporting it," she told the Hollywood Reporter.
Sanders, on Tuesday, dismissed the flap ahead of the start of Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.
“Today we’re dealing with a monumental day in American history. We’re dealing with New Hampshire, we’re dealing with Iowa. It’s keeping me busy," he told reporters on Capitol Hill.

The New York Times endorsements are ridiculously out of touch

Texto completo: When I saw the New York Times recently ran an editorial endorsing a presidential candidate 10 months before the election and prior to any primary or convention, I could only think of the classic song Mr. Big Stuff.
In a world in which the elites are in retreat, how could a newspaper editorial board be so out of touch to think that anyone should care about their endorsement of a candidate?
I’m serious. I can think of few things less interesting to learn from a newspaper than the candidate they endorse for president and, certainly, before the main business of the campaign has even taken place. It’s like telling me what to think before I’ve had a chance to reach my own conclusion or giving me a lecture when what I needed was a list of important issues and the information to consider them. It’s telling me the answer before I’ve even had a chance to understand the question. It’s entirely the wrong approach, and, certainly, it comes at the wrong time.
In fact, one reason newspapers have been in decline, in my view, is their failure to adapt to a new role in the 21st century.
In my days as a college professor, if you had asked students what I do, I am quite certain they would have said that I “prepare and deliver lectures.” Yet, lecturing was the one thing I hardly ever did, because I had come to understand that it was not an effective learning tool. Students have far better and more interesting ways to get information than sitting in uncomfortable chairs in a classroom, listening to a person talk at them. The point of classroom teaching, I finally figured out, was to engage students and get them to think, not to tell them what to think.
Isn’t it high time for newspaper editorial boards to figure this out?
We are not sitting at their feet, waiting for them to tell us what to think or how to vote. Instead of giving answers, how about spending more time helping illuminate the hard questions? Rather than giving us a couple of opinion pages of elite answers, how about involving some thoughtful, ordinary people to reflect on their opinions, not merely through the occasional letters to the editor published days later?
Of course, this year’s endorsement was especially ridiculous because it was not an endorsement at all. Rather than choose a candidate, the New York Times endorsed two candidates: Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. Their argument for this was that Democrats face a hard decision this year between what they called “radical” versus “realist” points of view. While true, it hardly lets the newspaper off the hook from proposing a path through that difficult thicket rather than merely throwing up its editorial hands. Their endorsement of Klobuchar as the centrist ignored what polls have suggested are more interesting choices to voters, namely Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.
In an era of polarization, where politics now pits one side’s tirade against another, what we need is a way to find dialogue, not more diatribe. Especially 10 months prior to the election, we need to be figuring out the right questions, not jumping to someone’s version of the answers. It is time for newspapers to get out of the endorsement business and instead commit itself more fully to the information and dialogue business.

ANALYSIS: Establishment panic over Sanders could aid his 2020 prospects

Texto completo: After his 2016 Democratic primary loss to Hillary Clinton, many thought Bernie Sanders had hit his political high water mark. Now, they're venting frustration over his persistence and doggedly loyal base.
The Vermont senator's 2020 White House bid continues to poll well nationally and in the four states hosting the opening primary contests, starting with Iowa on Feb. 3.
The strong performance by Sanders, 78, in early polls had been attributed to residual name recognition carried over from his run against Clinton, the former secretary of state, senator, and first lady who went on to lose to President Trump that fall.
Sanders is competitive against 2020 Democratic rivals Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, and Elizabeth Warren, and his performance in recent public opinion surveys and strong fundraising numbers are escalating tensions within the party, with many members still reluctant to back Sanders, a longtime independent and socialist who suffered a heart attack in early October, as this cycle's nominee.
Yet Establishment complaints may just have the opposite result of their intended effect, energizing legions of Sanders fans.
Clinton herself kicked off the Sanders snubs, declining to say in an interview if she would back him if he wins the 2020 primary.
“I'm not going to go there yet. We're still in a very vigorous primary season,” she told the Hollywood Reporter.
A day-and-a-half earlier, the New York Times editorial board backed Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar over Sanders, who was mayor of Burlington, Vermont, from 1981 to 1989, then an independent House member for 16 years before joining the Senate in 2007.
The newspaper’s board acknowledged Sanders’s influence on the crowded field, helping once seemingly radical and fringe ideas, such as universal healthcare, free college, a higher minimum age, and paid family leave, find acceptance in mainstream Democratic politics. It admitted his criticism of the party's catering to “rich donors” over the middle class were fair and that he brought new voters into the fold. Yet, the board still had doubts about his health after he suffered a heart attack in October and, more broadly, his approach to politics.
“He boasts that compromise is anathema to him. Only his prescriptions can be the right ones, even though most are overly rigid, untested and divisive. He promises that once in office, a groundswell of support will emerge to push through his agenda. Three years into the Trump administration, we see little advantage to exchanging one over-promising, divisive figure in Washington for another,” it wrote.
And that is only the tip of the Democratic figure pile-on.
“If I were a campaign manager for Donald Trump, and I look at the field, I would very much want to run against Bernie Sanders,” Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said this month. “I think the contrast is the best. He can say, ‘I’m a business guy, the economy’s good, and this guy’s a socialist.’”
In addition, Sanders has tried to engage his opponents on the issues rather than through personal attacks, but his campaigns' swipes at competitors, and those of his ardent supporters, have rubbed some Democrats the wrong way. And they haven’t been afraid to call him out.
Sanders first distanced himself from a leaked campaign memo targeting Democrats leaning toward Warren, arguing she appealed only to affluent, well-educated members of the party who vote anyway, not expanding the base. The pair then broke a nonaggression pact to clash over their differing recollections of a private 2018 conversation in which Warren, 70, accused Sanders of questioning whether a woman could win the White House. Sanders has denied her claim, and CNN was trashed for ignoring his dismissal of the story when the topic was broached during last week’s Iowa debate. He then addressed gender in politics during an interview in New Hampshire over the weekend, reiterating how it was a “problem.”
Supporters of Sanders on the campaign trail and online haven’t shied away from confronting Biden, the former vice president on his Iraq vote or Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana Mayor, over his sway with black Democrats. But the candidate himself was forced this week to apologize under pressure for an opinion piece published by a top backer who leveled unfounded corruption allegations against the 36-year Delaware senator. The article had been pushed by the Sanders team.
“It's genuinely depressing how the 2020 campaign is just a repeat of 2016. How many [times] was Hillary called corrupt? Thousands? Millions? Absolutely huge downside to these few weeks before Iowa is reliving the 2016 nightmare,” tweeted Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a strident Clinton defender.
Tweet
Economics Nobel laureate and liberal New York Times opinion writer Paul Krugman added that the move was “a really bad look.”
“It illustrates everything that makes many Democrats distrust the Sanders team — and the buck stops with the candidate,” he wrote.
Tweet
But it remains to be seen whether Democratic Establishment pushback will steer the grassroots in another direction given a political environment in which the liberal wing is ascendant. Democrats who support Sanders, for example, have warned that many will stay home for the general election if a milquetoast candidate becomes the party’s next leader.
Fans such as Debbie Morrow, 68, told the Washington Examiner last fall that Sanders was “an inspiration” to the retiree from Spartanburg, South Carolina, because of his advocacy for "taking money out of politics and being more down to earth.”
Kilynn Lunsford, 38, a Philadelphia-based labor organizer working for Sanders, said after a rally in Davenport, Iowa, this month that he "galvanizes people" whenever they hear him speak.
"They understand that he's going to change this country for the better, and change the country for the working class, and they're not hearing that message from anyone else — ones that can actually hear that without all the media static manipulating what he's saying," she said.
Two weeks out from Iowa, Sanders currently trails Biden by an average of 8 percentage points nationwide, according to RealClearPolitics data. The senator averages 20.4% of the vote, to the former vice president's 28.4%.

TRUMP TRIES OUT NEW CLIMATE LINE OF ATTACK: President Trump on government-centric plans to combat climate change Tuesday:
“Fear and doubt is not a good thought process because this is a time for tremendous hope and joy and optimism and action,” Trump said in his address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “But to embrace the possibilities of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.”
“They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, mass starvation in the '70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s,” Trump added. “These alarmists always demand the same thing: absolute power to dominate, transform, and control every aspect of our lives.”
Trump touted record U.S. oil and gas production, decreasing dependence on foreign energy, and lower domestic energy bills, to suggest the U.S. can overcome threats like climate change.
Proclaims himself an environmentalist: Trump again declared himself an “environmentalist,” and committed the U.S. to joining a 1 trillion trees initiative launched at the forum.
The initiative encourages countries to collectively plant 1 trillion trees to absorb carbon dioxide in order to combat climate change.
Trump did not mention climate change in his remarks, instead speaking generally about the importance of better managing trees and forests.
"We're committed to conserving the majesty of God’s creation and the natural beauty of our world," Trump said, adding that the U.S. "will continue to show strong leadership in restoring, growing, and better managing our trees and our forests."

GRETA THUNBERG SAYS ‘PLANTING TREES NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH’: The teenage climate activist delivered a different message at the World Economic Forum Tuesday.
She suggested planting trees is insufficient relative to imposing policies that mitigate emissions.
“We are not telling you to keep talking about reaching ‘net zero emissions’ or ‘carbon neutrality’ by cheating and fiddling around with numbers,” Thunberg said. “We are not telling you to ‘offset your emissions’ by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate. Planting trees is good, of course, but it’s nowhere near enough of what is needed and it cannot replace real mitigation and rewilding nature.”
Thunberg said it’s foolish for governments and companies to bank on the development of so-called negative emissions technologies such as carbon capture to reach net-zero emissions.
“Our emissions have to stop if we are to have a chance to stay below the 1.5-degree target,” she said, referencing the high-end goal of the Paris agreement. “And, until we have the technologies that at scale can put our emissions to minus, then we must forget about net zero. We need real zero.”
Thunberg also issued a set of demands for companies, banks, and governments, urging them to “immediately” halt investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, end fossil fuel subsidies, and divest from fossil fuels.
TRUMP’S WATERS RULE FACES SCIENTIFIC SCRUTINY: Before it’s even signed, the Trump administration’s replacement for an Obama-era clean water rule is already battling multiple claims that it contradicts established science.
A group of more than 40 current and former Environmental Protection Agency employees are also accusing political appointees at the agency of silencing career staff experts and scientists, violating the EPA’s scientific integrity policy. They’re asking the EPA’s inspector general to open an inquiry into the final replacement for the Waters of the U.S., or WOTUS, rule, which the Trump administration could unveil as soon as this week.
“It is important to note that this is not merely a difference of scientific opinion between HQ employees and the career employees,” reads the complaint, filed over the weekend by Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility. “This is the difference between established science, and excluding and manipulating that established science.”
This isn’t the first group to call the science into question: The EPA’s own science advisers, many of them appointed in this administration, have also said the Trump EPA proposed changes to which waters qualify for federal protection “without a fully supportable scientific basis.”
The Trump administration’s rule would sharply limit the types of waters considered “navigable waters,” and thus qualifying for federal pollution protections. Trump, in a speech over the weekend, touted his rollback of the WOTUS rule, saying the Obama-era rule gave the government “virtually unlimited authority.”
WHY CHINA’S COAL PROBLEM IS ALSO A US PROBLEM: China’s coal consumption doesn’t appear to be slowing down any time soon. The U.S. has the political and economic power to help change that, but politics are getting in the way.
Why that’s bad for climate change: Almost half of the world’s coal is used in China, so what the country does on coal drives the global market for the high-emitting fossil fuel.
It’s “completely wrong” to say the world is seeing the end of coal, Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, told Abby. While coal is falling quickly in the U.S. and the European Union, though, it’s tough to expect the same sort of rapid changes in Asia, he added.
What the U.S. could do: Put economic and political pressure on China, as well as offer assistance by bringing down the costs of carbon-cutting tech.
Under the Trump administration, though, the U.S. is doing very little. Trump has pulled away from international climate talks. His trade war with China has undercut the countries’ cooperation on carbon capture and other low-carbon technologies. And domestic efforts in the U.S. to deploy carbon capture at a lower cost aren’t moving fast enough.
Read about the state of play in Abby’s latest piece for the Washington Examiner magazine.
STARBUCKS’ NEW CLIMATE PLEDGE: The coffee powerhouse aims for a 50% cut in its carbon emissions from direct operations — the energy it uses itself — and its entire supply chain by 2030.
“We agree with the consensus of scientific experts who note that without drastic action from everyone — governments, companies and all of us as individuals — adapting to the impact of climate change in the future will be far more difficult and costly, taking a toll on our supply chains, our business, and more importantly, the lives of everyone involved,” said Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson in a message posted on the company website.
Starbucks’ commitment announced Tuesday lacks the detail of similar pledges made by other mega companies, such as Microsoft, which pledged last week to be “carbon negative” by 2030, and remove all the carbon it’s ever emitted by 2050.
Johnson said Starbucks aspires to be “resource positive,” storing more carbon that it emits. He did not say, though, if the company plans to invest in negative emissions technologies to help make that a reality. Microsoft is a step ahead, with plans to create a $1 billion fund for new carbon reduction and carbon removal technologies.
BRACEWELL ADDS ENERGY TAX CHOPS: Tim Urban will join the law firm’s Policy Resolution Group after more than two decades at Ernst and Young’s tax lobbying practice in Washington, the firm announced Tuesday.
Urban focuses on energy tax issues such as renewable energy tax credits and carbon tax proposals. Just last year, he lobbied for Duke Energy, Growth Energy, Valero, and the National Biodiesel Board, according to Senate lobbying records.

Texto completo: Ya Irán había reconocido el 11 de enero que el avión de Ukraine International había sido derribado por “error” tras ser confundido con un “blanco hostil”. Pero este martes la Organización de Aviación Civil de la República Islámica dio más detalles sobre lo ocurrido.
Según su segundo informe preliminar, el aparato, un Boeing 737-800, fue alcanzado por dos misiles —y no uno, como expuso en un primer documento— el 8 de enero. Acababa de despegar y todas las 176 personas que iban a bordo murieron, la mayoría ciudadanos iraníes y canadienses.
Ocurrió poco después de que el general Qasem Soleimani , quien comandaba la Fuerza Quds y era considerado el segundo hombre más importante de Irán, muriera en un bombardeo de Estados Unidos en Irak.
* Cómo un avión derribado tras 7 minutos de vuelo reavivó la mayor crisis que vive Irán desde la Revolución Islámica
* Por qué la muerte de Qasem Soleimani es más importante que la de Osama bin Laden
Durante los primeros tres días que siguieron al accidente, Irán negó que las fuerzas armadas tuvieran alguna relación con la caída del Boeing 737-800, a la vez que sugirieron que se había tratado de una falla mecánica.
Pero tras la evidencia presentada por entidades internacionales, la Guardia Revolucionaria afirmó que un operador del sistema de defensa de misiles había confundido el avión con un misil estadounidense y había intentado derribarlo.
Este martes se añadió a esa información que los que impactaron contra el vuelo PS752 de Ukraine International Airlines eran dos proyectiles lanzados por el sistema de misiles Tor-M1 , también conocido como sistema de misiles Tor.
BBC
Según el informe de Aviación Civil, los proyectiles impactaron contra la nave con destino a Kiev, Ucrania, que acababa de despegar de la capital iraní, Teherán, a las 06:12. Tres minutos más tarde, el avión desapareció de los radares de vigilancia secundaria, y en tres minutos más ya no se veía en ningún radar.
Tras los impactos, el avión perdió altura hasta estrellarse contra el suelo, deslizándose por un campo de fútbol y en tierras de cultivo, quedando completamente destrozado.
Pero ¿cómo es el sistema y los misiles que causaron el derribo del avión?
El Tor-M1 es un sistema de misil superficie-aire, de altitud baja a mediana y de corto alcance.
Una de sus características principales es que sus misiles son capaces de detectar un blanco y atacarlo en apenas unos segundos.
Fueron especialmente diseñados por la Unión Soviética para atacar aviones, helicópteros, misiles crucero, drones y otras armas de precisión que vuelan a baja altura.
* Cómo fue la Operación Mártir Soleimani, el ataque con misiles que lanzó Irán contra bases de Estados Unidos en Irak
La URSS lo llamó GRAU 9K330, pero se popularizó con el nombre que le dio la OTAN, SA-15 Gauntlet.
BBC
El sistema tiene también vehículos de combate que actúan como transporte, lanzadores y radares, y pueden detectar hasta 42 objetivos en movimiento.
Además, pueden disparar misiles contra dos objetivos al mismo tiempo.
Se calcula que el sistema tarda entre cinco y ocho segundos en lanzar los proyectiles desde que detecta el blanco en cuestión.
Dentro del vehículo hay ocho misiles 9M330 o 9M331, almacenados entre los radares. Cada uno pesa 167 kilogramos y miden 3,5 metros. Su alcance es de 1,5 a 12 kilómetros y de entre 10 metros y 6 kilómetros de altura.
Getty ImagesUkraine International Airlines había comprado la “nueva generación” de Boeing 737-800 en 2016. Fue el modelo derribado por los misiles de Irán.
Cada lanzador tiene su propio radar y está operado por cuatro personas, aunque buena parte de su funcionamiento está automatizado.
Su velocidad: unos 3.500 kilómetros por hora .
Según la agencia AFP, Irán los usa desde 2007, cuando Rusia le suministró 29 sistemas Tor-M1, sellando un contrato que habían firmado dos años antes y que ascendió a US$700 millones.
La República Islámica dijo entonces que usaría el Tor para defender infraestructuras cruciales, como sus centrales nucleares.

Texto completo: Can a woman be president of the United States?
Hell, yes.
I’ve covered the men who run the world my whole life. And there have been a lot of screw-ups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off a cliff. There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a pervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution.
So please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and just show how you could wield power like a boss. Ibid: Nancy Pelosi.
When Steve Bannon called Pelosi a “total assassin,” according to the hot new book “A Very Stable Genius,” by Washington Post writers Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, he meant it as the highest compliment. You won’t find Pelosi keening about gender; she’s too busy taking care of business.
Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman. She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism. She lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and because she didn’t emulate her husband’s ethos of campaign till the last dog dies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters. She lost because she and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didn’t listen to Bill Clinton, the world’s leading expert on the white, male, rural vote, when he warned them that there was trouble and offered to help out.
Trump operates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal scream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the country. Women are now a majority of the workforce and whites are heading toward a minority status. Hollywood cannot cling to its benighted — and self-defeating — desire to stay a white male club forever, despite the fact that women have always made up half the audience.
Trump’s ascent does not make it harder for women to ascend — just the opposite. Look at the throng of women who were outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018.
Once a woman electrifies Democrats the way JFK, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did — and the way Trump does his base — she will win.
Trump is once more doing his part to energize women voters. On Friday, we learned that the president will get help from Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate.
The Starr chamber was a shameful period of U.S. history, with the prissy Puritan independent counsel hounding and virtually jailing Monica Lewinsky and producing hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad erotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains and genitalia. Like the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale and other Pharisaic Holy Rollers before him, the prosecutor who read the Bible and sang hymns when he jogged became fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way.
Even Trump was appalled. “Starr’s a freak,” the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. “I bet he’s got something in his closet.” In other interviews, he called Starr “a lunatic,” “a disaster” and “off his rocker,” and expressed sympathy for Hillary having to stand by her man when he was “being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko.”
Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clinton’s sexual high jinks, is now going to bat for President “Access Hollywood.” After playing an avenging Javert about foreplay in the Oval, Starr will now do his utmost to prove that a real abuse of power undermining Congress and American foreign policy is piffle.
In 2007, he defended Jeffrey Epstein. By 2016, Starr was being ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women and looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes convicted of sexual assaults. In other words, he’s a complete partisan hack who doesn’t give a damn about sexual assault.
And then there’s Dershowitz, whose past clients have included such sterling fellows as Epstein, Claus von Bülow, O.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein. How did he miss Ted Bundy? Still, Dershowitz has put himself on the side of an impressive pantheon of villainy in the realm of violence against girls and women.
Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew’s accuser, has also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex — a contention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit.
On Fox News, Dershowitz has made the case that it is Pelosi who put herself above the law by delaying the delivery of the articles of impeachment. Good luck with that one.
The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, a few days ago deemed that Trump’s slimy Ukraine gambit violated a law. Yet Dershowitz will somehow argue that it doesn’t represent high crimes and misdemeanors.
He tweeted that he’s nonpartisan because he opposed Bill’s impeachment and voted for Hillary, even as he joined up with Bill’s persecutor. Dershowitz said that he is participating “to defend the integrity of the Constitution.”
That assertion may fly in Foxworld. But in the real world, it’s ridiculous. You can bet that Trump and his buddies will continue to turn out the women’s vote.

Texto completo: Jimmy Heath
NEW YORK - Jimmy Heath, a Grammy-nominated jazz saxophonist and composer who performed with such greats as Miles Davis and John Coltrane before forming the popular family group the Heath Brothers in middle age, has died. He was 93.
Heath's grandson Fa Mtume told The New York Times that he died Sunday at his home in Loganville, Ga. The cause of death was not immediately given.
Heath, a native of Philadelphia, had been playing jazz since the 1940s, in the early days of bebop. He was mentored by Dizzy Gillespie, idolized Charlie Parker, whose nickname was "Bird," and would become known as "Little Bird" for how well he emulated Parker's fluid style.
Heath overcame his battles with heroin addiction, which landed him in prison in the mid-1950s, and had a long and productive career.

Texto completo: The proposed legislation was never meant to be taken seriously, said John Rodgers, a Vermont state senator and fierce gun rights advocate.
“In light of the dangerous and life-threatening consequences of cellphone use by young people, it is clear that persons under 21 years of age are not developmentally mature enough to safely possess them,” Rodgers wrote in a bill this month proposing to outlaw the use of cellphones by anyone under 21.
It was in part, he said, a rebuke of a law Vermont passed in 2018 that banned the sale of firearms to most people under 21 and an attempt to show the absurdity of allowing 18-year-olds to go to war but forbidding them from enjoying the constitutional rights and vices afforded to older Americans.
Rodgers, who said his family had been hunting the woods of the Northeast Kingdom since the 1800s, was quickly bombarded with angry tweets, emails and calls to his home that accused him of trying to create a nanny state. His critics missed the point, he said.
“There are all these pushes around some parts of the country for 16-year-olds to vote, but we’re saying they’re not mature enough to smoke or purchase a gun. So which is it?” said Rodgers. “When are you really an adult?”
When are we truly grown up?
It is a question that has possessed both poets and lawmakers.
But there is not much clarity in state laws. In Alaska, teenagers as young as 14 can get married with a court order. Only a handful of states allow drinking under 21, and that is under strict circumstances, like when a parent or legal guardian is present.
Seeming incongruities
Eighteen-year-old adults can run for office, go to strip clubs, be sentenced to life in prison and volunteer to go to war or be drafted, but as of December, they cannot vape or smoke tobacco products.
And since 1984, when states began raising the legal age of drinking to 21 from 18 in exchange for federal highway funds - in some cases barely a decade after lowering it - they have not been able to buy a beer at a bar in most of the United States, a restriction that has infuriated college students ever since.
“If 18-year-olds are burdened with the responsibility of adulthood, they should be afforded some of its privileges,” said Charlotte Lawson, a 21-year-old fourth-year student at the University of Virginia who wrote an opinion piece in the campus paper in 2018 calling for the drinking age to be lowered from 21.
“It’s interesting these are people who work full-time jobs, pay their own rent, pay taxes and are eligible to vote,” she said. “Yet none of this constitutes adequate proof that a person is responsible enough to drink.”
Why are these laws all over the place? Most laws that govern age restrictions are set by the states.
For much of the 20th century, the minimum age for drinking in the United States dovetailed with the voting age, said Jonathan Parent, a professor of political science at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, New York.
After the end of Prohibition in 1933, most states set the drinking age at 21, which was also the minimum voting age at the time.
Lawmakers reasoned that if you were old enough to vote, you were old enough to drink, Parent said.
That philosophy continued in 1971, when Congress lowered the voting age to 18 in response to fury over the draft during the Vietnam War, which conscripted thousands of men between 18 and 21 into war.
States, in turn, lowered the drinking age to 18, Parent said.
A ‘national problem’
But in 1984, President Ronald Reagan began pushing hard for states to raise their drinking age, citing what he called a “great national problem” of drinking and driving by teenagers.
In July of that year, Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, which required states to raise the age of drinking to 21 or risk a 10% cut in their federal highway funds.
The law put the United States at odds with the rest of the Western world, where in some European countries people as young as 16 can drink wine and beer.
“It’s pretty unique to us,” Parent said. “It probably goes back to more of a Puritan idea in the United States. This is one of the only countries in the Western world that banned alcohol.”
When is an adult
still a child?
It’s a question that Apryl Alexander, a psychology professor at the University of Denver, often gets from her graduate students and has become even more fraught with the growing research around the development of the juvenile brain.
“We don’t have a clear answer for them,” Alexander said. The scientific consensus that most brains do not fully develop until age 25 has led to a host of reforms in the criminal justice system and reexaminations about how society should punish young adults.
But it has also fed the confusion over what young adults should be allowed to do when scientists know that they use less restraint and discipline than older people, said Warren Binford, a law professor at Willamette University and founder of the school’s Child and Family Advocacy Clinic.
“We’re constantly trying to balance the rights to protection and the rights to participation,” Binford said. “We are a society that loves its liberty, but we’re also a society that recognizes that children are unique and special and deserving of protection.”

ANOTHER THING TOM STEYER IS WRONG ABOUT PROPONENTS OF TERM LIMITS ARE EITHER NAIVE OR CYNICAL - SOMETIMES BOTH

Texto completo: The Iowa caucuses are on the horizon and impeachment is in the news, but let's set those aside to talk about something a little less urgent - yet still worthy of scorn: term limits.
A favorite of many would-be reformers, the call to limit legislative tenure is popular with a majority of Americans, who tend to dislike and distrust Congress. The Republican Party included term limits in its 1988 and 1992 national platforms, as well as in its "Contract With America" before the 1994 congressional elections. More recent support comes from President Donald Trump, who endorsed them during his 2016 campaign for president (although he likes to joke about serving past two terms).
Right now, the loudest voice for term limits is Tom Steyer, a billionaire political activist and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has put them at the center of his campaign, part of his plan to reform the government in Washington.
He wants a 12-year total limit for lawmakers: two terms in the Senate, six terms in the House or some combination of the two. Mr. Steyer's website states that "our elected officials are out of touch with our needs and are more focused on getting reelected than actually doing what's right" and that "the longer an elected official stays in office, the more beholden they become to corporate backers and special interest groups."
Mr. Steyer is emphatic on this point. "The American people are demanding term limits!" he tweeted last weekend. "Serving in Congress shouldn't be a lifetime appointment."
This sentiment - born of frustration with corruption, gridlock and polarization - is understandable. But Mr. Steyer, and the three-quarters of Americans who support term limits, are mistaken. Far from fixing Congress, term limits would undermine its power and supercharge the worst problems in Washington.
It's worth saying, to start, that the "problem" of long-serving lawmakers - the problem a term limit purports to solve - isn't actually a problem at all. Congressional scholar Josh Huder notes that just 35 senators (and less than a third of the House) have served 10 years or more. Likewise, according to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service, average tenure in the past two Congresses sat at roughly 10 years. Long-serving lawmakers are highly visible - often because they occupy key leadership roles - but they aren't particularly common.
Not that this would be a problem, even if it were true. Time in office doesn't inexorably lead to poor performance - just the reverse. It's no coincidence that some of the most effective lawmakers in American history - architects of epochal bills like the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act - served for decades, accumulating political and legislative expertise. And if voters want to reward an effective legislator or representative with more time in office, they should have that right. Forced retirement cuts against the idea that voters have an absolute right to choose their representatives.
If the goal of term limits is to bring new faces and fresh ideas to Washington, then the solution isn't a blanket restriction on all lawmakers. The solution is more competition, to make it easier for interested people to run for office and win. There are ways to make that happen. Nonpartisan redistricting in all 50 states would break partisan gerrymandering and force incumbents to compete for votes. Public financing of campaigns would give challengers a fighting chance in a general election. And if part of the problem is low turnout, you can lower the barrier to voting and increase participation through universal registration and mail-in balloting.
In addition to making career politicians extinct, term limits are also supposed to limit corruption, gridlock and polarization. Limit the tenure of office, goes the argument, and lawmakers will be on a deadline to get something done. End the unceasing pressure of re-election, and there's no incentive to raise money from wealthy interests. Mandate turnover, and there's no chance to build entrenched power.
None of that is true. Several states, including Mr. Steyer's own, California, have strict term limits for lawmakers. We can see how they play out. And the results aren't good. In term-limited states, constant turnover leaves legislatures with little expertise. Power is distributed away from the statehouse and to other institutional actors, from governors - who are also term-limited, but use state bureaucracies and party machinery to work their will - to large interest groups and lobbyists.
That last point is critical. Lawmaking is difficult, and expertise has to come from somewhere. In the absence of experienced legislators, that expertise comes from interested actors, people who know something because they need something. States with term limits produce representatives who have to rely on industry interests for knowledge, expertise and institutional memory. Instead of inhibiting corporate influence, term limits sometimes lead to tighter relationships between lawmakers and outside interests.
A term-limited Congress, in all likelihood, is a weak Congress, where inexperienced members are bullied by the White House and even more dependent on lobbyists, where there's little capacity to devise legislation and less interest in long-term problem solving. It's easy to understand why anti-government conservatives would want to limit time in office - they don't want experienced lawmakers. As a first-time candidate for office running for the presidency, Mr. Steyer may not appreciate the benefits of political experience. But as an ostensible progressive, he should also understand the importance of a strong, capable legislature.

Supreme Court's wise decision

Texto completo: Citizens United is 10 years old today. Our subsequent politics has confirmed the wisdom of the decision. It is important to recall the precise issue in Citizens United, because the holding of case is still not well understood. Citizens United was a non-profit corporation that wanted to show a movie opposing Hillary Clinton during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. But an act of Congress called McCain-Feingold prevented it from advocating for or against candidates within 60 days of an election.
The Supreme Court invalidated this restriction. It noted that corporations enjoyed First Amendment rights even in non-political contexts and political speech was even more worthy of protection. Moreover, the First Amendment is a prohibition on Congress. It does not distinguish among the mechanisms or forms by which people may amplify their speech.
Citizens United did not give individuals the right to spend unlimited amounts of money advocating their own or others' election. That right has long been protected. Instead, it allowed citizens to band together to make their voices heard, helping people, like those who created the anti-Hillary film, who are not billionaires.
Time has shown that one concern raised about Citizens United - that large for-profit companies like Exxon would spend lots of money to help get their chosen candidates elected - was baseless. Such companies fear backlash from a customer base that is politically divided. Instead, the messaging enabled by Citizens United has come largely from non-profits and political action committees - so called PACs.
The rising importance of self-funded candidates, like Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, and of other rich individuals shouting out for their own favored candidates also underscore the fundamental fairness of the decision. Why should high-net-worth individuals be able to spend money advocating their own or others' candidacy, while less wealthy citizens are deprived of the means to collectively engage in similar electioneering? That distinction hardly seems like a blow for equality.
And the election of Donald Trump, who spent comparatively little of his own money, reminds us of the electoral power of celebrity. The more anonymous among us should be able to get our political messages out as well over the din of a celebrity-obsessed culture.
Even at the time of Citizens United, it was anomalous to permit media corporations from editorializing about elections while depriving those who are not in the media from using the corporate form to make their own opinions known. It is not as if the media can be counted on to be representative of the American people: It leans distinctly left.
Even at the time the case was decided, the media often reflects the power of particular rich families. The New York Times was controlled by the Sulzbergers, the Wall Street Journal by the Murdochs. But with journalism's recent travails, it is increasingly the case that ownership has passed to the richest among us. Jeff Bezos has taken over the Washington Post and the Laurene Powell Jobs, the Atlantic.
Permitting only media corporations to speak would also require the government to decide what constitutes journalism. That looks perilously like the licensing regime that the First Amendment and its English predecessors were supposed to dismantle.
The recent attempts by foreign nations to influence our political outcomes provides yet another reason to allow our own citizens to spend more money to engage in their own debates. To be sure, we should try to end such foreign influence, including by requiring stricter disclosure, which nothing in Citizens United prevents. But the more powerful our domestic voices are, the less influence foreign governments who wish us ill will have.
The most important reasons to celebrate Citizens United are the most enduring ones. The First Amendment provides a guarantee of freedom, not equality. Free speech rights naturally lead to unequal influence because in any society people have differences in ability, celebrity, position and even inclination to speak out. Yet Citizens United allows ordinary citizens to aggregate their constitutional rights in effective form, providing a more robust debate at election time than would be had its absence.

Texto completo: LAWRENCE, Mass. - Dionisia Ramos gets on the 37 bus twice a day, rooting through her handbag to dig out the fare and drop it into the slot, so it came as shock several months ago when the bus driver reached out his hand to stop her.
"You don't have to pay," he said. "It's free for the next two years."
Ramos had never heard of anything like this: Someone was paying her bus fare? At 55, she lives on a monthly unemployment check for $235. So saving $2.40 a day, for her trip to and from community college, past the hulking mills of Lawrence's industrial past - that meant something.
Since a pilot program began in September, use of the buses has grown by 24%, and the only criticism Ramos has of the city's experiment with fare-free transit is that it is not permanent.
"Transportation should be free," she said. "It's a basic need. It's not a luxury."
That argument is bubbling up in lots of places these days, as city officials cast about for big ideas to combat inequality and reduce carbon emissions. Some among them cast transportation as a pure public good, more like policing and less like toll roads.
The City Council in Worcester, Massachusetts' second-largest city, has expressed support for waiving fares for its buses, a move that would cost $2 million to $3 million a year in lost fares. And fare-free transit is the splashiest policy recommendation of Michelle Wu, a Boston City Council member who is expected by many to run for mayor in 2021.
Larger experiments are underway in other parts of the country. The cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Olympia, Washington, both declared that their buses would become fare-free this year.
The argument against fare-free transit is a simple one: Who is going to pay for it?
In communities where ridership has been falling, the cost of waiving fares may be less than expected.
Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence, intrigued after hearing his friend Wu speak about fare-free transit, asked his regional transit authority how much was collected on three of the city's most-used bus lines. The answer was such a small amount - $225,000 - that he could offset it from the city's surplus cash reserves.
"What I like is the doability of this, the simplicity of it," Rivera said. "We are already subsidizing this mode of transportation, so the final mile is very short. It isn't a service people need to pay for; it's a public good."
Around 100 cities in the world offer free public transit, the vast majority of them in Europe.
A handful of experiments in the United States in recent decades, including in the cities of Denver and Austin, Texas, were viewed as unsuccessful because there was little evidence that they removed cars from the road.
But in another sense, they were successful: They increased ridership right away, with rises from 20% to 60% in the first few months. That statistic accounts for its revival among a new wave of urban progressives.
"Think about who is using our buses: It's black people, folks who live in communities where there are deep, deep concentrations of poverty," said Kim Janey, who was sworn in recently as the president of Boston's City Council and has proposed waiving fares on a key route through some of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
In Boston, the idea has also run into resistance from officials who say the cost would be exorbitant.
Brian Kane, deputy director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which oversees expenditures on Boston's public transit system, said bus fares in Boston brought in $109 million in 2019 and $117 million in 2018.
"Someone has to pay," Kane said. "Boston has the highest-paid bus drivers in the country. They're not going to work for free. The fuelers, the mechanics - they're not going to work for free."

Buttigieg, Trump and white privilege

Texto completo: Most black men rarely get to experience, even vicariously, what it's like to be a white man in this country.
I've been alive awhile now, but only truly understood the white-male mindset once. It was 2006; Matt Lauer, the former NBC Today show host, was prepping for a television interview. He was bent over a coffee table, deep in concentration, reading a stack of papers as people around him set the lighting and sound. In an image that I would later watch on TMZ, the camera pushed in tight on his face. At one point, co-host Meredith Vieira walked over to collect her things from the table. She bent over Mr. Lauer and, as she did, he looked down her sweater as the camera focused straight on his face. "Nice sweater," he said. "Keep bending over like that, it's a nice view."
That one brief moment was like a peek behind a curtain for me. It captured all the privilege and entitlement of what it must be like to be a white man in this country, in one instantaneous and sad moment. I thought to myself: "Ahh, so that's what it's like." Being born white and male in the U.S., compared to any other condition, state or circumstance, is like being wrapped in a blanket of privilege and limitless possibility. You can live where you want, send your kids to any school, and you get paid more money for the same work other people do for less.
I was standing in a line at Starbucks recently and watched as the man behind me picked up a bag of cookies, opened them and starting eating them right there - before he actually paid for them. That's a white man move. I've read Hillbilly Elegy, about the life of a family with Appalachian roots.
The fact that the book was such a revelation and a shock to everyone helps prove my point. Ask any person of color who has read the book what they think about it. White opportunity is not the same as black opportunity.
I see white privilege playing out in the presidential election too. It is no surprise that someone like Pete Buttigieg would think he was qualified to be president. Only a white man would think that someone in his mid-thirties, with no experience running anything of any great consequence, no federal government experience, and a thin, marginal record in the military would be qualified to be president. Only white men think this way.
Women and people of color would not dream of running for the presidency on such a thin list of accomplishments. In fact, history has shown that when they do run, they are often overqualified for the job. Elizabeth Warren is a former senior adviser to a president who oversaw the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and is a sitting U.S. senator. Julian Castro, who has since dropped out, was a federal cabinet secretary and a former big-city mayor. Kamala Harris was the California state attorney general and now serves in the U.S. Senate.
President Donald Trump is the walking embodiment of entitled, political privilege. He was fully aware of his moral and professional deficiencies when he ran and ran anyway. Imagine a black man, or even a white woman, running for president after being accused of grabbing people by the genitals, having endured a slew of bankruptcies and running a campaign built on bold-faced lies and hate speech.
It's not just white males who feed this narrative. We all do. Whenever we elect a president who is not qualified for the job, we feed the narrative. The New York Times just published a comment from a fellow small-town mayor colleague of Mr. Buttigieg. "It is a little bizarre," said Mayor Craig Thurmond of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. "Politics so often is about 'Can you win?' not 'Are you qualified?' I do think he has a chance to win. But being the mayor doesn't qualify you to do that job."
Mayor Thurmond makes a good point. What is it with Americans? Why do we, over and over, elect people who are not qualified to be president and then complain about it afterward? Take a moment and ask yourself, if you had to hire someone to manage your checkbook, educate your children and to watch your back while you slept at night, wouldn't you want a person with a resume that demonstrates that they can actually do these things? When will we ever learn? Three year's into Trump's Administration. I ask you all: Hhow are things working out so far?

Meet Bryan Buckley, the director behind more than 50 Super Bowl commercials

Resumen: Bryan Buckley has directed some of the most iconic Super Bowl ads of the past 20 years and is back for this year's game with two more spots.

Texto completo: Bryan Buckley's first Super Bowl commercial aired more than two decades ago. It was a 30-second spot for Monster. com, shot in black and white, with children speaking directly into the camera about their comically bleak career goals.
"I want to claw my way up to middle management," one says in the 1999 ad.
"I want to be forced into early retirement!" says another.
Buckley thought it would be a hit. And eventually, it came to be considered one. But the initial reactions — including in USA TODAY's Ad Meter, a ranking of Super Bowl ads by consumer rating — were tepid, Buckley recalled. And his client "was freaking out. "
"Because it's the Super Bowl," Buckley said, "the stakes are so, so high. "
Become a panelist: Sign up to vote on all the Super Bowl ads!
Few directors understand those stakes like Buckley, a 56-year-old Massachusetts native who has directed more than 50 Super Bowl commercials over the past two decades. He's directed multiple Super Bowl ads in 16 of the past 20 years. And he's been behind the scenes of several memorable Super Bowl commercials, from E-Trade's brilliant waste of $2 million to an inspiring Microsoft commercial last year.
"I just feel very fortunate to be in this position, to do work that’s going to be exposed at such a large level," Buckley said in a telephone interview. "You realize that we’re creating pieces of pop culture here, that go out there and can influence things in many different ways. I’m very conscious of that. "
Buckley is directing two Super Bowl ads this year: A Boston-themed Hyundai commercial featuring Rachel Dratch, Chris Evans, John Krasinski and David Ortiz, and a 30-second spot for SodaStream.
But he's also evolved beyond commercials. His short film "Saria," which tells the stories of two young female orphans in Guatemala, was recently nominated for an Academy Award. His 2012 short film "Asad," in which the entire cast consisted of Somali refugees with no prior acting experience, also received an Oscar nomination.
AD METER: The funniest Super Bowl commercials of all time
Buckley believes all of his work "ties together," whether it's a comedic 30-second spot for CareerBuilder or an emotional 23-minute opus. It's all storytelling. So he's not one to get caught up in labels.
"If you want to call me a commercial guy, it’s OK. At some point, maybe they’ll call me a feature director," Buckley said. "At one point, they called me an ad guy. "
That was "ancient history," he notes — in the late 1980s.
Buckley, who never went to film school, graduated from Syracuse with a degree in advertising design and opened up his own ad agency with fellow 20-something Tom DeCerchio shortly thereafter. They went against the grain but had immediate success, earning accolades from industry magazines and feature stories in The New York Times. But they hated it. So both Buckley and DeCerchio moved to Los Angeles to become screenwriters.
"We sold a screenplay to Columbia Pictures and we thought, 'Oh, this is easy! Hollywood!'" Buckley said.
That thinking proved to be naive. Instead, Buckley ultimately found steady work co-directing some commercials for a then-burgeoning sports channel called ESPN. He co-directed an estimated 30 to 40 editions of the now-famous "This Is SportsCenter" campaign and about 180 hockey-related spots. He called it "film school on ice, basically. "
"I didn’t call myself a director for the first year, year and half, because I was embarrassed," Buckley said. "I didn’t really believe it. A guy shows up on set and tells hockey players what to do? (That) didn’t seem like a director to me. "
Buckley eventually warmed to the title, though, and after the Monster. com ad in 1999, his Super Bowl seasons grew increasingly busy. He directed three commercials apiece in 2002 and 2003, and four in 2005 and 2006. In 2011, he directed six ads for six different companies.
Buckley said the beginnings of each commercial, and his influence within it, can vary. Some companies or ad agencies give the director an airtight script and little room for change, he said. Others have a general idea and trust the director to make it work. Decisions on casting, location, script and final edits can all fall within Buckley's purview — in addition to, of course, the actual filming and framing of the ad.
With 30-second advertising slots during the Super Bowl broadcast now selling for between $5 million and $5. 6 million, the pressure to get it right is immense. And Buckley said it's becoming increasingly difficult for an ad to resonate.
"If you’re not top-five, then you’re not talked about. That’s it. It’s over, in my mind," he said. "And how do you get to top five? How do you get there? It’s not easy. And really, there’s no set formula. "
Though 30-second Super Bowl commercials might not carry the same prestige as Academy Award nominations, Buckley takes them just as seriously — and has found them to be just as meaningful. He mentioned last year's Microsoft commercial, which finished third in USA TODAY's Ad Meter rankings, as one example. The ad shows a 9-year-old boy named Owen, who has a rare physical condition called Escobar syndrome, playing video games.
It's an ad for the Xbox adaptive controller, but almost a mini-documentary, too. And Buckley said it was one of the most satisfying projects of his career.
"A great kid who has a difficult physical disability suddenly launched onto a national (platform) — it was beautiful," he said. "You can’t make up that moment. "

Texto completo: Our series “How I became a …” digs into the stories of accomplished and influential people, finding out how they got to where they are in their careers.
From her beginnings working in the restaurant scene to becoming a cook with viral recipes like #TheCookies and #TheStew, Alison Roman is quite the culinary jill-of-all-trades. As the bestselling author of cookbooks “Dining In” and “Nothing Fancy” as well as a columnist for New York Times Cooking and Bon Appétit, Roman always has her hands on a keyboard or working on a stovetop.
USA TODAY caught up with the food writer and chef extraordinaire to talk about everything from Joan Didion and oat milk to learning to say no and consistently cultivating staying power in everything she does.
Question: How did you get your start?
Alison Roman: I started by working in kitchens, working in restaurants as a pastry cook. That looks very different than my life does now, but I was working in restaurants and doing service and coming up with dishes that went on menus, things like that.
It basically all relates to each other. I don’t think that I would have been as strong of a writer about food had I not cooked professionally and had that background experience. It also teaches you a ridiculous work ethic that is challenging to find elsewhere.
Q: What does a typical day look like for you?
Roman: A typical day is super atypical. It really depends – if I’m shooting photos or videos or shopping for those things, or I’m doing neither and I’m writing or traveling or running errands and trying to stay on top of my general life administration. I feel like I do so many different things all the time that there truly is no typical day, which makes things very challenging.
Q: What’s your favorite part about your job?
Roman: It’s different all the time; it pushes me creatively and intellectually, and I get to have contact with people and teach them things and have an impact on their lives. It’s a completely unique experience to be in people’s homes and be a part of their lives, even if it feels one-sided because I don’t actually know them. But, just to have a lasting impact that feels a bit different than, say, cooking for them in a restaurant (which can obviously have a really deep impact, but it’s just a different style).
Q: To what do you credit your success?
Roman: Really hard work, and not letting things that I find challenging deter me. I think that I have come up against a lot of things that I struggled with, but I’ve never thought that meant I shouldn’t be doing what I wanted to be doing.
Q: How do you balance work, life, and such a busy schedule?
Roman: That’s a great question, and an answer I don’t actually have. That’s something I’m working on. I think that as I get more secure in my career and more successful, it’s much easier for me to kind of say no to things and to make time for myself, my friends, and protect my space and personal life. I find that to be easier and easier, and I think I’m getting there. But, just understanding that I’m not going to be very good at my job or to anyone else if I am feeling run ragged because I haven’t set aside any time for myself.
Q: What have been some career highlights?
Roman: I’ll never forget the first time I was published in Bon Appetit, I’ll never forget the first time I got a job as a pastry chef, I’ll never forget being recognized for the things that I was putting on menus in restaurants, I’ll never forget my first column in The New York Times or making The New York Times bestseller’s list, or these milestones that I feel like only happen once that truly do feel so, so special.
Q: What advice would you give to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Roman: Try different things. Always say yes. Push yourself. Just know that it’s not going to be easy. Nothing just falls into your lap, and if it does it’s not going to last for very long. You have to constantly be thinking about how to make something secure and stable. Things will come your way, and you may achieve a small amount of success by accident, but in order to really keep it and have staying power, you have to actually work at it, and work really hard. It’s like a plant that you have to water and feed and take care of.
Quick hits
• What’s your coffee order? Oat milk cortado, iced black, or a regular black.
• What’s your favorite book? I’m really bad at favorites, but I’m rereading "Slouching Towards Bethlehem" right now, which is so good.
• What’s your favorite song at the moment? I’ve been listening to a lot of King Princess.
• Who have been your biggest mentors? I’ve been really lucky to have many mentors in the various stages of my career, but I have two chefs I worked for – Ron Mendoza and William Werner – who really helped shape a lot of my work ethic and basic understanding of pastry, cooking, and baking. As I moved more into editorial, I had a lot of really great champions. Christine Muhlke and Adam Rapoport were both so wonderful at championing me and pursuing my own thing.
• What’s the coolest thing you’ve ever done? My whole life is really cool. I feel very fortunate and happy to have done several cool things. I was actually just thinking that today while we were shooting videos for The New York Times. I find as much joy in that as if I’m recording [a podcast] with NPR or going on a vacation to Mexico. The coolest thing I’ve done is shape my life to be able to do a bunch of cool things.

Texto completo: I don't watch much daytime TV, so I have read more about The View than I have seen, and most of what I've read about The View has involved Meghan McCain, daughter of the late senator.
Last week, the New York Times published an article under the headline "'The View' Has a Meghan McCain Problem."
No.
Actually, "The View" and the rest of America has a Meghan McCain blessing.
Don't get me wrong.
McCain can be a pain in the you-know-what. And she's wildly wrong about plenty of issues. Sort of like her beloved father, whom I followed in Arizona from the time he was first elected to Congress.
But what Meghan McCain demonstrates, just as her father demonstrated, is that a person with her views can be dead wrong, even borderline wacky, but still have integrity and honesty and knowledge and, in an old-fashioned sense, honor.
She's a Republican, and some of her views might be ultra conservative, but she is not willing to sell her soul to a person like Donald Trump.
According to the Times:
It has become the norm to watch Ms. McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain, square off against her co-hosts in a barrage of vehement exchanges.
There is nothing wrong with vehement exchanges that are honestly rendered. That's how it used to be before Trump, whose vehement exchanges are dishonestly rendered.
The Times continued:
For some viewers, Ms. McCain is the privileged product of conservative nepotism, capitalism and the American military-industrial complex. That coalescence naturally renders her a villain to progressives, who envision her as the cathartic personification of a punching bag on social media. Conversely, each pile-on reinforces her self-written narrative of the long-suffering victim of censorship.
Actually, what the "pile-on" reinforces is that McCain isn't looking for a safe place to express herself.
It's the difference between a preacher who sticks to the pulpit and one who goes out among the non-believers.
For example, Fox News hosts stick to the pulpits and consider any criticism of Trump to be blasphemy, not because they actually believe it but because they fear the congregation as much as the president.
In that sense, Meghan McCain is taking on both her co-hosts on "The View" and, indirectly, the Fox News preachers and their acolytes.
Unlike so many other conservatives, including Sen. Martha McSally, who was appointed to her father's seat, McCain is unwilling to sell her soul to Trump in order to get judges whom conservatives might like, or corporate tax cuts, or weakened environmental regulations, or cutbacks to federal safety net programs.
And she's doing so on national TV.
She's not alone. There are a lot of Republican conservatives like her, but most don't have her high-profile platform, and many of them – former Sen. Jeff Flake comes to mind – are now called traitors by their own party.
People like Meghan McCain, like her father, can be a pain. But they also prove that not all partisans are zombies, that there are still Americans who actually believe in country over party.
That is a blessing.

Force not for everyone

Texto completo: The assault was swift and sustained: 500 Stormtroopers stood on the Great Wall. X-Wings swooped into Shanghai and Beijing. Lightsabers crackled in theaters across the country.
And millions of moviegoers responded: This again? Who cares?
One after another, "Star Wars" movies have flopped in China, defying efforts to bring one of the most successful franchises in history into a market that has printed money for the heroes, monsters and robots of other films. The latest "Star Wars" movie, "The Rise of Skywalker," has followed the trend by grossing nearly 1 billion dollars worldwide and barely breaking $20 million in China.
The episodes that came before it didn't do much better, for reasons that include history, geopolitics and a distinct lack of the nostalgia that drove viewers in the United States. Thousands of Americans lined up in costumes for each premiere: "The Force Awakens" opened to almost a quarter-billion dollars in the United States in 2015; two years later, "The Last Jedi" made nearly as much; and "The Rise of Skywalker" raked in $177 million in its first few days last month.
In China, those movies opened to $52 million, $28 million and $12 million, respectively.
Chen Tao, who manages China's biggest fan website, Star Wars Fans China, estimated that China's fan clubs have fewer than 200 members in all.
As ticket sales for "The Last Jedi" dwindled in China a few years ago, a college student in Beijing, Xu Meng, told the South China Morning Post that the filmmakers should try new stories, new characters -- and a new name. "If the new 'Star Wars' sequels were not named after 'Star Wars,' it would be better," she said.
Another student, Lang Yifei, called the series "heavy and gloomy," adding: "I think they need to give up on the old stories."
The diminishing returns from the series in China are in spite of Disney's aggressive marketing efforts. The company deployed miniature Stormtroopers and life-size starfighters, and collaborated with Chinese partners on a host of projects, including translated books and a music video by a Chinese Korean boy band.
The campaign underscores how much money is at stake in the Chinese film market, now the second largest in the world. The latest "Avengers" movie grossed more than half a billion dollars there, and series like "Transformers" and "The Fast and the Furious" consistently make hundreds of millions of dollars.
The difference, film historians and industry experts said, is that movies like "Hobbs & Shaw" or "Jurassic World" can mostly stand apart from the stories they followed, and that Chinese audiences have grown up with series like Marvel's comic-book heroes.
But almost no one in China grew up with the original "Star Wars." When the first films were released in the late 1970s and early '80s, China was coming out of the Cultural Revolution, an era in which Western entertainment was suppressed and people with ties to the West were persecuted.
"That basically wiped out the first six films of the franchise," said Michael Berry, a professor of Chinese literature and film at the University of California, Los Angeles. "It didn't have the opportunity to get its hooks in."
With "somewhat abstruse, complicated jargons and plots," said Ying Xiao, a professor of China studies and film at the University of Florida, "it is quite difficult for a Chinese audience who was not raised along with sequels to comprehend, digest and appreciate the attraction."
And while the first three films inspired untold tons of merchandise -- keeping interest alive after the credits rolled -- the movies remained essentially unknown in China, except as picture storybooks that riffed on "Star Wars" images with no relation to the movies.
Parents did not pass action figures, lunchboxes or VHS tapes on to their children. By the time the prequel trilogy was released around the turn of the century, with Chinese theaters opening up, Skywalker was still a foreign word.
"Most people would say that Disney did too little too late, that 'Star Wars' was dead on arrival," said Stanley Rosen, a professor at the University of Southern California who studies Chinese society and cinema. But the company made "semiheroic efforts," he said, to make its latest films work in China, where the market is tightly regulated and watched by censors.
A spokesman for Disney did not respond to a request for comment.
Xiao said that the current trade war hampered both Hollywood and the Chinese film industry, saying nationalistic sentiments made it "more challenging and formidable nowadays for films to break down the walls and to cross the national, cultural boundaries."
China's box office has recently been dominated by homegrown competitors, Xiao noted. Those include "Ip Man 4," the latest in a martial arts saga, and "The Wandering Earth," an example of "hard" science fiction that Rosen said is more popular in China than the "science fiction soap opera" of "Star Wars."
And over the past decade, China's film industry has matured across production, directing, marketing and acting, said Marc Ganis, the president of the entertainment company Jiaflix. He noted that "Star Wars" had struggled in other Asian countries with tougher competition at home, like Japan and South Korea.
For the "Star Wars" spinoff "Rogue One," Disney filmmakers cast two stars well-known to Asian audiences -- Donnie Yen and Jiang Wen -- to small effect.
In a 2018 interview, Yen attributed the film's struggles in China to its long back story, which he compared with the relative simplicity -- and success -- of comic-book movies. "Marvel is a lot easier to understand," he said. "'Star Wars,' there's a whole universe out there."
As if to prove his point, "Avengers: Endgame" made more in its 2019 opening weekend in China than all the "Star Wars" premieres combined.
And some selling points of the original trilogy -- like the special effects that awed audiences in the '70s and '80s -- are more charming than revolutionary in the 21st century, said Aynne Kokas, a professor at the University of Virginia and the author of "Hollywood Made in China."
"'Star Wars' in the West is really a kind of generational phenomenon," she said, "the experience of sharing your experience with your kids." She noted that the arc of the series was largely about family and full of callbacks, an evolving mythology and generational transitions.
"What we've seen is a lot of derivative activity, a lot of derivative characters, efforts to recapture the magic of the original trilogy," she said. "That hasn't caught on with audiences" in China.
Kokas said the character known as Baby Yoda, from the series "The Mandalorian," was an example of the franchise trying to recreate its greatest hits. "Yoda is gone, and we're trying to bring the magic of 'Star Wars' into the next generation," she said.

Texto completo: The county of Rutland, England's smallest by some measures, has for years had varied gastronomic options: pub food, Indian cuisine, tapas and even a restaurant with a Michelin star.
But it was the only English county not to have a McDonald's -- until now.
Last week, the local council approved an application by McDonald's for a new restaurant in the county, a decision that many in the area viewed as a surrender of England's last fortress to fast food's signature Golden Arches, despite a promise by the company that the outlet would provide at least 65 jobs.
Among residents' objections to the McDonald's, which is planned near the town of Oakham, were worries over litter, noise, obesity and crime.
Rutland, a rural county with a population of about 37,000, has been noted for its serenity and beauty. It was hailed as "Britain's best rural area for quality of life" by Halifax bank in 2015.
"There are numerous independent food retailers in and around Oakham that provide healthy, good-priced food alternatives," Claire Baines, a Rutland resident, told the council, in one of 80 written responses by the public before the meeting that approved the application.
"Why, in this day and age of spiraling obesity, diabetes and other health issues," she asked, "would you encourage the introduction of a fast-food restaurant serving nothing but junk food?"
Others said they hoped a McDonald's might help modernize the county and reduce unemployment.
"Rutland is a stunning county, but it could do with moving on with the times," Victoria Wallace wrote to the council, and Nicola Tyers wrote that the fast-food outlet would provide "the younger generation in the area with jobs and a place to meet with friends in a safe and friendly environment."
Gordon Brown, the senior local council member responsible for planning, said the planning officers and council members had to be impartial when deciding on any new development, despite any passionate opinions on the matter among members of the public.

Winfrey backs out of documentary

Texto completo: Twenty minutes. That's how long Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering had to digest the news that Oprah Winfrey was pulling her support of their documentary before she released the announcement to the press.
The email from Winfrey, sent at 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 10, had come as a shock. In her message, the filmmakers said, the Harpo Productions head said she would no longer be serving as the executive producer of their still-untitled documentary about the survivors of Russell Simmons' alleged sexual abuse.
Subsequently, the movie -- set to premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival -- was dropped from a planned release on Apple TV+ through Winfrey's deal with the streaming platform.
"In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured, and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision," Winfrey said in her 3:30 p.m. statement, in which she also made it clear she "unequivocally" believes and supports the film's subjects.
"Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission, but given the filmmakers' desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it's best to step aside."
Dick and Ziering, who have collaborated on six nonfiction films, had never been under the impression that Winfrey had serious concerns about the documentary. On the contrary: Ever since they first met with her in New York in January 2019, they said she had been effusive in her praise of the project.
"She loved, loved, loved what we did," recalled Ziering, sitting in her Brentwood home alongside Dick earlier this week.
"And then she saw it numerous times throughout the editing process. We had a very close working relationship and very, very positive -- enthusiastically positive. There weren't any issues."
Winfrey, who did not respond to The Times' request for comment, announced her collaboration with Dick and Ziering -- then called "Toxic Labor" -- at Apple TV's first media presentation in Cupertino, California, on March 25. Apple, which also did not respond to The Times' inquiries, subsequently wrote the application submitting the movie to Sundance in October, the filmmakers said.
It was accepted to the festival, and on Dec. 3 -- a day before the Sundance lineup was released -- Harpo and Apple put out their own announcement touting the collaboration.
"Apple was busy booking us rooms and flights," Ziering said. "There was no intonation of any problems whatsoever."
Online, however, backlash was brewing.
On Dec. 12, the rapper 50 Cent posted a picture of a smiling Winfrey and Simmons together on his Instagram account, accompanied by a caption questioning "why Oprah is going after black men" instead of Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein. He alluded to the fact that Winfrey had also supported two alleged survivors of Michael Jackson's sexual abuse who appeared in the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland." After that film aired in March 2019, Winfrey sat down with the subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, for an interview special. She has since said that never before in her career had one of her interviews sparked such "hateration."
Simmons, meanwhile, voiced his own disappointment with Winfrey on Dec. 13. In a letter addressed to Winfrey, the disgraced former R&B mogul said he found it "troubling" that she had chosen him to "single out" in the project.
The filmmakers were not alarmed by the post: "That's accused predator playbook 2.0," Ziering said.
But a few days later, the directors received a new round of notes from Harpo, and Winfrey suggested the film might not be ready for Sundance. The suggestions they'd received from the production company up to this point, they said, had been "wonderful" and "acute" -- mostly small things such as "we don't like the way this scene transitions" or "can we build out this scene because we want more of this character," Dick explained.
Receiving a new round of notes after picture lock was startling to the filmmakers, but they were not alarmed.
"We felt we could address them," Dick said. "We didn't really feel like the film needed them because the film was already good, but as good partners we wanted to honor the relationship and just keep moving forward. We had to cancel a lot of holiday plans, but we have a great staff and we pushed forward and got it out."
The filmmakers urged Harpo to move ahead with the Sundance release, arguing that it could be traumatizing for the alleged survivors featured in the documentary to change the distribution path once it had already been announced. And more changes could be made to the film post-Sundance -- a common scenario for movies that debut at the annual January festival.
"Much as we wanted (Winfrey) to be happy and keep up the amazing relationship we had -- and as much as we really do totally respect her vision -- we felt and argued that we couldn't blink," Ziering recalled. "People would say that there's a problem. If she didn't want to go to Sundance or there was a change of heart about the distribution plan, the time for that had passed."
When Winfrey's Jan. 10 statement went wide, the filmmakers immediately reached out to the women in the movie -- Simmons' accusers, including Drew Dixon, Sil Lai Abrams and Alexia Norton Jones -- to check in.
"I felt horrible that we didn't have more advance time to set them up and warn them," Ziering said, her eyes filling with tears. "That's a shock wave. It was horrible. It's been horrible."
The Simmons documentary is the fourth that Ziering and Dick have tackled on the subject of sexual abuse. They have explored the issue in the church ("Twist of Faith"), on college campuses ("The Hunting Ground") and in the military ("The Invisible War," nominated for best documentary at the 2013 Oscars).
For years they had wanted to delve into sexual harassment in Hollywood and had spoken with Weinstein's alleged survivors prior to fall 2017, when claims of his predatory behavior first surfaced in the New York Times. (The Weinstein Co.'s RADiUS-TWC division had released "The Hunting Ground.")
"We had gone to several distributors and did not get funding, not surprisingly," Dick said of the pair's pre-#MeToo movement efforts.
But as soon as an avalanche of serious accusations involving powerful entertainment industry figures began to pour out in late 2017, the filmmakers were able to secure financing from Impact Partners -- the company behind documentaries including Academy Award winners "The Cove" and "Icarus."
At first, Dick and Ziering cast a wide net -- reaching out to victims, executives and even this reporter about appearing in the film. Through a mutual filmmaker friend, they were connected with Drew Dixon, who told them that Simmons had raped her in his Manhattan apartment while she was working as a 24-year-old executive assistant at Def Jam Recordings in 1995.
At the time, the Los Angeles Times had yet to publish the first public accusations against Simmons. That came on Nov. 19, 2017, when Keri Claussen Khalighi told the paper that in 1991, when she was a 17-year-old model, Simmons had forced her to perform oral sex on him and then penetrated her from behind while she was showering.
Since then, an additional 19 women -- including Dixon, who spoke out in a Dec. 13, 2017, New York Times article -- have alleged that Simmons was sexually inappropriate with them. He has vehemently denied all the claims, describing himself as a reformed "womanizer" who has "never been violent or forced myself on anyone."
As Dixon was wrestling with whether or not to speak publicly, the filmmakers were trailing her with cameras.
"We told her, 'No one has ever seen the inside of what it is when someone grapples with that decision,' " said Ziering. "(We said), 'Do you mind if we follow your journey? And no harm, no foul. You can stop us any time. You can tell us to go away. We're survivor-focused, so I don't want you to feel any emotional pressure, and if after six months you tell us you don't want us to use the footage, we're totally fine.'
"And I meant that. I always say that to anybody we talk to."
Ultimately, they decided to focus their first MeToo project -- they have several more in the pipeline -- on Dixon and the plight of African-American women who decide to speak out about sexual abuse.
"No one wants to compare the parade of horribles, but what we ... find revelatory is the unique bind that women of color find themselves in," Ziering said. "As Drew points out, sexual assault is sort of baked into the DNA of our country. Women of color came to our country as property, and they could be assaulted and they had no recourse to any kind of system of justice. That's their legacy of their trauma.
"So a couple centuries later, here we are, and it hasn't shifted where they feel like the police necessarily take their claims with the same legitimacy that a person society privileges.
"And you have the second hurdle of -- because of our culture's incredible history of racism and because ground zero for many racist tropes is 'a black man is a predator or rapist or some kind of criminal' -- do they really want to come forward and pile onto the burden that all black men feel when they walk down the street in America? And then ... when they do come forward, the black community is very torn and divided because you got to circle the wagons."
Dick and Ziering acknowledged that some of the film's subjects initially had an issue with the fact that two white filmmakers wanted to tell their story.
"I owned it," Ziering said. "I said, 'Well, yeah. Let's talk about it.' "
Some of those conversations -- held on and off camera -- were included in earlier incarnations of the film but were ultimately excluded because the filmmakers did not want to draw focus to themselves.
"But it was a playing out of the very problem that the film was investigating," Ziering said. "Do you go out to the white community and share your burden, and do you trust the white community to take care of your burden with the care, sensitivity and intelligence and empathy and moral rectitude that it deserves?"
Through Time's Up, which is handling press for Simmons' alleged survivors', Dixon and the other women in the film declined to be interviewed for this story. But on her Twitter account, Dixon has insinuated that Winfrey's removal from the project left her feeling disappointed.
In a since-deleted Jan. 10 tweet, she wrote to her followers: "Thank you for your support. With love from under the bus."
As for the filmmakers, they're still licking their wounds. But they're also looking forward to the Jan. 25 Sundance premiere, where they will be seeking a new distribution partner.
"We wish we were going with Apple and Ms. Winfrey," Dick said. "We do, but it's bigger than those two, really. We feel the film is completely solid (and) addresses everything very powerfully. We know that it does because the responses of hundreds of people from all walks of life have been glowing and enthusiastic.
"We stand by the film, we stand by the survivors' stories completely. We know that the veracity is completely locked down. We think the film is strong and we are very hopeful that audiences at Sundance will feel the same."

Texto completo: At 33, Jahleel Weaver has pretty much won the celebrity-stylist lottery.
As deputy creative director of Fenty, the women's ready-to-wear and accessories line introduced by Rihanna in May, his days are spent working alongside a nine-time Grammy Award winner whose clothing brand is backed by LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, and released to her passionate fans without regard to conventional seasonal rhythms.
Theirs is a close relationship. "We talk almost every day," Weaver said. "I feel I'm her little brother," although Rihanna is younger, at 31.
"Creatively, he is my right hand," she wrote of Weaver in an email, "but at the same time, it's as if we're family."
The path that led Weaver to help guide the most talked-about fashion debut of 2019, founded by one of the most influential women in popular culture, was a long and gently winding one.
At 18, he moved from suburban Maryland to New York to study fashion design at LIM College. Weaver helped support himself by working in sales at Jeffrey, the high-end retailer in the meatpacking district known for its extensive shoe department and attentive customer service.
He quickly met some famous clients, many downtowners working in music, and began to style several. "To be working for, and building a brand," Weaver said, "I always think about my experience at Jeffrey."
Weaver was also making inroads working as a freelance stylist away from the store, and it was on one of these gigs that he met Mel Ottenberg, who is currently the creative director of Interview magazine. Ottenberg had just begun collaborating with Rihanna on her 2011 "Loud" tour and brought Weaver on to assist him.
Soon enough, Weaver and Rihanna became inseparable, traveling the globe together. (Ottenberg continues to style Rihanna on occasion, as he did in 2018, dressing her when she was a host of the Met Gala in a dazzling jewel-embroidered, papal-inspired Margiela ensemble.)
When Rihanna decided in 2014 to start the umbrella company Fenty Corp., giving it her last name, she asked Weaver to join as a junior creative director.
He was there to help her create the beauty line Fenty Beauty, which soon had legacy cosmetics brands scurrying to broaden the colors of foundation on offer; Savage x Fenty, a line of inclusive, body-positive-inspired lingerie, the show of which had fashion week attendees squealing in September; and Cameo, her everything-old-is-new-again jewelry line.
"The most valuable thing Jahleel brings to the process," Rihanna said, "is his complete understanding of my vision."
Virgil Abloh, the founder of the cult streetwear-inspired fashion line Off-White and the artistic director for menswear at Louis Vuitton (also part of LVMH), said the creative dynamic between Rihanna and Weaver has resulted in "looks that are cemented within popular culture." (Fuzzy slides were just the beginning.)
Abloh first came to know Weaver through what he refers to as an "international tribe of creatives," a community of designers and artists constantly on the move.
Weaver, although he continues to travel extensively, now lives primarily in Paris. He moved there in early 2018 to begin work on Fenty's debut, a fairly stressful undertaking.
"How do you put everything that Rihanna represents into one collection?" Weaver said.
The answer came to the pair late one night in the form of a music metaphor: an album and its release. Rather than settle on distinct, themed collections shown twice a year, Fenty would drop capsule collections throughout the year, much as singles are released over the course of an album's rollout.
This would heighten anticipation and set the brand apart from the grind of the fashion pack.
"Each release," Weaver said, "can speak to something different," with inspiration taken from various aspects of Rihanna's personal style, be it sleek futurism or the history of Cameo.
"At the end, you have a full album, a full body of work," Weaver said. "I think that's the beauty about our release schedule - there's a piece of Fenty for everything you might need to get dressed."
Basing Fenty's strategy around online drops was a radical move, jolting the old seasonal schedule with the hectic cadence of fast fashion.
But Fenty has been even more cutting edge in giving people of color a place at the top of an industry still plagued by racial inequality and insensitivity.
When Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH announced Fenty, Rihanna became the first woman and person of color to establish a house with the luxury retail giant. At a time when high-profile brands continue to be plagued by racist missteps - just this year Gucci was forced to recall a balaclava knit-top that resembled blackface - the significance of Fenty's debut was not lost on Weaver.
"All the barriers that were broken in that one day, with that one announcement," he said, "I actually cried."
Along with Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Olivier Rousteing running Balmain, Rihanna's entry into the field was further evidence to many that change, however overdue, is finally coming to the upper echelons of luxury fashion.
Weaver is feeling optimistic. "Because of people like Ri constantly breaking barriers," he said, "it makes it a lot easier to exist in space where representation for people of color didn't necessarily exist."
And his own place in that space?
"Honestly," Weaver said, "I think I'm still pinching myself."

Junior-high boys caught up in scrunchie crush craze

Texto completo: Here's the news from winter break: Scrunchies have become a desired item for junior-high schoolboys.
Today's tween girls are offering their scrunchies - the fabric-poofed hair elastics last popular in the 1980s - to their crushes. If accepted, the boy will wear it around his wrist until he finds a new scrunchie - er, crush.
If he really likes the girl, he can offer his hoodie in return.
"Well, now I know why my 13-year-old has a bunch of scrunchies in his room, and why his hoodie is missing," said Amanda Marks, who lives in Decatur, Georgia, and is the co-host and producer of the "Sis & Tell" podcast.
How this trend started is a bit of a mystery, but it appears to have gained traction.
It's possible that the Netflix movie "To All the Boys I've Loved Before" had something to do with it. During the flick, which is based on Jenny Han's young adult book series, the main character snags a scrunchie from his crush's hair and puts it on his wrist, commenting that she looks pretty with her hair down.
Han had no idea it was such an influential scene.
"I had no idea kids were offering up scrunchies to their crushes," she said. "I think it's delightful."
Perhaps adults are unaware of or indifferent to the scrunchie crush craze, but in junior highs and even in some high schools across the country, it appears to be quite a big deal.
The hashtag #Savethescrunchies trended briefly this fall, scrunchie collection funds started by parents of tween girls have started, and undoubtedly any store selling scrunchies is making money off these crushes.
And there are rules, according to Nora Cullerton, a 15-year-old in River Forest, Illinois.
"If a guy is wearing a scrunchie, you know he has a girlfriend," she said. "You can give any color, and the boys will take a Snapchat of the scrunchie and send it to the girl to show them that they're wearing it."
In middle school, Nora said, a girl gives a boy a scrunchie if she likes him. In high school, she gives it to him if they're dating. If the couple is in a nontraditional relationship? Anything could happen.
You may note that the scrunchie-hoodie trade is not an equal one.
After learning of the trend and noticing the scrunchies piling on her son's desk - along with the missing hoodie - Marks told her son that it was ridiculous to give away a hoodie because it's simply not equivalent in monetary value to a scrunchie.
"I mentioned I would totally buy him some scrunchies to give to girls he had crushes on if he wanted me to," Marks said. "Of course he gave me a look that said, 'You're being ridiculous.' "
Mark, 42, said that back in her day they gave each other a mixtape or CD, or even homemade friendship bracelets made out of string.
"I'm guessing sending someone a Spotify playlist just doesn't have the same sentiment?" she said dryly.
Kate Sorensen, the mother of a 12-year-old boy in Ankeny, Iowa, said the scrunchie crush trades are "running rampant" in his sixth grade class. He has arrived home with two so far.
"As for our son giving away a hoodie - he's got plenty to spare, however, I would be really frustrated if he started giving clothes away," Sorensen said.
The two scrunchies he received now live on his desk in his room.
Other tweens are possessive over their scrunchies, given the fact that posh velvet or satin are the styles to get and they can really make a dent in the allowance ($18 for a set of 10 at Urban Outfitters).
Tully Lovell, 10, a fifth grader in River Forest, Illinois, said she hasn't given anyone a scrunchie and doesn't plan on indulging in the fad.
"I like my scrunchies too much," she said.

Cities getting on board with free public transit

Texto completo: LAWRENCE, Mass. - Dionisia Ramos gets on the 37 bus twice a day, rooting through her handbag to dig out the fare and drop it into the slot, so it came as shock several months ago when the bus driver reached out his hand to stop her.
"You don't have to pay," he said. "It's free for the next two years."
Ramos had never heard of anything like this: Someone was paying her bus fare? At 55, she lives on a monthly unemployment check for $235. So saving $2.40 a day, for her trip to and from community college, past the hulking mills of Lawrence's industrial past - that meant something.
Since a pilot program began in September, use of the buses has grown by 24%, and the only criticism Ramos has of the city's experiment with fare-free transit is that it is not permanent.
"Transportation should be free," she said. "It's a basic need. It's not a luxury."
That argument is bubbling up in lots of places these days, as city officials cast about for big ideas to combat inequality and reduce carbon emissions. Some among them cast transportation as a pure public good, more like policing and less like toll roads.
The City Council in Worcester, Massachusetts' second-largest city, has expressed support for waiving fares for its buses, a move that would cost $2 million to $3 million a year in lost fares. And fare-free transit is the splashiest policy recommendation of Michelle Wu, a Boston City Council member who is expected by many to run for mayor in 2021.
Larger experiments are underway in other parts of the country. The cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Olympia, Washington, both declared that their buses would become fare-free this year.
The argument against fare-free transit is a simple one: Who is going to pay for it?
In communities where ridership has been falling, the cost of waiving fares may be less than expected.
Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence, intrigued after hearing his friend Wu speak about fare-free transit, asked his regional transit authority how much was collected on three of the city's most-used bus lines. The answer was such a small amount - $225,000 - that he could offset it from the city's surplus cash reserves.
"What I like is the doability of this, the simplicity of it," Rivera said. "We are already subsidizing this mode of transportation, so the final mile is very short. It isn't a service people need to pay for; it's a public good."
Around 100 cities in the world offer free public transit, the vast majority of them in Europe.
A handful of experiments in the United States in recent decades, including in the cities of Denver and Austin, Texas, were viewed as unsuccessful because there was little evidence that they removed cars from the road.
But in another sense, they were successful: They increased ridership right away, with rises from 20% to 60% in the first few months. That statistic accounts for its revival among a new wave of urban progressives.
"Think about who is using our buses: It's black people, folks who live in communities where there are deep, deep concentrations of poverty," said Kim Janey, who was sworn in recently as the president of Boston's City Council and has proposed waiving fares on a key route through some of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
In Boston, the idea has also run into resistance from officials who say the cost would be exorbitant.
Brian Kane, deputy director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which oversees expenditures on Boston's public transit system, said bus fares in Boston brought in $109 million in 2019 and $117 million in 2018.
"Someone has to pay," Kane said. "Boston has the highest-paid bus drivers in the country. They're not going to work for free. The fuelers, the mechanics - they're not going to work for free."

Junior-high boys caught up in scrunchie crush craze

"I like my scrunchies too much," she said.

Texto completo: Many have been all too quick to make Attorney General William Barr out to be a reflexive toady for President Trump. Just last week, the New York City Bar Association took the extreme step of writing to congressional leaders to investigate Barr for political bias. And last month, he came under blistering criticism for defending the Trump campaign and characterizing the FBI's Russia investigation into the 2016 election as bogus.
Slate has accused Barr of using the Department of Justice as "a personal law firm for Trump." Vox has bewailed "the department's politicization under Barr." The Daily Beast has lamented how Barr has "become another of Donald Trump's personal lawyers." The New York Times has noted that the attorney general had "reprised his role as a vocal defender of President Trump."
Perhaps none of these media outlets recall the time when then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. famously described himself as President Obama's "wingman." Curiously, Holder actually took to the Washington Post to decry Barr's ostensible self-debasement as an unfortunate "instrument of politics."
Holder's hypocrisy aside, the new stance in favor of a strongly independent attorney general among liberals is misguided as a matter of constitutional interpretation and ahistorical as a matter of American custom.
Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution states that "(t)he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." The power is vested not in numerous sources, but solely in the president. The president maintains plenary authority over the entirety of the executive branch.
The "unitary executive theory," which Democrats routinely excoriate, comes from the plain text of the Constitution. As Barr recently said during his remarks at the Federalist Society's 2019 National Lawyers Convention, the notion of the unitary executive "is not 'new,' and it is not a 'theory.'" On the contrary, he continued, "(i)t is a description of what the Framers unquestionably did in Article II of the Constitution."
Throughout American history, attorneys general have intuited and acted upon their nonindependent subordination to presidents of the United States.
In "Conflicting Loyalties: Law and Politics in the Attorney General's Office, 1789-1990," the scholar Nancy V. Baker explored the historical nature of the attorney general's position. Baker devoted entire book sections to "The Attorney General as a Legal Advisor" and "The Attorney General as a Policy Advisor." She observed that "before he became an administrator" of a sprawling Department of Justice bureaucracy, "the attorney general assumed the role of the advisor to the president." What's more, the attorney general's "responsibility" to serve in such an advisory capacity "has antecedents in seventeenth-century England."
Indeed, the role of the attorney general as a top presidential adviser has been a recurring theme throughout American history. When President Lincoln's attorney general, Edward Bates, famously wrote to Congress in 1861 to defend Lincoln's unilateral suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, he did so not as a neutral arbiter of legal principle, but as Lincoln's top legal adviser who shared his superior's ultimate policy aim of a Union victory in the Civil War.
Similarly, President Franklin Roosevelt's wartime attorney general, Francis Biddle, ceased his vocal opposition to Japanese American internment after it became obvious that Roosevelt planned to sign the fateful Executive Order 9066. Biddle understood that he was not in any way independent of the president, but that he was a political appointee who had to support the president in order to keep his job.
In modern times, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which was created by Congress during the New Deal, provides "legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies" and reviews "all executive orders and substantive proclamations proposed to be issued by the president." The president also has at his disposal the White House counsel's office, but that office tends to focus on legal issues arising from legislation, executive and judicial branch nominations and ethics questions.
Though the Office of Legal Counsel does sometimes reach legal conclusions at loggerheads with the White House, it is hardly independent in any meaningful way. Former Acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron, who led the OLC during the early years of the Obama administration, once stated that the office's legal analyses "may appropriately reflect the fact that its responsibilities also include facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law." And legal scholarship has observed the "systematic deference" that the Office of Legal Counsel generally shows toward the president's prerogatives.
Eric Holder was correct the first time. The attorney general, in large part, actually is the president's "wingman."

Without question, a woman can win presidential election sun sentinel editorial

Texto completo: Yes, a woman can be elected president of the United States.
It's time to put that nonissue behind us.
One nearly was, and it wasn't her gender that dealt her a loss.
As Bernie Sanders pointed out in the Democratic debate in Iowa Tuesday night, "Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes."
Everywhere else, that would have been enough.
Regrettably, the United States is burdened with an anachronism called the Electoral College, reflecting the mistrust of small states for large ones. A system crafted to elect George Washington most recently served up someone most unlike him.
Just 77,000 more votes in three key states made the difference between a President Clinton and a President Trump four years ago; between having a First Man or a First Lady in the White House.
That was so close, it could have been Russia's meddling that made the difference. Or James Comey's October surprise. Or Clinton's failure to campaign in three normally safe states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - that she had lost to Sanders in the Democratic primaries.
It used to be said that a Roman Catholic couldn't be elected president. Then John F. Kennedy was.
Divorce was assumed to be a disqualification. Ronald Reagan disproved that.
Race was the next frontier. Then Barack Obama was elected.
In the current campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a formidable contender. She'd be even stronger if she weren't contending with Sanders for the same voters. She scored points in the Des Moines debate by observing, truthfully, that the men on the stage had collectively lost 10 elections while she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were undefeated.
That Klobuchar remains in a dwindling field reflects her potential as the moderate alternative to Sanders or Warren if Joe Biden doesn't do well in the early caucus and primary states. There is no question that either of those women is a qualified rival to Trump and would make a far superior president.
Male machismo and misogyny - the only reasons for even asking whether a woman could be president - are hardly unique to the United States. Yet 59 other nations, spanning the globe and every region and ethnicity, have had women as heads of government. Why hasn't it happened here?
One reason is that it took time to break the glass ceilings in Congress, state capitals and the vice presidency, which are the traditional proving grounds for presidential prospects.
Since women were enfranchised 101 years ago, only five Democratic women and two Republicans have attained enough political exposure and stature to be taken seriously as candidates in the two major parties. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was the first, opposing Barry Goldwater for the 1964 GOP nomination. Clinton gave Obama strong competition in 2008 before winning the nomination eight years later.
But only two women have been chosen as running mates, and both tickets lost - Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and John McCain and Sarah Palin in 2008.
Another reason is that many of those other nations, notably Great Britain and Israel, are parliamentary democracies that do not directly elect their heads of government. Their prime ministers have generally come up through party ranks, showcasing their talents. In our nation's infancy, it was the party caucuses in Congress that nominated presidential candidates.
The Democratic debates should have put to rest the gender issue. As New York Times columnist Frank Bruni observed, pointed questions could also be raised over age - Biden is 77 and Sanders is 78 - and over Pete Buttigieg's identity as a gay man who has a male spouse.
"Doesn't that make them risky nominees in their own ways?" Bruni wrote. "If Warren and Klobuchar were less polite and restrained, they might have said so last night. Instead they just turned in debate performances that showed just how commanding women are."
It was CNN, rather than any of the candidates, that performed the worst in the debate. That distinction owes to one of the moderators, Abby Phillip, who in effect called Sanders a liar after he denied Warren's claim that he had told her a woman couldn't be elected president.
Turning to Warren, Phillip asked her, "What did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?"
It was a loaded question that Sanders didn't get a chance to rebut. Poynter Institute media critic Tom Jones rightly called it "stunning in its ineptitude, stunning in its unprofessionalism."
Warren was clearly uncomfortable. "I disagreed," she said, and sought to change the subject.
So, can a woman be elected president?
Yes.
So can a man.
There is no material difference.
What really matters is who are qualified, competent and trustworthy.

That Fenty gent Meet Rihanna's creative 'right hand,' Jahleel Weaver

Texto completo: At 33, Jahleel Weaver has pretty much won the celebrity-stylist lottery.
As deputy creative director of Fenty, the women's ready-to-wear and accessories line introduced by Rihanna in May, his days are spent working alongside a nine-time Grammy Award winner whose clothing brand is backed by LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate, and released to her passionate fans without regard to conventional seasonal rhythms.
Theirs is a close relationship. "We talk almost every day," Weaver said. "I feel I'm her little brother," although Rihanna is younger, at 31.
"Creatively, he is my right hand," she wrote of Weaver in an email, "but at the same time, it's as if we're family."
The path that led Weaver to help guide the most talked-about fashion debut of 2019, founded by one of the most influential women in popular culture, was a long and gently winding one.
At 18, he moved from suburban Maryland to New York to study fashion design at LIM College. Weaver helped support himself by working in sales at Jeffrey, the high-end retailer in the meatpacking district known for its extensive shoe department and attentive customer service.
He quickly met some famous clients, many downtowners working in music, and began to style several. "To be working for, and building a brand," Weaver said, "I always think about my experience at Jeffrey."
Weaver was also making inroads working as a freelance stylist away from the store, and it was on one of these gigs that he met Mel Ottenberg, who is currently the creative director of Interview magazine. Ottenberg had just begun collaborating with Rihanna on her 2011 "Loud" tour and brought Weaver on to assist him.
Soon enough, Weaver and Rihanna became inseparable, traveling the globe together. (Ottenberg continues to style Rihanna on occasion, as he did in 2018, dressing her when she was a host of the Met Gala in a dazzling jewel-embroidered, papal-inspired Margiela ensemble.)
When Rihanna decided in 2014 to start the umbrella company Fenty Corp., giving it her last name, she asked Weaver to join as a junior creative director.
He was there to help her create the beauty line Fenty Beauty, which soon had legacy cosmetics brands scurrying to broaden the colors of foundation on offer; Savage x Fenty, a line of inclusive, body-positive-inspired lingerie, the show of which had fashion week attendees squealing in September; and Cameo, her everything-old-is-new-again jewelry line.
"The most valuable thing Jahleel brings to the process," Rihanna said, "is his complete understanding of my vision."
Virgil Abloh, the founder of the cult streetwear-inspired fashion line Off-White and the artistic director for menswear at Louis Vuitton (also part of LVMH), said the creative dynamic between Rihanna and Weaver has resulted in "looks that are cemented within popular culture." (Fuzzy slides were just the beginning.)
Abloh first came to know Weaver through what he refers to as an "international tribe of creatives," a community of designers and artists constantly on the move.
Weaver, although he continues to travel extensively, now lives primarily in Paris. He moved there in early 2018 to begin work on Fenty's debut, a fairly stressful undertaking.
"How do you put everything that Rihanna represents into one collection?" Weaver said.
The answer came to the pair late one night in the form of a music metaphor: an album and its release. Rather than settle on distinct, themed collections shown twice a year, Fenty would drop capsule collections throughout the year, much as singles are released over the course of an album's rollout.
This would heighten anticipation and set the brand apart from the grind of the fashion pack.
"Each release," Weaver said, "can speak to something different," with inspiration taken from various aspects of Rihanna's personal style, be it sleek futurism or the history of Cameo.
"At the end, you have a full album, a full body of work," Weaver said. "I think that's the beauty about our release schedule - there's a piece of Fenty for everything you might need to get dressed."
Basing Fenty's strategy around online drops was a radical move, jolting the old seasonal schedule with the hectic cadence of fast fashion.
But Fenty has been even more cutting edge in giving people of color a place at the top of an industry still plagued by racial inequality and insensitivity.
When Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH announced Fenty, Rihanna became the first woman and person of color to establish a house with the luxury retail giant. At a time when high-profile brands continue to be plagued by racist missteps - just this year Gucci was forced to recall a balaclava knit-top that resembled blackface - the significance of Fenty's debut was not lost on Weaver.
"All the barriers that were broken in that one day, with that one announcement," he said, "I actually cried."
Along with Abloh at Louis Vuitton and Olivier Rousteing running Balmain, Rihanna's entry into the field was further evidence to many that change, however overdue, is finally coming to the upper echelons of luxury fashion.
Weaver is feeling optimistic. "Because of people like Ri constantly breaking barriers," he said, "it makes it a lot easier to exist in space where representation for people of color didn't necessarily exist."
And his own place in that space?
"Honestly," Weaver said, "I think I'm still pinching myself."

Cities getting on board with free public transit

Texto completo: LAWRENCE, Mass. - Dionisia Ramos gets on the 37 bus twice a day, rooting through her handbag to dig out the fare and drop it into the slot, so it came as shock several months ago when the bus driver reached out his hand to stop her.
"You don't have to pay," he said. "It's free for the next two years."
Ramos had never heard of anything like this: Someone was paying her bus fare? At 55, she lives on a monthly unemployment check for $235. So saving $2.40 a day, for her trip to and from community college, past the hulking mills of Lawrence's industrial past - that meant something.
Since a pilot program began in September, use of the buses has grown by 24%, and the only criticism Ramos has of the city's experiment with fare-free transit is that it is not permanent.
"Transportation should be free," she said. "It's a basic need. It's not a luxury."
That argument is bubbling up in lots of places these days, as city officials cast about for big ideas to combat inequality and reduce carbon emissions. Some among them cast transportation as a pure public good, more like policing and less like toll roads.
The City Council in Worcester, Massachusetts' second-largest city, has expressed support for waiving fares for its buses, a move that would cost $2 million to $3 million a year in lost fares. And fare-free transit is the splashiest policy recommendation of Michelle Wu, a Boston City Council member who is expected by many to run for mayor in 2021.
Larger experiments are underway in other parts of the country. The cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Olympia, Washington, both declared that their buses would become fare-free this year.
The argument against fare-free transit is a simple one: Who is going to pay for it?
In communities where ridership has been falling, the cost of waiving fares may be less than expected.
Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence, intrigued after hearing his friend Wu speak about fare-free transit, asked his regional transit authority how much was collected on three of the city's most-used bus lines. The answer was such a small amount - $225,000 - that he could offset it from the city's surplus cash reserves.
"What I like is the doability of this, the simplicity of it," Rivera said. "We are already subsidizing this mode of transportation, so the final mile is very short. It isn't a service people need to pay for; it's a public good."
Around 100 cities in the world offer free public transit, the vast majority of them in Europe.
A handful of experiments in the United States in recent decades, including in the cities of Denver and Austin, Texas, were viewed as unsuccessful because there was little evidence that they removed cars from the road.
But in another sense, they were successful: They increased ridership right away, with rises from 20% to 60% in the first few months. That statistic accounts for its revival among a new wave of urban progressives.
"Think about who is using our buses: It's black people, folks who live in communities where there are deep, deep concentrations of poverty," said Kim Janey, who was sworn in recently as the president of Boston's City Council and has proposed waiving fares on a key route through some of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
In Boston, the idea has also run into resistance from officials who say the cost would be exorbitant.
Brian Kane, deputy director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which oversees expenditures on Boston's public transit system, said bus fares in Boston brought in $109 million in 2019 and $117 million in 2018.
"Someone has to pay," Kane said. "Boston has the highest-paid bus drivers in the country. They're not going to work for free. The fuelers, the mechanics - they're not going to work for free."

Texto completo: Rutgers University is expected to name Jonathan Holloway, the current provost of Northwestern University, as its 21st president on Tuesday.
Holloway, 52, will be the university's first black president. A joint meeting of the University's Board of Governors and Board of Trustees is set for 9 a.m. Tuesday.
Holloway, a historian, will replace current Rutgers President Robert Barchi, who has served the university since September 2012 and will step down at the end of the school year.
In addition to holding administrative roles, Holloway is a professor of history and African American studies, focusing on post-emancipation U.S. history.
Here's what else we know about Rutgers' next leader.
He comes from another Big Ten research institution Holloway was most recently Northwestern University's provost, a position he took in July 2017.
Holloway led Northwestern through a $94 million budget deficit in 2018. He also created new resources for first-generation and low-income students and implemented a new review process for deans, according to The Daily Northwestern.
In late 2018, Holloway defended the university's decision to allow controversial researcher Satoshi Kanazawa on campus for a year as a visiting scholar.
Faculty and students decried Kanazawa's work as racist and sexist. But officials, citing academic freedom and Kanazawa's limited role at the university, declined to expel him from campus.
"I find that his scholarship presents ideas that are antithetical to values that Northwestern University holds dear," Holloway said. "I have discovered that the system for vetting a visiting professor in Kanazawa's host department was weak, and that the department was unaware of Kanazawa's controversial views or his flawed scholarship."
Holloway also said he expected more rigorous vetting policies for visiting professors.
He was at the center of Yale protests Holloway was the first black dean of Yale College, a role he filled from 2014 to 2017.
But in addition to his roles as administrator and professor Holloway, who teaches about the civil rights era, found himself in the middle of on-campus racial protests in 2015.
The protests were set off by an email from the university's Intercultural Affairs Committee that asked students to avoid culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. A faculty member challenged the request, and tensions flared.
Holloway, who supported the request, worked to repair frayed relationships between students and the university and was known as receptive to student demands.
Yet he was also criticized by some students who said he remained disconnected from their problems and wasn't doing enough to mend race relations on campus.
At one impromptu protest, the New York Times reported, Holloway spent two hours listening to nearly 200 black students voice their concerns.
A year later, Holloway announced he would leave Yale to become provost of Northwestern. He said the decision was not related to the protests.
Holloway earned his doctorate in history from Yale in 1995. He spent 22 years at the institution.
He was a football player Holloway grew up in Montgomery, Alabama, but moved to California to attend Stanford University.
While earning his undergraduate degree, he played outside linebacker for Stanford Cardinal football. One of his teammates was U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.
"He and I were there at the same time," Holloway told The Daily Northwestern in August. "In fact, we were both recruited by the same guy. He played wide receiver and just couldn't cut it there and sort of was on the same track I was: Big recruit, flame out."
Holloway earned USA Today All-American honorable mention in high school. He also ran indoor and outdoor track. But in college, he said, athletics were frustrating.
"I was a hot shot recruit who ended up being a complete scrub when I got there," Holloway told The Daily Northwestern. "So my favorite memories are just friendships that I've made."

Texto completo: A dictatorial move
At 87 years old, I am dismayed and shaken. Our precious Constitution has taken a body blow and is down for the count - a blow not from a foreign foe but from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He has made the unheard-of announcement that in the Senate trial of the president he (with his Senate followers) and President Donald Trump are in lock-step agreement to prevent the president's conviction. Our Constitution is being dismantled. Trump wants to block any witnesses from being subpoenaed during his trial.
McConnell is attempting to prevent witnesses for the prosecution. He and his Senate followers, prior to trial, have already said they will vote against conviction of the president - a frightening dismissal of the Constitution.
Ronald Kledzik, M.D., Norfolk
Consider accomplishments
A recent New York Times op-ed purported that President Donald Trump is faring badly with the demographic called "suburban women." A very dear friend who fits the description visited recently and confirmed her firm opposition to the president.
I queried her about what I call my kitchen-table issues. What about his jobs record across all groups including women, and his policies dealing with regulations, energy, the military, veterans and the stellar performance of the economy over his first three years?
What about his efforts to deal with border security, infrastructure, and prescription cost issues? What about his trade and foreign policy objectives that are showing great promise? Is the country prouder and better off than we were four, eight or 12 years ago? My friend agreed that in these areas Trump has done "OK." "So why won't you vote for him?" I asked.
Her answer: "I just can't abide the man."
Trump's persona may be the tragic flaw that prevents him from becoming one of our great presidents, but my kitchen table buddies and I will overlook his personality and hope he gets the opportunity to complete his agenda for America.
I hope the "suburban women" and all other demographic groups will reflect carefully on what he's actually accomplished before they pull the voting lever.
Thomas V. Moore, Virginia Beach
Watched with pride
I was among the huge TV audience who witnessed Chief Justice John Roberts administer the oath to our U.S. senators at the preliminary proceedings of the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
I watched with pride as Virginia's two senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, solemnly signed the oath record book. And I believe they will listen to the impeachment testimonies with fair, impartial open minds before they are asked to vote.
I am so thankful they are my senators. I am so thankful I do not have to defend them for saying - before the cameras - "My mind is made up; I don't want to hear any evidence." At least one senator did that. Shame.
Dorothy Goodwin, Virginia Beach
Partisan circus underway
I began drafting my articles of impeachment for whomever is the next Democratic president. I realize that sounds ridiculous, but it is no more ridiculous than the partisan circus being made of our republic now.
They don't like, they can't stand it, and they can't believe the results of the election so they must tear it down. Like him or not, imagine the work on our behalf that could be accomplished if they worked together?
How much is Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi getting for the souvenir pens? Maybe she could apply the proceeds to repairing infrastructure, lowering prescription drug prices or helping solve the opioid epidemic.
James Bulloch, Newport News
Questionable timing
No one should mourn the death of Gen. Qassem Soleimani. What is questionable is the president's motive in ordering the strike now, whether or not he had proper authorization. Former President Barack Obama refused to arm Ukraine with the necessary anti-tank weapons, a decision I questioned until I heard Fiona Hill's testimony in the House Intelligence Committee hearings. Apparently the timing was right for President Donald Trump to authorize those weapons. Kudos to whoever was able make that justification; they have held the Russians at bay. But these weapons were authorized to a government which had done practically nothing to halt corruption.
Hunter Biden's company was not under investigation, along with many others the corrupt chief prosecutor was ignoring. His father's insistence on removing him actually put that company in danger of prosecution. Then a new president was elected who was proving to our foreign service professionals that he was taking the steps to fight corruption. Why then did Trump pick this moment to withhold the money for more needed weapons?
It seems apparent that he did it for the same reason he authorized the strike on Soleimani now, like finding dirt on the Bidens, will help his reelection efforts.
My great concern is that he will continue to make unilateral decisions to strike without consulting our own professionals, much less our allies, driving us closer to the war he promised to end.
Mannie Smith, Norfolk

PSO program favors variety over unity

Texto completo: When conductors assemble their programs, they often rely on a handful of time-tested templates. For the last few decades, the most popular of these was a template built on the notion that programming should be thematic, and you can understand why: Being able to trace connections between works, and the ideas they embody, through decades or even centuries, gives a program an extra-musical coherence, and can seem especially thoughtful.
Judging by his programs this season and next, Eckart Preu seems less interested in finding unifying themes than in presenting the greatest variety possible in a two-hour concert, but his programs have been useful reminders that this can be an equally satisfying approach, when it's done well.
Yet it is also a characteristic of the human mind to seek connections whenever possible, even if they require a stretch. When Preu conducted the Portland Symphony Orchestra at Merrill Auditorium on Sunday, he presented three works that could not be more diverse: the world premiere of Robin Holcomb's "No Thing Lives to Itself," the Saint-SaÃ«ns Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor (Op. 22), and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2 ("Little Russian," Op. 17). No connections, right?
Not so fast. Holcomb's work is inspired by Rachel Carson, whose books - most notably, "Silent Spring" (1953) - warned that our polluting ways were destined to destroy Earth's ecology. And the nickname of Tchaikovsky's symphony, "Little Russian," refers to a 19th-century Russian nickname for Ukraine. With climate change and Ukraine both in the news, we suddenly have the makings of a program focused, at least obliquely, on current issues. (I haven't yet found a role for the Saint-SaÃ«ns.)
Holcomb's piece, commissioned for the PSO by the League of American Orchestras, as part of its Women Composers Readings and Commissions program (underwritten by the Virginia B. Toulmin Foundation), draws its title from a phrase Carson used frequently to indicate that everything on the planet has an effect on, and is affected by, everything else.
Holcomb did not take the easiest route toward capturing this idea in music. That would have been a theme-and-variations set, with musical evocations of nature, like the bird songs and thunderstorm in Beethoven's Sixth Symphony. Instead, she has written a 13-minute work so episodic as to seem diffuse at times, with lovely neo-Romantic scoring and sweeping, lyrical themes giving way to more modernist touches (particularly in her use of percussion). Exactly how these episodes influence each other was difficult to fully grasp on a single listening, also some of the juxtapositions - a symmetrical string passage interrupted by mechanistic percussion, which in turn is enveloped in the full orchestra texture - seemed clear enough.
Saint-SaÃ«ns is a composer whose capacity for producing entertaining works - and his Piano Concerto No. 2 is one - has overshadowed the skill and fluidity he brought to the task. Preu has programmed a more regal example of his work next season, the Symphony No. 3, which has a prominent organ part that should sound magnificent on Merrill's Kotzschmar organ. But there is plenty to admire in his concertos, and Ran Dank sounded ideally suited to his music on Sunday.
Dank's playing was fleet and trim, not only in the Presto finale, where those qualities also embrace an appealing athleticism, but also in the alternately delicate and extroverted passages that animate the first two movements. The piano is often heard unaccompanied in this piece, but there is plenty of beautifully nuanced orchestral writing as well, and here, Preu's shaping and the fine contributions of the principal winds proved as enlivening as Dank's nimble pianism.
Preu devoted the second half to a superbly balanced, solidly played performance of the Tchaikovsky symphony, with excellent solo work by principal hornist Lauren Winter in the first movement. Both in his pre-concert talk and his introduction to the work from the stage, he duly noted that the first, second and fourth movements drew on Ukrainian folk themes. He could do us a favor, though - a performance of the folk themes on their own would clarify Tchaikovsky's sources for listeners unfamiliar with them.
There were times when one could quibble with Preu's tempos. The finale, while suitably brisk, gave the music a breathless quality that impinged slightly on the shapeliness of Tchaikovsky's themes, and the second movement, Andantino marziale, struck me as slightly slow, for a military march. But in that case, Preu's tempo had the benefit of clarifying Tchaikovsky's textural details. Agree with his choices or not, you invariably get the impression that Preu has considered them carefully.

Texto completo: Today's Food and Drug Administration moves much faster than it used to. That may not always be a good thing.
A review of drug approvals by the agency from researchers at Harvard Medical School released last week found that the FDA is approving drugs more rapidly with weaker evidence than it did in the past. That can be beneficial when it leads to needed medicines getting to market quickly, and I believe that's the agency's intent. As the study's authors highlight, however, this emphasis on speed and flexibility could be eroding standards. It may be time for a gut check.
The gold standard for demonstrating efficacy - and the surest way of winning drug approval - is to demonstrate success in large, well-controlled studies that result in a hard outcome. But there are faster ways to get to market.
In 1992, Congress created the accelerated approval program, which can greenlight medicines based on "surrogate" endpoints that predict rather than confirm benefit for patients, or those that have shown a shorter-term benefit. It's one of several initiatives that have changed how the agency works. According to the study, 80.6% of approvals between 1995 and 1997 were supported by at least two pivotal trials. That number dropped to 52.8% between 2005 and 2017.
Companies that get accelerated approval have to prove their drug works with a confirmatory trial in order to gain full approval, but there's no hard timetable for when that must be done. Thus, drugmakers often don't hurry to conduct those tests. This is problematic at best, dangerous at worst.
Here's just one case: In 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. sought approval of a medicine to treat a rare muscle-wasting disease in young boys based on weak evidence from a tiny trial. In the face of significant public pressure, the FDA approved Exondys 51 even though one of its scientists called the treatment "an elegant placebo" in a report. Sarepta is selling the drug for over $300,000 a year but has continually delayed a confirmatory trial. It's now years away from completion, and there have been no real consequences for the delay.
When companies do complete post-approval trials, it sometimes reveals a mistake. Eli Lilly&Co.'s cancer drug Lartruvo got accelerated approval in 2016. Lilly then pulled the medicine from the market last year after a larger trial found no benefit. That's a rare outcome, but there are many expensive drugs on the market that have never moved beyond surrogate endpoints. A study of 93 accelerated cancer drug approvals between 1992 and 2017 found that only 19 had proved to help patients live longer in a follow-up trial.
There are some good reasons for faster approvals, as former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb outlined in a Twitter response this week to a critical New York Times editorial penned on Jan. 11. Scientists are better at evaluating the safety of medicines and trial design has improved, for example. And advances have made it easier to create drugs that target small populations and have dramatic effects, Mr. Gottlieb wrote.
He makes good points. But the agency arguably hasn't found the right balance between embracing advances and maintaining a high bar. It certainly has a ways to go on post-approval follow up. America is entirely unable to control the price of new medicines; the approval of marginal drugs has financial consequences.
The FDA will soon face one of its most important and controversial decisions yet. Biogen Inc. is seeking approval for the first purportedly disease-modifying Alzheimer's drug - a medicine that could be used by millions of people and cost billions - without good evidence that it works. The agency often uses unmet need as a justification for shifting standards, and there's no bigger unmet need than Alzheimer's. That doesn't justify an approval based on one failed trial and another that is a questionable success at best.
The agency will have to decide whether to review or approve the medicine in the next year or so. This choice is an opportunity to resist public pressure and move back toward demanding firmer proof of efficacy before drugs hit the market.

Texto completo: DAVOS, Switzerland
The World Economic Forum, the most concentrated gathering of wealth and power on the planet, will begin once again amid a natural fortress of snow and ice in the Swiss Alps. President Donald Trump is jetting in for a scheduled address today. Dozens of other world leaders are in attendance; a who's who list of CEOs, fund managers, oligarchs and a smattering of celebrities will join the throngs cramming the pop-up pavilions and swanky hotel parties of the otherwise sleepy mountain town.
This year's conclave will be the 50th since it began in 1971, marking a fitful half-century of political turmoil and economic boom and bust. For years, Davos - that is, the conference of global leaders for which it has become synonymous - has represented the apotheosis of a particular world view: an almost Promethean belief in the virtues of liberalism and globalization, anchored in a conviction that heads of companies can become capable and even moral custodians of the common good.
The disruptions and traumas of the past decade have sorely tested Davos' faith in itself. The archetypal Davos Man - the well-heeled, jet-setting "globalist" - has become an object of derision and distrust for both the political left and right. Financial crises, surging nationalist populism in the West, China's intensifying authoritarianism and the steady toll of climate change have convinced many that there's nothing inexorable about liberal progress. A new global opinion poll of tens of thousands of people found that more than 50% of those surveyed now think capitalism does "more harm than good."
Each year, the forum is accompanied by an unsurprising airing of cynicism in the media. "It is (a) family reunion for the people who, in my view, broke the modern world," Anand Giradharadas, an author and outspoken critic of billionaire philanthropy, said in a TV interview last year. Can Davos "keep its mojo?" the Economist asked over the weekend. "Once a beacon of international cooperation, Davos has become a punchline," The New York Times noted.
Klaus Schwab, the forum's octogenarian founder and executive chairman, is convinced that the current moment needs more Davos, not less. In the run-up to this week's meetings, he announced a new "Davos manifesto," calling on companies to "pay their fair share of taxes, show zero tolerance for corruption, uphold human rights throughout their global supply chains and advocate for a competitive level playing field." Such an ethos, Mr. Schwab contends, will go a long way to redressing the world's inequities and may help governments meet the climate targets set by the 2015 Paris agreement.
"Business leaders now have an incredible opportunity," Mr. Schwab wrote in a column published last month. "By giving stakeholder capitalism concrete meaning, they can move beyond their legal obligations and uphold their duty to society."
Mr. Schwab's extolling of"stakeholder" capitalism - a riposte to the profit-maximizing Western orthodoxy of "shareholder" capitalism - is supposed to be a call to action. Activists, though, may argue that it's not enough.
In a study timed in conjunction with the World Economic Forum, Oxfam found that the world's billionaires control more wealth than 4.6 billion people, or 60% of humanity. "Another year, another indication that the inequality crisis is spiraling out of control. And despite repeated warnings about inequality, governments have not reversed its course," said Paul O'Brien of Oxfam America in an emailed statement. "Some governments, especially the U.S., are actually exacerbating inequality by cutting taxes for the richest and for corporations while slashing public services and safety nets - such as health care and education - that actually fight inequality."
And some Davos attendees concur. "The economic pie is bigger than it's ever been before in history, which means we could make everyone better off, but we've chosen as a society to leave a lot of people behind," Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, told my Washington Post colleague Heather Long. "That's not just inexcusable morally but is also really bad tactically."
Reading from a totally different script, Mr. Trump is expected to wax lyrical about the success of his economic and trade policies. In the past, his bullying measures and fondness for tariffs have ruffled the Davos set.
"Although the president has been inconsistent in how he has carried out his worldview, he has made clear that he has no plans to back away from his strong-arm tactics even as they have increasingly antagonized American friends and foes alike, leaving the United States potentially more isolated on the world stage," wrote my Post colleagues Anne Gearan and John Hudson.
Mr. Trump is also likely to be challenged in Davos by a growing cohort of climate activists and policymakers. Swedish teen campaigner Greta Thunberg will also speak today, and she is expected to berate politicians and finance executives who still invest in fossil fuels. Although Mr. Trump almost certainly will not heed Greta's call, representatives of major companies attending the forum are desperate to show how they are adapting their business models to accommodate climate concerns.
Two years ago, Mr. Schwab drew criticism for what was viewed as an awkwardly ingratiating speech to welcome Mr. Trump to the forum. Now, he's more at odds with the U.S. president, not least on the urgency of the climate crisis.
"We do not want to reach the tipping point of irreversibility on climate change," Mr. Schwab told reporters last week. "We do not want the next generations to inherit a world which becomes ever more hostile and ever less habitable."

Texto completo: Two people were killed and 15 others wounded Sunday in Kansas City, Mo., when a gunman opened fire on a line of people outside a bar, police said.
The shooting began about 11:30 p.m., following a disturbance among the crowd of people waiting to get inside the 9ine Ultra Lounge, southeast of the city's downtown, Kansas City police Chief Richard Smith said at a Monday news conference. The suspect killed one woman before an armed security guard confronted, shot and killed him, Chief Smith said.
Authorities described "a chaotic scene" as hundreds fled the venue by foot and in cars, the violence shattering the city's celebration of its football team, the Kansas City Chiefs, who had just advanced to the Super Bowl - what was "an exciting night, a euphoric night," Mayor Quinton Lucas said.
"Last night was a night many people in Kansas City have been dreaming of for 50 years," Mr. Lucas said at the news conference. "This is very disappointing for us. It's heartbreaking."
Authorities said the woman killed was 25-year-old Raven Parks, and they identified the shooter as Jahron Swift, 29.
Shooting suspect nabbed
A suspect has been arrested in connection with a deadly shooting at a San Antonio bar on Sunday night that left two dead and five injured, according to police.
Kiernan Christopher Williams, 19, was arrested on Monday afternoon and faces capital murder charges.
San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said police received calls of shots fired at Ventura, in the city's popular River Walk area around 8 p.m. Police said the shooting was "not a random" incident and believe Mr. Williams knew at least one of the victims.
Robert Jay Martinez III, 20, and 25-year-old Alejandro Robles were pronounced dead at the scene.
NYT endorses 2 Dems
The New York Times editorial board endorsed the two leading female candidates for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination on Sunday, throwing its support behind Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
The board's decision to back not one but two candidates is a significant break with convention, one that it says is meant to address the "realist" and "radical" models being presented to voters by the 2020 Democratic field. While arguing that President Donald Trump must be defeated, the board does not take a position on the best path forward for Democrats, writing that both approaches "warrant serious consideration."
The two female senators have released some of the most detailed policy plans of the candidates remaining in the primary campaign, prompting the board to praise each one as the "standard-bearer" for her wing of the party.
Barr recusal sought
Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas demanded Monday that Attorney General William Barr recuse himself from his criminal case over allegations that Mr. Barr played a part in President Donald Trump's hunt for Ukrainian dirt on Democrats.
Mr. Parnas, who broke with Team Trump and is angling to testify at the president's Senate impeachment trial, had his lawyer, Joseph Bondy, send a letter to Mr. Barr outlining several purported conflicts of interests that should preclude the attorney general from having any sway over the ex-Giuliani pal's case.
"Given the totality of the circumstances, we believe it is appropriate for you to recuse yourself from the ongoing investigation and pending prosecution of Mr. Parnas," Mr. Bondy wrote.

Main Street: The State of Trump's Union

Texto completo: On Tuesday at 1 p.m., the Senate will begin the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. But for Congress, the more important date may come two weeks later, on Feb. 4. That evening President Trump -- freshly vindicated by the impeachment failure to remove him from office -- will deliver the most consequential State of the Union address of his presidency thus far.
Right now most press coverage is obsessing over impeachment minutiae. Will former national security adviser John Bolton testify? If he does, will Republicans insist that Hunter Biden, and maybe even Joe Biden, be called as well? Were the celebratory impeachment signing pens given out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appropriate for what she claims was a "solemn" occasion? How long will the trial take? And so on.
Given that we already know how this story ends -- even with a few defectors, Democrats are unlikely to come close to the 20 Republican votes they need to convict Mr. Trump -- all these are distractions. The big question is what comes after impeachment fails and the president is still standing.
Assuming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivers the swift trial Republicans expect, it would mean a State of the Union delivered by a newly triumphant Mr. Trump. In contrast to the low ratings that have characterized the impeachment coverage thus far, many more Americans are sure to tune in to the State of the Union to see what a Donald Trump liberated from impeachment will say. The heightened interest comes courtesy of the overreach by his many enemies: intelligence chiefs who falsely called him a Russian agent, a press corps that has dropped objective reporting as an unaffordable luxury and, of course, the House Democrats who presided over the most partisan impeachment in U.S. history.
Mr. Trump won't be the first to emerge politically strengthened by the failure of his antagonists. Bill Clinton also went through the same process and came out stronger, notwithstanding the impeachment asterisk that sticks to his name in the history books.
There were some differences. After the House impeached him Mr. Clinton's approval rating jumped to 73% -- the highest rating he ever enjoyed and higher than even Ronald Reagan at his peak. The Republicans who controlled the Senate during Mr. Clinton's trial were more divided than the Senate Republicans who will run this trial. And Mr. Clinton, who was not running for re-election, delivered his 1999 State of the Union in mid-January -- in the midst of his Senate trial, not after it.
Still, it's worth looking back at Mr. Clinton's impeachment State of the Union for clues about what Mr. Trump might say. In 1999, Mr. Clinton made no mention of impeachment. Instead, he invoked a humming American economy and asked Congress to put partisanship aside and come together to fix Social Security and address other issues affecting ordinary Americans.
"Tonight," Mr. Clinton said, "I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history -- with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957."
"America," declared Mr. Clinton, "is working again."
Then he went on the road. Two days later, the New York Times ran a story with this headline: "Clinton Gets a Rock-Star Reception at 2 Northeast Rallies." According to the story, "an exuberant President Clinton starred today in two rollicking rallies." The Times piece went on to quote the African-American preacher who delivered the invocation as saying Mr. Clinton had been "the greatest president for our people of all time." Sound like anyone we know?
Remember, Mr. Clinton was doing all this while his fate as president was still in the Senate's hands. When Mr. Trump gets his night at the House podium, by contrast, almost certainly it will be after the Senate has either voted to acquit or dismissed the charges against him.
It's not hard to imagine Mr. Trump's outdoing Mr. Clinton in emphasizing his real achievements, including an economy that's delivering prosperity not only for Wall Street but for Main Street. African-Americans, for example, are working at record numbers, and their average wage growth now outpaces wage growth for white Americans. In foreign policy, he can boast of an America that doesn't seek war but won't hesitate to use lethal force against those who would kill Americans. Like Mr. Clinton, too, Mr. Trump will no doubt end by calling on lawmakers to put past disputes behind them so they can come together to carry out his agenda for the American people.
Simply by addressing the nation from the House podium, the president will underscore the weakness of Mrs. Pelosi and her caucus. The implicit message will be this: You have thrown everything at me, including the constitutional equivalent of a nuclear weapon. Yet here I am.
Friedrich Nietzsche famously wrote that "what does not kill me makes me stronger." At this year's State of the Union, Mr. Trump may be the living proof.

Texto completo: 'Last week," President Obama declared a decade ago, "the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections."
Mr. Obama was wrong in almost every respect about Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which the court decided on Jan. 21, 2010. Hysterical predictions about Citizens United -- then-Rep. Ed Markey, among others, compared it to Dred Scott -- haven't held up.
Contrary to Mr. Obama's assertion about a century of law, Citizens United overturned portions of McCain-Feingold, a campaign-finance law that wasn't even 10 years old, and another law from 1947. Those laws prohibited unions and corporations, including nonprofits, from voicing support for or opposition to candidates for federal office.
Citizens United didn't affect the longstanding ban on corporate contributions to candidates, and it didn't legalize foreign political spending in the U.S. Most Russian online ads in 2016 would have been protected under the First Amendment even before Citizens United, because the ads didn't urge a vote for or against a candidate.
Far from handing power to the 1%, Citizens United unleashed rapid political diversification. Since the ruling, the White House or Congress has changed parties in every federal election except 2012. Twenty eighteen saw the highest midterm voter turnout in a century. Small-dollar donors are more coveted than ever. Donald Trump raised more money from donors who gave less than $200 than any candidate in history.
Since Citizens United, party outsiders such as Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders have risen to national prominence. And money hasn't been able to buy elections as predicted. Sheldon Adelson donated record amounts to Republican super PACs in 2012 but failed to prevent strong Democratic victories. Democrats Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg came up empty after putting huge sums of money behind climate change and gun control.
Hillary Clinton outspent Mr. Trump 3 to 1 in 2016. Congressional leaders and big-time fundraisers such as Reps. Eric Cantor (R., Va.) and Joe Crowley (D., N.Y.) lost their seats to primary challengers who spent a fraction of what the incumbents did. Incumbent re-election rates in the House never dipped below 94% from 1996 to 2008, but did in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Citizens United deserves a share of credit for all these trends. The decision made it easier to promote (or criticize) a candidate without help from party leaders or media elites.
Perhaps the worst prediction was that Citizens United would allow a corporate takeover of democracy. The New York Times accused the justices of having "paved the way for corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections" and "thrust politics back to the robber-baron era of the 19th century."
A decade later, most spending comes from the same place it always has: individuals who donate directly to candidates, up to legally limited amounts. Corporations contribute well under 10% of federal political spending, Their voice is not dominant -- and voters have a right to hear it. Justice Anthony Kennedy and his colleagues didn't hold that "money is speech" or "corporations are people." The ruling was part of a healthy shift in favor of free speech in politics -- a trend that began with 2007's Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, and continued through 2014's McCutcheon v. FEC.
The questions is whether the justices think their work is done. If they truly want to empower democracy, they should continue to look skeptically at regulation of campaign finance. Political speech, after all, is at the core of the First Amendment's protection.

Texto completo: In Congress, bipartisan concern builds over Esper's review of region
The Pentagon is facing growing pressure from Congress to maintain U.S. troop levels in Africa as the Defense Department considers significantly reducing the American presence to refocus on the Asia-Pacific region.
Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper has undertaken a review of each geographic combatant command, its missions and assignments, and will assess whether allies and partner nations can take on more responsibilities, said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman.
The review began with the region under U.S. Africa Command, which includes the entire continent except for Egypt, which falls under U.S. Central Command. President Trump has said that he wants to get the United States out of 'ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home.'
Although Pentagon officials say no decisions have been made, the effort has generated a rising bipartisan tide of concern that the United States will cede influence to rival nations such as Russia and China and do less to counter extremist groups with links to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State.
'Any drawdown of our troops would be shortsighted, could cripple Africom's ability to execute its mission and, as a result, would harm national security,' said Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who has generally been a strong supporter of the Trump administration.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), another Trump ally, also raised the issue in a letter to Esper that expressed 'serious concern regarding reports of a possible decision to significantly reduce or completely withdraw U.S. Armed Forces,' especially in West Africa. The letter was co-signed by Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.).
The cuts are under consideration as high-profile attacks by militants from Niger to Kenya have rattled nerves and raised concerns about stability and security. On Jan. 5, one U.S. service member and two U.S. contractors were killed in an attack carried out by the Somali militant group al-Shabab on an airfield in Kenya, highlighting the group's ability to extend beyond Somalia.
But the Pentagon for two years has signaled a national defense strategy that emphasizes shifting to the Asia-Pacific region to better counter Russia and China, pushing counterterrorism down on the list of priorities.
Esper has described the strategy as 'our guiding beacon.' But he has also deployed thousands of additional service members to the Middle East following months of turmoil with Iran, including a U.S. drone strike this month that killed an Iranian military commander blamed for the deaths of hundreds of U.S. service members. The death of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani and retaliatory attacks by Iran on bases housing U.S. forces in Iraq briefly raised the specter of open warfare.
The Pentagon has about 6,000 troops in Africa, including about 1,400 in West Africa, primarily in Niger, said Air Force Col. Chris Karns, a military spokesman. Some 4,400 are in East Africa, with most in Djibouti, and between 650 and 800 in Somalia, where the U.S. military advises African forces combating al-Shabab.
A senior defense official, who like several other officials interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said that changes in Africa could include a greater reliance on a concept the Pentagon calls 'dynamic force employment,' in which troops are moved with little notice to demonstrate a U.S. presence and unpredictability. The Pentagon has used that model to do things such as showcase an aircraft carrier, but it is unclear how well it will apply in Africa, where small teams of service members are often distributed across large areas.
Another senior defense official said that although no decisions have been made, Esper has concerns about past 'mission creep,' in which efforts gradually expand because service members already are deployed.

Army Gen. Stephen Townsend, the Africa Command chief, will visit Washington this week for previously scheduled meetings at the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill, two defense officials said. But the cuts, first reported by the New York Times last month, are sure to be discussed.
The issue has also caught the attention of the French government, which has about 4,500 troops deployed to Mali and nearby nations and relies on American support for intelligence, transportation, surveillance and aerial refueling to fight extremists.
French Defense Minister Florence Parly said recently that she will travel to Washington this month amid growing concern that the United States could withdraw forces. French President Emmanuel Macron announced Jan. 13 that he is sending hundreds more troops to West Africa and urged other European countries to join the battle, expressing alarm over the prospect of losing the 'irreplaceable' help of the U.S. military.
Concerns about a U.S. withdrawal have grown, and Western officials say the Sahel region, which lies south of the Sahara Desert, risks becoming an expansive refuge for terrorists planning attacks worldwide.
Militants linked to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda have chased hundreds of thousands of people from their homes in recent months, rendering once-peaceful communities uninhabitable as they kill indiscriminately.

Fourteen people, mostly children, died earlier this month in northern Burkina Faso when their bus rolled over a roadside bomb. Eighty-nine soldiers were killed in western Niger a week later after suspected terrorists ambushed an army base for the second time in as many months, staging the deadliest strike on the country's security forces in recent memory.

Extremist groups that previously clashed with one another appear to be working together, U.S. and European officials say.
Sahelian leaders are pouring a collective $1 billion into the fight and expanding military recruitment efforts on some of Earth's harshest terrain. The United Nations has roughly 14,000 peacekeepers in Mali, which is considered the epicenter of the conflict.
A senior military officer with Africa Command, Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler, played down the significance of the Pentagon's review, calling it 'nothing more than an assessment of globally aligning resources' to the U.S. defense strategy. However, he indicated that growing security concerns in Africa complicate it.

On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have pushed for more details about what the plan might include.
Last Tuesday, a bipartisan group in the House sent a missive to Esper arguing that a 'narrow focus on confronting Russia and China in great power competition is a shortsighted action.' Doing so, 'diminishes our overall national security posture and our ability to lead with American values and influence,' lawmakers wrote.
Rep. Anthony G. Brown (D-Md.), one of the co-signers, said that before visiting Mali, Niger and Nigeria last summer with three other lawmakers, he believed the United States should reduce its troop presence in Africa. But after seeing how U.S. Special Operations forces and aid workers collaborate to provide stability and an American foothold on the continent, he now thinks a modest increase makes more sense, he said.
'It's really just preserving relationships and making sure that China, particularly, does not become a partner out of necessity,' Brown, a retired Army officer, said in an interview.
Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.), a retired Green Beret officer who also signed the letter, said that although he agrees the Pentagon must prepare for competition with China and Russia, he worries the 'pendulum can swing too far' from counterterrorism and stability operations.
He cited Russian involvement in Libya and the possibility of the Russian military gaining a port there.
'I'm looking at a small footprint and what it costs us now versus what it could cost us in the long run by pulling back,' he said.

Texto completo: LAWRENCE, Mass. - Dionisia Ramos gets on the 37 bus twice a day, rooting through her handbag to dig out the fare and drop it into the slot, so it came as shock several months ago when the bus driver reached out his hand to stop her.
"You don't have to pay," he said. "It's free for the next two years."
Ramos had never heard of anything like this: Someone was paying her bus fare? At 55, she lives on a monthly unemployment check for $235. So saving $2.40 a day, for her trip to and from community college, past the hulking mills of Lawrence's industrial past - that meant something.
Since a pilot program began in September, use of the buses has grown by 24%, and the only criticism Ramos has of the city's experiment with fare-free transit is that it is not permanent.
"Transportation should be free," she said. "It's a basic need. It's not a luxury."
That argument is bubbling up in lots of places these days, as city officials cast about for big ideas to combat inequality and reduce carbon emissions. Some among them cast transportation as a pure public good, more like policing and less like toll roads.
The City Council in Worcester, Massachusetts' second-largest city, has expressed support for waiving fares for its buses, a move that would cost $2 million to $3 million a year in lost fares. And fare-free transit is the splashiest policy recommendation of Michelle Wu, a Boston City Council member who is expected by many to run for mayor in 2021.
Larger experiments are underway in other parts of the country. The cities of Kansas City, Missouri, and Olympia, Washington, both declared that their buses would become fare-free this year.
The argument against fare-free transit is a simple one: Who is going to pay for it?
In communities where ridership has been falling, the cost of waiving fares may be less than expected.
Mayor Daniel Rivera of Lawrence, intrigued after hearing his friend Wu speak about fare-free transit, asked his regional transit authority how much was collected on three of the city's most-used bus lines. The answer was such a small amount - $225,000 - that he could offset it from the city's surplus cash reserves.
"What I like is the doability of this, the simplicity of it," Rivera said. "We are already subsidizing this mode of transportation, so the final mile is very short. It isn't a service people need to pay for; it's a public good."
Around 100 cities in the world offer free public transit, the vast majority of them in Europe.
A handful of experiments in the United States in recent decades, including in the cities of Denver and Austin, Texas, were viewed as unsuccessful because there was little evidence that they removed cars from the road.
But in another sense, they were successful: They increased ridership right away, with rises from 20% to 60% in the first few months. That statistic accounts for its revival among a new wave of urban progressives.
"Think about who is using our buses: It's black people, folks who live in communities where there are deep, deep concentrations of poverty," said Kim Janey, who was sworn in recently as the president of Boston's City Council and has proposed waiving fares on a key route through some of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
In Boston, the idea has also run into resistance from officials who say the cost would be exorbitant.
Brian Kane, deputy director of the MBTA Advisory Board, which oversees expenditures on Boston's public transit system, said bus fares in Boston brought in $109 million in 2019 and $117 million in 2018.

Texto completo: 2020 nominees of the major categories include few people of color
It's Oscars season. And, once again, critics are pointing out the lack of racial diversity among the nominees.
Although the conversation about representation during awards season has become more prominent in recent years, artists have long called out the Academy Awards for doing a poor job of recognizing the work of people who aren't white.
Only one black actor received a nomination this year: Cynthia Erivo for best actress for 'Harriet' (she also received a nod for best song).
'It's not enough that I'm the only one. It just isn't,' she told the New York Times last week, noting 'far too much work was done this year by incredible women and men of color that should be celebrated.'
Her words echoed Eddie Murphy's from the 1988 Oscars ceremony. Before presenting the winner for best picture, Murphy told the audience that he initially declined the invitation from the academy, and reenacted the conversation he had with his manager about it: '-'I'm not going [to the Oscars] because they haven't recognized black people in motion pictures.' He said, 'What are you talking about? Black people win Oscars!' I said, 'Well, black actors and actresses have won Oscars throughout 60 years " it was like Hattie McDaniel won the first one, then Sidney Poitier won one and Louis Gossett [Jr.],' ' Murphy said. (McDaniel won in 1940, Poitier in 1964 and Gossett in 1983.)
Murphy continued: 'I'll probably never win an Oscar for saying this but, hey, what the hey, I gotta say it. Actually, I might not be in any trouble because the way it's been going, every 20 years we get one, so we ain't due [till] about 2004 " so by then, this will have all blown over.'
His manager insisted he couldn't 'snub the academy,' so Murphy agreed to present the award, but added: 'I just want you to know that I'm gonna give this award, but black people will not ride the caboose of society, and we will not bring up the rear anymore. I want you to recognize us.' (Murphy would go on to receive a supporting actor Oscar nomination 19 years later for 'Dreamgirls,' but, as predicted, he has yet to win an Oscar).
Halle Berry won best actress in 2002 for 'Monster's Ball,' the first black woman to win in that category. While weeping onstage, she acknowledged her peers as well as the black women who had been nominated before her: 'This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened.'
Fifteen years later, Berry said 'that moment really meant nothing. It meant nothing. I thought it meant something, but I think it meant nothing.' No black woman has won best actress since.
Critics have often pointed out that when black actors do get nominated, it's usually for stereotypical roles such as servants, slaves or criminals. (As rapper Jadakiss put it, 'Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it?,' referring to the actor's Oscar win for playing a corrupt cop in 'Training Day.')
When Kim Basinger introduced a best picture nominee in 1990, she first highlighted a glaring omission: Spike Lee's scorching drama about racism and police brutality. 'We've got five great films here, and they're great, for one reason: because they tell the truth. But there is one film that's missing from this list, that deserves to be on it because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all, and that's 'Do the Right Thing.' '
'Driving Miss Daisy' won best picture that year. In it, Morgan Freeman played a black chauffeur to a wealthy, white, elderly woman; he'd later call the role 'a mistake,' leading him to be typecast in 'wise, old, dignified, black man' roles. (Lee wouldn't be nominated for best picture until 2019, when his 'BlacKkKlansman' lost to 'Green Book,' a divisive film about a poor, uneducated white man who chauffeurs a rich, acclaimed, black musician through the segregated South. 'Every time someone is driving somebody, I lose,' Lee said in the press room of the awards show.)
The conversation really kicked into high gear starting in 2015 when April Reign's #Oscars SoWhite tweet went viral. Mainstream media increasingly covered the glaring lack of diversity among nominees, drawing particular attention to the racial and ethnic makeup of the academy's voting body.
In 2016, only one nominee in the major acting and directing categories was not white. In the wake of the controversy, the academy announced major changes to its membership. Since then, the share of voting members who are people of color has doubled " to 16-percent.
Chris Rock tackled the #Oscars SoWhite controversy head-on when he hosted the 2016 ceremony. He also told a joke based on stereotypes of Asian kids being good at math; the academy later apologized for anything 'offensive' on the telecast.
But later during the broadcast, comedian Kevin Hart took to the stage to introduce a musical performance and said, 'I want to take a moment to applaud all of my actors and actresses of color that didn't get nominated tonight.'
'Tonight should not determine the hard work and effort you put into your craft. At the end of the day, we love what we do and we're breaking major ground doing it,' he said. 'These problems of today eventually will become problems of the old. Let's not let this negative issue of diversity beat us. Let's continue to do what we do best, and work hard.'
Four years later, and those remarks are still relevant. Awkwafina won the Golden Globe for lead actress in a comedy for 'The Farewell,' but the Lulu Wang film about a family returning to China to say goodbye to their beloved matriarch was shut out by the Oscars. 'Parasite,' the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, received six Oscar nominations but not a single acting nod (a troubling trend regarding movies with predominantly Asian casts). Lupita Nyong'o, who won a supporting actress Oscar for '12 Years a Slave' in 2014, was overlooked for her work in Jordan Peele's 'Us,' as was Jennifer Lopez for her acclaimed turn in 'Hust lers.'
That's plenty to inspire any presenter who wants to continue the long tradition of calling out the Oscars " at the Oscars.

Texto completo: After six full days of travel, Martin Luther King Jr. had finally arrived. He was met with wreaths of flowers and driven to a luxury hotel near the India Gate. He undoubtedly had jet lag, but before he could sleep it off, a news conference was set up in the lobby.
'To other countries I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim,' he told the two dozen reporters gathered there on Feb.-10, 1959.
They peppered him with questions. Was it true interracial marriage was illegal in the American South? Could nonviolent protests work in colonized Africa? Was he a vegetarian?
The Montgomery bus boycott three years earlier had been closely watched in Indian newspapers, particularly since King, as the young leader of the boycott, espoused the teachings of Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi. Now, he would be spending a month in India to learn more and pay homage to his hero.
King first learned about Gandhi as a seminary student in 1949, just a year after Gandhi had been assassinated. He soon wrote about Gandhi in his schoolwork as a person who 'greatly reveal[s] the working of the Spirit of God.'
Six years later, after the arrest of Rosa Parks, King led the 381-day boycott that would make him famous. Of the nonviolent direct-action technique, he said, 'Christ showed us the way, and Gandhi in India showed it could work.'
King had always hoped to visit India, but the civil rights movement kept him too busy for years. Finally, in 1959, a trip was organized and co-sponsored by the American Friends Service Committee and the Gandhi National Memorial Fund. His wife, Coretta Scott King, and biographer Lawrence D. Reddick joined him on the trip.
Everywhere they went, they were treated as honored guests, King later remembered. They had a jam-packed schedule throughout their stays in New Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta and Madras and had to turn down hundreds of invitations.
One of their first stops was to Gandhi's samadhi, or cremation site. King and his party laid a wreath of flowers. According to one observer, King was 'deeply moved' and knelt to pray for a long time.
He met with India's prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and vice president, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who had been close associates of Gandhi's during India's struggle for independence. Later, in her memoir, Coretta King said her husband compared it to 'meeting George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison in a single day.'
Martin Luther King Jr. met with many of Gandhi's friends and family members, who gave him their blessing to continue spreading Gandhian teachings. He visited Buddhist and Hindu temples and met with leaders of movements to redistribute land and eradicate the caste system.
He also gave lectures at several universities. In Bombay (now Mumbai), he had a particularly spirited discussion with African students who challenged him on whether nonviolence could be effective in the struggle against colonialism in Africa, according to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University.
'They felt that nonviolent resistance could only work in a situation where the resisters had a potential ally in the conscious of the opponent,' King later said. 'They, like many other students, tended to confuse passive resistance with non-resistance.'
Coretta King joined her husband at many of these talks. 'The Indian people love to listen to the Negro spirituals,' Martin Luther King Jr. wrote later in Ebony magazine. 'Therefore, Coretta ended up singing as much as I lectured.'
While in Bombay, King was also invited to stay at Gandhi's private residence. He wrote in the guest book, 'To have the opportunity of sleeping in the house where Gandhiji slept is an experience that I will never forget.' (Adding '-ji' to a name signifies reverence.)
Toward the end of the trip, one of his guides observed 'both the Kings (especially King himself) are JUST PLAIN EXHAUSTED.'
King gave a final news conference and radio address on March 9, the night before their departure, telling listeners he was leaving India 'more convinced than ever before that the method of nonviolent resistance is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for justice and human dignity.'
King had another news conference when he arrived back in New York City a few days later, but it doesn't appear to have been well attended; neither The Washington Post nor the New York Times mentioned it.
Four days later, he returned to the pulpit for a Palm Sunday service. He preached to his congregants about Gandhi's life and martyrdom, comparing him to Jesus and Abraham Lincoln. He told them " six years before the march from Selma to Montgomery " about the Salt March in 1930, when Gandhi led millions on a 218-mile nonviolent protest of an unjust law.
Hundreds were beaten by British authorities, with more than 60,000 arrested, but 'the British Empire knew, then, that this little man had mobilized the people of India to the point that they could never defeat them,' King said.
Jesus once said he had other sheep who 'were not of this fold,' King reminded the congregants, before concluding, 'It is one of the strange ironies of the modern world that the greatest Christian of the 20th century was not a member of the Christian church.'

ELECTION 2020; Warren puts her focus on gender; Democratic candidate makes an explicit appeal in final weeks before Iowa caucuses.

Texto completo: Three years after women flooded the streets of American cities to protest President Trump's election, two years since a record number of women ran for Congress and helped Democrats win control of the House, and one year after a record number of women decided to run for president, the Democratic Party is still embroiled in a debate about whether female candidates are up to the job of beating President Trump.
Just two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has been a front-runner but consistently dogged by doubts about her electability, has made gender a central element of her final campaign push.
Through most of the campaign year, Warren's message has been built mostly around class, not gender. But starting in the run-up to last week's televised debate in Iowa, she has increasingly pressed a gender-focused message.

It's a move that carries the hope of galvanizing female voters in a state where women have generally cast a significant majority of caucus votes. But it also brings considerable risk, highlighting the question of electability that has stalked her in a year in which Democratic voters are singularly focused on picking a candidate they believe can safely beat Trump.
Some voters cringe at party infighting.
"I don't think it's time to argue," said Lisa Beving, an undecided voter from Johnston, Iowa. "We have too much to lose."
Last week, in the debate, Warren confronted the electability question, arguing that the two women still running for president had a better record of electoral success than the men.
On Sunday, she received the endorsement of the highest-ranking woman in the Iowa Legislature. She met with Planned Parenthood activists in Des Moines on Friday and rallied her audience there to recognize the role women have played leading the resistance to Trump and winning control of the House.
"Women have come off the sidelines, women have stood up, women have said, 'I am not going to sit down and be quiet any longer,'" Warren said.
She and the other remaining woman in the race, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, got a boost Sunday with an unusual dual endorsement by the New York Times editorial board. The endorsement does not focus on the fact they are both women. But in their campaigns, neither has downplayed their gender.
Klobuchar has been blunt about sexism in the campaign, taking shots at former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., by saying a woman could never be so successful with such a thin resume. She makes jokes about her short height. She talks frequently about being a mom.
And Warren's campaign, even when she did not focus explicitly on gender, has been infused with her identity as a woman.
Her life story, the core of her stump speech, could be told only by a woman: She dropped out of college to get married, set her sights on being a teacher, lost jobs when she was pregnant. Her first policy proposal was about subsidizing child care, and she often tells the story about how she almost quit a job as a young mother because of the burdens of caring for a baby -- until her aunt came to the rescue.
When she meets young girls on the campaign trail she makes "pinky swear" promises and tells them, "I'm running for president because that's what girls do."
She has given four major campaign speeches built around the stories of accomplished, if often overlooked, women in history. She lauded Frances Perkins, the former Labor secretary under Franklin D. Roosevelt, in a New York City speech to more than 10,000 people; she hailed Phillis Wheatley, the first published black woman poet, in a New Year's Eve speech in Boston.
All along, Warren backers says, she has been hampered by voters who say she is the best candidate but they doubt a woman can beat Trump.
Taking that argument "head on" at last week's debate, Warren pointed out that she and Klobuchar were the only candidates on the stage who had been undefeated in their electoral history.
It was an attention-grabbing argument but was overshadowed by the clash between Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders over her claim that in a private 2018 conversation, he told her that he did not think a woman could beat Trump. He denied that, and after the debate, she refused to shake his hand.
In an exchange caught on tape, they each accused the other of calling them a liar.
The ice may be beginning to break. The two shook hands Monday when they met at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event in South Carolina. And they shared a light moment at a forum in Des Moines where presidential candidates were asked, among other more serious questions, about food preferences.
"We have a serious disagreement on Indian food," Sanders said to Warren as they crossed paths backstage, according to a video clip posted on Twitter.
The confrontation over gender politics carries special political risk in Iowa, where the caucus system gives candidates an incentive to appeal to voters for whom they might be a second choice.
Many Sanders supporters are furious at what they see as her backstabbing and questioning of Sanders' credibility. That could come into play because caucus-goers are sometimes called upon to back their second choice if their first falls short of a 15% viability threshold in their precinct.
"This fight with Bernie is not helping her," said one Iowa Democrat who has endorsed Warren. "There are a lot of precincts where she is viable and Bernie is not. Her ability to win over those folks is lessened."
But others say the intensified focus on gender could help Warren in the home stretch if it galvanizes women who are on the fence, especially those who have questions about Sanders' record on women. His 2016 campaign staff was hit by allegations of sexual harassment.
"It can become a really important part of her closing argument," said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic activist who is neutral in the primary race. "This is the opposite of what he wants the closing argument to be."
Sanders has stepped up his defense on women's issues. In an ad running in Iowa and New Hampshire, a female narrator says, "Bernie Sanders is on our side and always has been." This weekend, he picked up the endorsement of another influential woman in the party's progressive wing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington.
In a New Hampshire radio interview Saturday, Sanders continued to deny that he told Warren a woman couldn't beat Trump and stirred the pot again when asked whether "gender is still an obstacle for female politicians."
"The answer is yes," Sanders said. "But I think everybody has their own sets of problems. I'm 78 years of age. That's a problem."
Warren this weekend declined repeated opportunities to reengage in the fight with Sanders. At the Planned Parenthood event, Warren met an undecided voter who felt strongly about the episode.
"I believe you 100%," said Tanya Keith, 48, of Des Moines, who said she had post-traumatic stress from the battles between Sanders and the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016.
"I would like to know what your plans are for shutting him down, and when you're the nominee, winning his supporters over to your camp, because I feel like that was a mistake that we made in the Clinton camp, that we didn't mend those fences," Keith said.
Warren did not take the bait.
"Bernie and I have been friends for a long time. We fight for the same issues. We've been allies in these battles long before I ever got into politics," she said.
"That's all I want to say about that topic. Because what I truly believe is we're going to have to pull together."
The New York Times' endorsement of the two women remaining in the field was a bigger boost for Klobuchar, who has been struggling to make it into the top tier in Iowa in order to keep her candidacy alive, than for Warren, who would not have been a surprising choice for the liberal editorial page.
Janet Petersen, the state senator who just endorsed Warren, joked about the double choice at a town hall meeting Monday in Grimes, when talking about people in the audience who were still undecided.
"I get it. Even the New York Times gets it. They couldn't decide."
Notably, the endorsement made only one mention of the two endorsees' gender: In closing, the editorial said, "May the best woman win."

Procedures That Modify A Precedent From 1999

Texto completo: The Senate Republican leader proposed impeachment trial rules that push the 1999 precedent toward President Trump's preferences.
WASHINGTON -- For weeks, Senator Mitch McConnell sought to deflect charges that he was trying to stack the deck in favor of President Trump in his impeachment trial by repeating that he was merely replicating the Senate's only modern precedent: the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton.
"What was good enough for President Clinton in an impeachment trial should have been good enough for President Trump," he told reporters this month, as Democrats pressed him to include a new guarantee for witnesses and documents. "And all we are doing here is saying we are going to get started in exactly the same way that 100 senators agreed to 20 years ago."
But when Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, finally released a draft of his resolution on Monday evening, less than 24 hours before the Senate was expected to consider it, there were several meaningful differences from the rules that governed Mr. Clinton's impeachment, some of which were in line with Mr. Trump's preferences and his legal team's strategy.
The measure is expected to pass on Tuesday along party lines, over strenuous Democratic objections. Here is a look at the similarities and differences.
A trial running on fast-forward.
While Mr. McConnell proposes that the trial unfold in a similar sequence to the 1999 one -- opening statements, then questions from senators, then an up-or-down vote on whether to consider calling witnesses or new evidence -- his plan would speed up the proceedings.
Like in the Clinton trial, the Democratic House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense lawyers will have up to 24 hours to argue their respective cases for and against conviction on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But in 1999, the Senate imposed no additional limit on how the time was used. Mr. McConnell's proposal states that each side much complete its work within two days, beginning as early as Wednesday.
That means opening arguments could be finished by the end of this week, allowing the senators 16 hours for questioning and a subsequent debate early next week over whether to consider witness testimony. In the fastest possible scenario, the Senate could vote to convict or acquit by the end of January.
Aides for Mr. McConnell played down the differences, arguing that he had never meant to say the Trump rules would be identical to the Clinton ones, but would deal with opening arguments and consideration of witnesses in the same order.
But Senate Democrats were not pleased, and their leader, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, accused Mr. McConnell of trying to push the proceedings into "the wee hours of the night" to hide a damaging case against Mr. Trump. Mr. Schumer said he would offer a series of amendments on Tuesday "to address the many flaws in this deeply unfair proposal."
The White House, which has worked closely with Mr. McConnell on the trial's parameters, indicated it was pleased. Eric Ueland, the president's congressional liaison, said the team was "gratified that the draft resolution protects the president's rights to a fair trial."
The House's findings would not automatically be admitted into evidence.
When the Clinton trial opened, the Senate "admitted into evidence," printed and shared with senators all records generated by the House impeachment inquiry into Mr. Clinton. Not so this time.
Though the House's evidence from the Trump impeachment inquiry would still be printed and shared with senators, it would only be formally considered by the Senate as part of its official record if a majority of senators voted to do so. That vote could only take place after the Senate decided whether to call witnesses and seek additional documents -- that is, as the trial moves toward conclusion.
A senior Republican aide in the Senate said the change reflected a fundamental difference in the Clinton and Trump cases. In the Clinton case, the House's evidentiary record largely consisted of materials compiled by Ken Starr, the independent counsel.
This time, House Democrats conducted their impeachment inquiry entirely themselves, without the benefit of a Justice Department investigation. The aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail internal strategy, argued that in doing so, the House had denied Mr. Trump proper due process rights afforded to Mr. Clinton, suggesting the current president was not given a chance to contest the House's record.
The House invited Mr. Trump to mount a defense before the Judiciary Committee during its impeachment proceeding, including requesting witnesses and documents, but the president's legal team declined, saying it would not dignify an inquiry it deemed illegitimate with a response.
By not admitting the House impeachment inquiry's findings into evidence at the outset, Mr. McConnell, too, is in effect treating them as illegitimate.
As McConnell said, the resolution does not guarantee the trial will include witnesses.
As expected, the draft resolution does not incorporate Democratic demands that the trial guarantee witness testimony or requests for new documents. This was also the case in the Clinton trial, but Mr. McConnell's proposal still differs slightly.
It says that after senators conclude their questioning, they will not immediately entertain motions to call individual witnesses or documents. Instead, they will decide first whether they want to consider new evidence at all. Only if a majority of senators agree to do so will the managers and prosecutors be allowed to propose and argue for specific witnesses or documents, each of which would then be subject to an additional vote.
If a majority of the Senate ultimately did vote to call a witness for testimony, that witness would first be interviewed behind closed doors and then the "Senate shall decide after deposition which witnesses shall testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules," if any. Consistent with the Clinton trial rules, this essentially means that even if witnesses are called, they might never testify in public.
Democrats said Mr. McConnell's intentions were clear.
"Under this resolution, Senator McConnell is saying he doesn't want to hear any of the existing evidence, and he doesn't want to hear any new evidence," Mr. Schumer said. "It's a cover-up."
But Mr. McConnell appeared to have the votes he needed to move the resolution without Democrats. Minutes after the resolution was shared with reporters, a key moderate Republican who had been pushing the leader to ensure a vote on whether or not to call witnesses, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said he would be a yes.
And Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, another possible swing vote who favors calling witnesses, said the resolution met his requirements and tracked "closely with the rules package approved 100 to 0 during the Clinton trial."
What about a motion to dismiss the case?
Mr. McConnell's resolution does not include a guarantee that the Senate will vote on a motion to dismiss the case after opening arguments and senatorial questions rather than see the trial to its full conclusion. That guarantee was included in the Clinton-era rules in deference to Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a towering figure in the chamber at the time.
Individual senators or Mr. Trump's lawyers could still make a motion during the trial to force a dismissal vote -- an idea Mr. Trump has said he likes.
But Republican leaders believe doing so is unwise. With moderates committed to seeing the trial through, it risks dividing the party on a key vote, and in any case, they have argued it will be better for Mr. Trump in the long-run to have a Senate acquittal to his name.

Texto completo: Like Trump, India is pressuring both of Mr. Bezos' businesses as its leaders become more nationalistic toward foreign companies and news media.
MUMBAI, India -- Jeff Bezos' ownership of The Washington Post has complicated business for his much bigger company, Amazon, in Trump-era Washington.
Now the same thing could be happening in New Delhi under India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, who has increasingly sought to rein in both the international news media and foreign technology companies.
Last week, a senior official of Mr. Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party criticized The Post's coverage of the country during a visit by Mr. Bezos to announce new investments in India, one of Amazon's fastest-growing markets.
The official, Vijay Chauthaiwale, urged Mr. Bezos to return to Washington and "impart some wisdom" to Post employees about the bright prospects for India that Mr. Bezos was touting in New Delhi.
"Otherwise your charm offensive is likely to be waste of time and money," Mr. Chauthaiwale wrote in a tweet on Thursday.
On the same day, Mr. Modi's commerce minister, Piyush Goyal, dismissed Mr. Bezos' announcement of a fresh $ 1 billion investment to help small businesses in the country. "It is not as if they are doing a favor to India," Mr. Goyal told reporters. He then referred to the antitrust investigation of Amazon and its chief rival that Indian regulators opened the day before Mr. Bezos arrived.
Although both men later tempered their remarks, the double-barreled assault on The Post and Amazon is reminiscent of President Trump, who has repeatedly attacked Mr. Bezos, The Post's coverage of his administration, and Amazon -- often all in the same tweet.
Amazon filed a lawsuit against the United States government late last year, arguing that a multibillion-dollar federal contract for cloud services had been awarded to Microsoft because of Mr. Trump's personal animus toward Mr. Bezos. The Trump administration has denied that the president's feelings influenced the decision.
A Washington Post opinion editor, Eli Lopez, responded to Mr. Chauthaiwale's comments on Twitter: "Just to clarify: Jeff Bezos doesn't tell Washington Post journalists what to write. Independent journalism is not about charming governments. But there's no question the work of our correspondents and columnists fits within India's democratic traditions."
An Amazon spokeswoman in India declined to comment.
In an interview, Mr. Chauthaiwale said that India was not trying to link its policies toward Amazon with concerns about The Post's news coverage. "I don't think the Indian government will do these things," he said. "We also know that business is different from journalism."
But he said that The Post's coverage of India, particularly in its opinion pages, had been unfairly biased against the government. "The Washington Post does not want to give its readers both parts of the narrative," he said.
The Post said in a statement that it had "covered India fairly and accurately, even when the government has imposed tight restrictions on the flow of information, as it did with Kashmir." The news organization added that its Opinion department published a variety of viewpoints from India and around the world.
Over the past year and a half, the Modi government and its B.J.P. allies have grown increasingly strident in their criticism of foreign news media. That criticism swelled into a cacophony over international news coverage of the government's decision in August to strip away the statehood of the predominantly Muslim region of Jammu and Kashmir, send in troops, shut down the internet and arrest community leaders and opposition politicians.
The Post and other news outlets, including The New York Times, published numerous reports contradicting the government's claims that all was peaceful and normal in Kashmir.
In response, senior officials like the external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, have complained in Washington and New York about the reporting. Mr. Jaishankar also canceled a meeting with members of the United States Congress after leaders refused to exclude Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, who has sponsored a resolution urging the Modi government to lift restrictions in Kashmir.
In India, the government has increased limits on foreign news outlets, including shortening the duration of journalists' visas and preventing them from going to Kashmir and to Assam, the center of a fight over a new citizenship law that is perceived as anti-Muslim.
In the realm of business, the government has also taken a nationalistic approach, seeking to rein in the power of foreign technology giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce site purchased by Walmart in 2018.
Some business leaders see the effort as counterproductive as India struggles to reverse a deepening economic slump and rising inflation.
Others suggested that the rhetoric is tougher in public than in private.
"I've been in touch with our member companies," said Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, a business group whose members include PepsiCo, Cisco, Mastercard, Boeing and Disney. "Over all, we are not experiencing any change in sentiment with regard to investment in India."
Mr. Aghi said that the United States and India were working to improve their relationship, with the hope that Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi could sign a long-awaited trade deal during a possible visit by the American president to India at the end of February.
"There will be positive changes for U.S. companies in India," Mr. Aghi said.

Texto completo: Since 1851, when the standard was set at 98.6 Fahrenheit, the average human body temperature has steadily declined.
We seem to be getting cooler. Since 1851, when the standard was set at 37 degrees centigrade, or 98.6 Fahrenheit, the average human body temperature has steadily declined.
Researchers studied three databases: 23,710 readings obtained between 1862 and 1930 in veterans of the Civil War; 15,301 records in a national health survey from 1971 to 1975; and 150,280 entries in a Stanford University database from 2007 to 2017. The analysis is in eLife.
Over all, average body temperature decreased by 0.03 degrees centigrade, or about 0.05 degrees Fahrenheit, per birth decade.
Differences in measurement techniques and equipment do not explain the effect. The decline was evident even within each database, year by year, and the drop between the two modern databases, when equipment and techniques were presumably the same, was identical.
Why this is happening is unclear, but the scientists suggest that improvements in sanitation and improved dental and medical care have reduced chronic inflammation, and the constant temperatures maintained by modern heating and air conditioning have helped lower resting metabolic rates. Today, a temperature of 97.5 may be closer to "normal" than the traditional 98.6.
"We've looked at the U.S.," said the senior author, Dr. Julie Parsonnet, a professor of medicine at Stanford, "and we have to see if this holds true elsewhere. We're evolving physiologically. But what does it really mean? I don't know. I haven't figured out exactly how to look at that."

Texto completo: Isabel dos Santos, Africa's richest woman and the daughter of Angola's former president, is under scrutiny by her bank and the Angolan government after a leak of more than 700,000 documents showed how she exploited the country's wealth to enrich herself.
EuroBic, a Lisbon-based arm of a bank where Ms. dos Santos is the biggest shareholder, said on Monday that it was ending its "commercial relationship" with her and investigating transfers worth tens of millions of dollars, transactions that were revealed on Sunday by The New York Times and other news outlets working with the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.
Angola's attorney general said on Monday that the government would "use all possible means" to bring Ms. dos Santos back to the country, where she faces possible corruption charges and where her assets were frozen last month, along with her husband's and those of a Portuguese business associate, Agence France-Presse reported. The Angolan government, led until September 2017 by her father, José Eduardo dos Santos, said the three were responsible for more than $ 1 billion in lost government money.
The leaked documents, which include emails, invoices, slide presentations and contracts, provided a paper trail showing how Ms. dos Santos and her husband, Sindika Dokolo, amassed a fortune of more than $ 2 billion through their stakes in vital Angolan industries like telecommunications, diamonds and construction. Angola, rich in oil and diamonds, is nevertheless impoverished, with one of the world's highest infant mortality rates and endemic corruption.
The leaked materials also revealed that in November 2017, when Ms. dos Santos was chairwoman of Angola's state oil company, Sonangol, more than $ 57 million was transferred from that company to the bank account of a Dubai company owned by a friend of hers. Ms. dos Santos has said the money was for fees owed to consultants and accountants, including Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey & Company and PwC, formerly called PricewaterhouseCoopers. It is not clear whether that sum matched bills from the consultants; the companies declined to provide billing details, citing client confidentiality. About $ 38 million was transferred in the hours after Angola's new president at the time -- her father's successor -- announced on Nov. 15, 2017, that she was being fired from Sonangol, the documents show.
Those transfers drained Sonangol's account at EuroBic, the European arm of an Angolan bank where Ms. dos Santos owns a 42.5 percent stake. In EuroBic's statement on Monday, cutting commercial ties with Ms. dos Santos and associates of hers, the bank said it would audit the November 2017 transfers and report its findings to Portugal's central bank.
EuroBic's headquarters, steps from Ms. dos Santos's sprawling Lisbon apartment, plays a central role in her business empire, which encompasses more than 400 companies and subsidiaries. Most global banks, bound by tough reporting requirements on doing business with so-called politically exposed persons, have avoided doing business with her. EuroBic, though bound by the same rules, continued to do extensive business with Ms. dos Santos and her husband, the documents show.
Ms. dos Santos didn't immediately respond to questions about EuroBic's announcement that were emailed Monday evening to her London law firm.
But she made her position on the leaked documents clear on Sunday, when news organizations around the world simultaneously published their investigations -- the work of more than 120 reporters in 20 countries, who spent months analyzing the documents and interviewing hundreds of people in Angola, Portugal and other countries where she has had business interests.
"The ICIJ report is based on many fake documents and false information, it is a coordinated political attack in coordinations with the 'Angolan Government,"' Ms. dos Santos wrote on Twitter. "715 thousand documents read? Who believes that?"

Texto completo: Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
For at least 10 years, which is how long I've been reporting on privacy, people have worried about a facial recognition app that could end anonymity.
I joined The New York Times as a technology reporter in July, but back in 2011, when I was reporting for Forbes Magazine, I attended a workshop at the Federal Trade Commission, where attendees discussed the rules that should govern the commercial development of facial recognition. Everyone agreed that companies should not make an application that could identify anyone at anytime.
"A mobile app that could, in real-time, identify anonymous individuals on the street or in a bar could cause serious privacy and physical safety concerns," the commission said in a report that came out after the workshop.
In November, I found out that an app capable of doing what many had feared did exist. A small, little-known company called Clearview AI, which I wrote about in a front-page article, had scraped the open web, collected billions of photos of people, and made an app that could show you all the images it had of a person, along with links to the sites where they came from. It was equal parts desirable and terrifying: technology that could put a name to a face in seconds and dig up photos of you online that you didn't know existed. But only law enforcement agencies seemed to know about and be using it.
I wanted to learn as much as I could about Clearview AI, including who was behind it and how the app worked, to help readers understand this groundbreaking tool.
I was tipped off to the company's existence by Freddy Martinez, a researcher for Open the Government, a nonprofit focused on government transparency, and Beryl Lipton, who works for MuckRock, a nonprofit news organization that helps people file public records requests. Last year, when they requested public records from 112 police departments about their use of facial recognition, a few departments gave them invoices and marketing materials for Clearview AI. Clearview stuck out because it claimed to be scraping social media sites and the open web instead of using mugshots or D.M.V. photos, as was the norm with the other vendors.
Mr. Martinez has been doing research for years on how law enforcement uses technology. I had previously used documents unearthed by an organization he founded for a story in 2018 on the unregulated practice of undercover police officers friending people on Facebook. Mr. Martinez sent me an email in mid-November about Clearview, saying it "appears to be crossing the Rubicon on facial recognition technology" and provided relevant documents received from police departments.
First, I went to Clearview's website, but it was a bare-bones landing page with a "Request Access" button. (I requested access but never got it.) The website listed an office address, a few blocks from The Times building in Midtown Manhattan. I walked over, but the address didn't exist. (The company later told me it was a typo.) Business filings that my colleague, Kitty Bennett, found listed an address for a building on the Upper West Side. When I went there, a doorman told me it was someone's home and wouldn't let me go up.
These red flags initially suggested that the technology could be fake, but police officers using the app said that wasn't the case. (I reached out to the police departments that had turned over public records about Clearview as well as those that had Clearview AI as a line-item on their public municipal budgets.) Detectives in Florida, Texas and Georgia said it worked incredibly well and had helped them solve dozens of cases in just the few short months they had been using it. I wanted to see for myself how well it worked, so I asked a few officers if they would run my photo through the app and show me the results.
And that's when things got kooky. The officers said there were no results -- which seemed strange because I have a lot of photos online -- and later told me that the company called them after they ran my photo to tell them they shouldn't speak to the media. The company wasn't talking to me, but it was tracking who I was talking to.
After a month of being ignored, I decided to knock on more doors. A venture capital firm in Bronxville, N.Y., listed Clearview as one of its investments. The firm hadn't returned my emails or phone calls so I took a 40-minute train ride from Manhattan to its office, and with a reporter on the doorstep, they finally agreed to answer some questions.
That same week, I received a call from Lisa Linden, who identifies herself online as a "veteran crisis communications strategist." She told me she was now representing Clearview AI. She set up an interview with the company's founder, Hoan Ton-That, and connected me with proponents of the app.
At the same time, as reporting continued, my colleagues shared their expertise. Investigative reporters at The Times helped map the company's footprint by reaching out to their law enforcement sources. Metro reporters offered contacts to flush out the company's background in New York. And an interactive news journalist did a forensic analysis of the company's app to discover code that revealed the ability to pair it with augmented reality glasses.
As a relative newcomer to The Times, it was incredible to see the resources in this newsroom, and to use them to reveal a company that wants to unmask us all.

Texto completo: The silly superheroes of "Legends" are back for a fifth season, and the British crime series "Vera" returns on BritBox.
What's on TV
DC'S LEGENDS OF TOMORROW 9 p.m. on the CW. After defeating a group of monsters and magical creatures that had been released from hell last season -- using odd methods, like singing James Taylor songs -- the Legends have become a worldwide phenomenon. In this Season 5 premiere, they invite a documentary crew to film them as they look into a new blip in the timeline, but Sara (Caity Lotz) is not happy with the attention.
PROJECT BLUE BOOK 10 p.m. on History. Aidan Gillen ("Game of Thrones") stars in this drama series about an Air Force program set up to debunk cases involving unidentified flying objects in the 1950s and '60s. Gillen plays Allen Hynek, a professor who can't simply dismiss inexplicable events, despite pressure from the government to do so. Season 2 opens with Hynek and Capt.

FORTUNE FEIMSTER: SWEET & SALTY (2020) Stream on Netflix. The comedian and actress Fortune Feimster ("The Mindy Project," "The L Word: Generation Q") takes the stage in Charlotte, N.C., for her first hourlong Netflix special. Feimster riffs on her childhood and draws laughs through plenty of self-deprecating anecdotes: She has been mistaken for the actor Patrick Renna, who starred in "The Sandlot," and she lived through an excruciating, failed attempt to become a swim champion as a child.
VERA Stream on BritBox. This popular British crime series returns for a 10th season -- and it has already been renewed for an 11th. Brenda Blethyn stars as Vera Stanhope, a veteran detective chief inspector who is a little rough around the edges and, like most TV sleuths, obsessed with her work. The series, based on the crime novels by Ann Cleeves, is ripe for binge-watching: The four-part season looks at cases that touch on corporate corruption and organized crime, starting with the mysterious death of an entrepreneur whose body is found by bailiffs trying to repossess his house.
MISS SLOANE (2016) Stream on Amazon; rent on Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Jessica Chastain plays a ruthless Washington lobbyist in this political thriller directed by John Madden. Elizabeth is always one step ahead of her opponents, and she cannot be bothered by ethics. But she does have one principle that comes to light when an organization asks her to make gun ownership more appealing to women. The film's ending disappointed some critics, yet over all the movie received positive reviews, mainly for Chastain's performance. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said she stars "with such steely authority that you are hard pressed to imagine another actress playing the imperious, largely unsympathetic title character."

Texto completo: Almost as quickly as McGregor dropped Donald Cerrone at U.F.C. 246, opponents lined up to be the next to face the Irish superstar.
LAS VEGAS -- Medical staff had barely begun wiping the blood from Donald Cerrone's busted nose when other fighters started making it known they want to face Conor McGregor, who beat Cerrone in 40 seconds in the main event at U.F.C. 246.
Some of those who want the next shot served notice on Twitter.
"Weak," veteran U.F.C. fighter Nate Diaz tweeted with an expletive, implying that, if given a third fight with McGregor, he would perform better than Cerrone had.
The rugged welterweight contender Jorge Masvidal sat prominently near the octagon at T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night, after telling reporters earlier in the week that he would rather face the Irish star McGregor than fight for a world title.
"Saw what I needed to see," Masvidal tweeted Sunday, hinting that he had spotted flaws in McGregor's performance that he could exploit.
And on Instagram, boxers Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao each posted about the fight, with Mayweather uploading a fight poster featuring himself pictured alongside the 31-year-old McGregor, touting a hypothetical rematch this year.
Whether or not those fighters believe they can beat McGregor, they know they can make significant money facing him. Cerrone earned a career-high $ 200,000 for his loss, and the brief bout generated $ 11.1 million in ticket sales, the second-best figure ever for a mixed martial arts event in Nevada.
If McGregor, who returned Saturday night after a 15-month layoff, can stay in the octagon and out of legal trouble, he gives the U.F.C. a bankable star with mainstream profile, and gives fighters in two sports a chance at career-defining paydays.
McGregor's win over Cerrone gives him options more than three years after he became the simultaneous champion of two divisions.
"I'm going to have a look at the calendar and see where we're at," McGregor said after the fight on Saturday. "I'll be ready."
McGregor suggested that he could return as quickly as March 7, for U.F.C. 248 in Las Vegas, and he told reporters that he planned to resume training on Monday.
Before Saturday, McGregor had last competed in October 2018, when he was neck-cranked into submission by Russian wrestling ace Khabib Nurmagomedov in a championship grudge match that ignited a post-fight brawl. The melee earned McGregor a fine and a six-month suspension from Nevada regulators, and the fighter's time off featured a series of legal issues. McGregor pleaded guilty to smashing a tourist's camera in Miami, and to punching a bar patron in Ireland.
During fight week, McGregor and his backers at the U.F.C. unveiled a rebranded version of the fighter's persona. The trash-talking heel who grew into the promotion's biggest star renewed himself as a congenial sportsman who, with most of his legal issues settled, could focus on becoming the best fighter possible.
In the octagon, McGregor appeared to be the same fast, accurate striker who won titles in two weight classes, even if he opened the fight by missing Cerrone with a wild left hand.
"Fifteen months outside of the octagon, a little eager," McGregor said.
From there, he overwhelmed the 36-year-old Cerrone, knocking him woozy with a left-footed kick to the jaw, burying him with a barrage of punches, and prompting a massive ovation from the 19,040 spectators who packed T-Mobile Arena.
The near-sellout indicated that McGregor's time off didn't damage his ability to sell tickets, and the U.F.C. had already bet on McGregor's marketability by guaranteeing him $ 3 million for the Cerrone bout. He will receive an undisclosed portion of the event's pay-per-view revenue, and earned a $ 50,000 bonus for his spectacular knockout.
While McGregor's initial payout was the largest on Saturday's card -- everyone else's guarantees totaled just under $ 1.5 million -- it was far less than the $ 30 million he made up front for his 2017 boxing match with Mayweather. Those dollar figures help explain why, when questioned about McGregor's future bouts, U.F.C. president Dana White focused on fights with mainstream appeal, and the potential to break revenue records.
He acknowledged that boxing matches with Mayweather, who is retired, and Pacquiao, who is still active, remain long shots. But White said Saturday that a rematch between McGregor and the undefeated Nurmagomedov could fill football stadiums. He mentioned AT&T Stadium in Dallas and London's O2 arena among several potential destinations for that bout.
"This is a massive fight with global appeal," White said.
First, Nurmagomedov is scheduled to defend his 155-pound title against Tony Ferguson at U.F.C. 249 this April at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.
White's long-term plans for McGregor depend on the fighter staying healthy -- he suffered no apparent injuries in his 40-second win over Cerrone.
They also require the fighter to stay out of trouble. McGregor was silent on Wednesday when asked directly about two sexual assault investigations in his home country of Ireland, though he told ESPN in response to a general question about "allegations" that he denied them and that "time will reveal all." The New York Times reported on Wednesday that he had not been charged, and the existence of the investigations does not imply that McGregor is guilty of any crime.
Through a publicist, McGregor has denied the allegations, and he maintained during fight week that he no longer faces any legal obstacles.
McGregor gives the U.F.C. a top-of-the-roster star who can reach mainstream audiences, and his return to the U.F.C.'s regular rotation is likely to provide a timely boost in viewership to the fight promotion.
Last year the U.F.C. entered a deal with ESPN, migrating their online video streaming service to the ESPN+ streaming platform, and putting their U.S. pay-per-view business online. Partnering with ESPN gives the U.F.C. a steady presence among mainstream sports fans -- the network sent a "SportsCenter" crew to Las Vegas, and integrated fight-week content into its regular programming.
"If you had to pay for what ESPN did for the promotion of this fight, what would that number be?" White asked after the fight. "It's a massive number."

Texto completo: Readers react to The Times's unusual decision to endorse two candidates.
To the Editor:
Re "Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren Are Democrats' Top Choices for President" (editorial, Jan. 20):
As a potential Democratic primary voter, I don't have the luxury of the two-choice option settled on by The Times. As the editorial predicted, there will be "those dissatisfied" with The Times's decision. I'm in that category.
The policy differences between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar are stark and not fungible, and a choice requires reasoned decision making. Both women are smart, experienced public servants, and when it comes to character, either of them totally outshines the current president by a landslide. But policy notwithstanding, the ultimate criterion for the Democratic candidate must be electability. The Trump scourge, for the good of the country, must be eliminated.
In that regard, Ms. Klobuchar has a decided edge. Your editorial describes her bipartisan accomplishments -- not flashy but "meaningful." Her Midwestern roots, electoral success, basic likability and apparent solidity are assets that can more easily morph into electability in the vital swing states.
Ms. Warren, while admirably passionate about her policies, nonetheless appears unduly rigid and unlikely to expand her base. The Times should have endorsed Ms. Klobuchar over Ms. Warren.

To the Editor:
Having read all the interviews with the Democratic candidates currently leading in the polls, I was amazed to see The Times's editorial staff so thoughtfully navigate the complexity of choosing among them for an endorsement.
While many may see your unwillingness to endorse a single candidate as a deflection, your deference to these two particular candidates has given us a road map for not one but two ways out of the wilderness in which we find ourselves. That road map also clearly challenges us to have that long-awaited debate about who we are as a nation and decide where we are going.
David Simpson
Rindge, N.H.
To the Editor:
Not since the Civil War has America faced such a crisis. The very essence of America is at stake. Nothing is more important than defeating Donald Trump in November. How disappointing to see The Times endorse two individuals who have far less chance to defeat Mr. Trump than former Vice President Joe Biden. The Times has assisted Mr. Trump in his re-election bid. Even worse, you punted. You picked two!

To the Editor:
Televising the editorial board's Democratic primary endorsement decision on "The Weekly" on Sunday night turned out to be eye-opening -- in all the wrong ways. From immaterial questions ("Who broke your heart?," apparently asked of each candidate, and cruelly asked of Joe Biden) to the silly high school canvass of votes ("Write down your top two!"), the show had all the gravitas of bad reality TV. There was scant insight for those of us still deciding between Democrats.
Next time, please spare us the view of the sausage making and make a damn choice.
Kristin Huckshorn
Boca Raton, Fla.
To the Editor:
I've been reading the transcripts of the interviews that the editorial board conducted with several of the major Democratic candidates for president. Until your interview with Pete Buttigieg, they were, for the most part, friendly and collegial. The interview with Mr. Buttigieg, which started with his stint at McKinsey & Company, was so hostile that it took my breath away. You would have thought his joining McKinsey as an entry-level employee was the equivalent of his traveling off to Syria to join ISIS.
Donald Lubin
Greenwich, N.J.
To the Editor:
Bravo! Great job! You bucked tradition and, as far as I'm concerned, you nailed it. I could feel the editorial board's passion about this election and the need for change in the explanation of why you made your choices. Yes! May the best woman win.
Michele Postal
Eugene, Ore.
To the Editor:
After reading your Feb. 23 article "Klobuchar's Taunts and Temper Stand Out in Sea of Tough Bosses," I cannot agree with your endorsement. This describes a fatal flaw in her personality. Can you imagine her in high-level meetings berating people who displease or disagree with her? If she cannot even handle her aides diplomatically, she should not lead the nation. We do not need this after what we have been through with President Trump.
I fear that your desire for a woman president has swayed your decision.
Steve Gill
Port Ludlow, Wash.
To the Editor:
As a strong supporter of Senator Elizabeth Warren, I suppose I should be unconditionally delighted that she shares in your endorsement for the Democratic nomination. But I am concerned that you have described the race as one between a radical and a realist.
The Democrats offer a choice between centrists with realistic goals and progressives with realistic goals. Ms. Warren has the clearest plans for accomplishing hers, as you noted. Each will have an easier time accomplishing these if Democrats win more Senate seats; each is likely to encounter problems along the way; each will take us toward a better world.
Senator Amy Klobuchar has tried to make the case that she is a realist in a world of extremists -- Donald Trump on the one hand, Ms. Warren and Bernie Sanders on the other -- setting up a bizarre false equivalency. There is nothing unrealistic about Ms. Warren or her plans.
Davi Napoleon
Ann Arbor, Mich.
To the Editor:
Thank you for laying out the case for Amy Klobuchar. I'm only sorry that you included Elizabeth Warren in the endorsement. If Ms. Warren is the nominee, there will be a similar issue that Hillary Clinton had with Bernie Sanders supporters. Mr. Sanders, I believe, was a factor in Mrs. Clinton's loss. The Warren and Sanders camps are needed for a Democratic victory and will unite only if some other candidate wins the primary contest.
Amy Klobuchar with Cory Booker as her vice president would be the ideal combination for speaking to and rallying African-American and Midwest constituents. May it be so.
Elizabeth Bjorkman
Lexington, Mass.
To the Editor:
The editorial board has defied its mission by endorsing both Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar. As The Times has stated, the editorial board differs from the newsroom in that the newsroom describes the world as it is and the editorial board describes the world as it should be. At this moment in history rife with division, the public did not need a mirror on its collective confusion but rather a clear and concise vision for what a Democratic nominee should be.
By endorsing two candidates, however, the editorial board has endorsed no one. The moderate/liberal pair could just have easily been Biden/Sanders. Choosing the two female candidates to "split the spotlight" rings of sexism and makes this lukewarm endorsement even that much more disappointing.
Lisa Glahn
Marblehead, Mass.
To the Editor:
Thank you for your work in publishing interviews with Democratic candidates and for your endorsement editorial. Both are thought-provoking and valuable contributions to the selection of presidential candidates.
However, rather than simply conceding that Donald Trump "will nearly certainly coast to the nomination," it would also be useful to hear about William Weld's background, qualifications and policy positions. He deserves enormous credit for having the rare courage to challenge Mr. Trump from within the party and should be heard for that reason alone. And Republicans need to know that they have within their ranks at least one good alternative to four more years of the mayhem we've seen from the current administration.
Frederick W. Deichmann
Mystic, Conn.
To the Editor:
If the brilliant and exceedingly well-informed members of the Times editorial board cannot make up their mind whom to vote for, what hope is there for the typical voter?

Texto completo: The other day a correspondent asked me a good question: What important issue aren’t we talking about? My answer, after some reflection, is the state of America’s children.
Now, it’s not entirely fair to say that we’re ignoring the plight of our children. Elizabeth Warren, characteristically, has laid out a comprehensive, fully financed plan for universal child care. Bernie Sanders, also characteristically, says he’s for it but hasn’t provided details. And as far as I can tell, all the other Democratic presidential candidates support doing more for children.
But policy toward children has attracted far less media attention than the debate over “Medicare for All,” which won’t become reality anytime soon — let alone the so-called Warren-Sanders “spat.”
And my guess is that even well-informed voters have little sense of the grim exceptionalism of America’s child-oriented policies, which are Dickensian compared with those of every other advanced country.
A few numbers may be in order here.
Every advanced country mandates some form of paid leave for new mothers, typically three or four months — every country, that is, except the United States, which offers no maternity leave at all.
Most advanced countries devote substantial sums to benefits for families with children; in Europe these benefits average between 2% and 3% percent of gross domestic product. The corresponding number for the United States is 0.6% of GDP.
Even where the United States does help children, the quality of that help tends to be poor. French schoolchildren are taught to eat healthy meals; American children are basically treated as a disposal site for farm surpluses.
Why?
The answer, I’d suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can’t vote. These days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white.
But even before immigration transformed the U.S. ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.
This perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in U.S. inner cities.
At this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong.
Sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused not by culture but by the disappearance of good jobs.
And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the U.S. heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.
Multiple studies have found that children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.
Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, I hope he or she will give our nation’s shameful treatment of children the attention it deserves.

THE STATE OF HEALTH DISPARITIES: In recent years, many of the leading narratives about health and mortality have centered on reports of falling life expectancies among middle-aged whites. Yet the stark reality is that blacks still die at a younger age than whites, have disproportionately worse health outcomes, and are less likely to have access to care.
Those realities are shaped by what are referred to in public health as the “social determinants of health,” meaning aspects of life that affect overall wellness, from access to jobs and education to housing and transportation. In other words, where and how people live helps determine how healthy and how long their lives will be.
Factors such as racism and economic burdens can lead to “toxic stress,” according to the advocacy group Mental Health America, contributing to chronic diseases, substance abuse, and depression.
There have been a few areas of improvement, but the differences in health outcomes are still pronounced when comparing black Americans with white Americans. On Martin Luther King Day, here is a brief picture of health disparities in America, using the most recently available data for each category:
* The rates of uninsured are still higher among Latinos and blacks than they are among whites, even though rates of uninsured fell across all races following Obamacare.

TRUMP ANGRY AT AZAR OVER HEALTHCARE: The president berated his Health and Human Services secretary over high drug prices and polling showing that voters trusted Democrats more than Republicans to handle healthcare, according to multiple reports. He particularly wants to see Alex Azar take swift action on letting states import prescription drugs from Canada, a proposal that is tied up in rulemaking.
Trump regrets getting involved with vaping: "I should never have done that f---ing vaping thing," President Trump said, according to Axios.
CDC BACKS OFF WARNING AGAINST ALL TYPES OF VAPING: After about six months of warning against all forms of vaping, including nicotine e-cigarettes, the CDC has narrowed the broad warning down to recommending that people mostly stay away from vaping THC, the psychoactive chemical in marijuana.
OBAMACARE BIRTH CONTROL MANDATE TO GO BACK BEFORE SCOTUS: The Supreme Court review the legality of a Trump administration rule that allows employers to opt out of covering birth control for their workers when they have religious or moral objections.
The case consolidates two challenges, Trump v. Pennsylvania and Little Sisters of the Poor Saints Peter and Paul Home v. Pennsylvania. The rules were blocked by lower courts, and the hearing will mark the third time that the birth control mandate will come up before the Supreme Court.
NEW MEDICAID BLOCK GRANT GUIDANCE IS IMMINENT: The Trump administration will release new guidance for granting states waivers to use Medicaid block grants, according to the Wall Street Journal. Democrats Frank Pallone and Ron Wyden have warned the agencies that the waivers would be “illegal” and said that issuing them would be part of the administration’s “ongoing effort to fundamentally alter and weaken Medicaid’s financing structure.”
USDA MIGHT ROLL BACK MICHELLE OBAMA’S HEALTHY SCHOOL LUNCH POLICY: The U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed throwing out requirements for healthier school lunches, requirements championed by former First Lady Michelle Obama. The USDA Food and Nutrition Service plans to introduce more “flexibility” for schools to create their own meal plans, which could mean adjusting and scaling back the required serving sizes for fruits and vegetables. The FNS said the proposal would be a means to reduce food waste, as kids tend to throw away the foods they don’t eat, such as vegetables.
BIDEN WALKS BACK HIS PROMISE THAT YOU CAN KEEP PRIVATE INSURANCE IF YOU LIKE IT: Presidential candidate Joe Biden walked back a July 2019 promise that if you like your private insurance plan, you can keep it under his public option insurance plan. When asked about the July promise, he told the New York Times editorial board in an interview published Friday that what he meant in July was that if an employer continues providing private insurance plans to his or her workers, those workers can stay in those private plans. However, if the employer cancels the private coverage, workers would automatically be enrolled in a Medicare-like program under Biden’s public option system.
MAJOR AIRPORTS START SCREENING FOR NEW VIRUS SWEEPING CHINA: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Homeland Security have begun screening travelers from Wuhan, China, at some of the busiest airports in the U.S. — San Francisco, Los Angeles, and John F. Kennedy in New York — for a mystery pneumonia-like illness that has infected 198 people in Wuhan. Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore airports initiated screening procedures Dec. 31, and the virus has also spread to Japan, Thailand, and Beijing. So far, more than 200 people have gotten sick and three have died.
FORMER GOP CONGRESSMAN SENTENCED OVER TWO YEARS FOR INSIDER TRADING: Former GOP congressman Chris Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison and made to pay a $200,000 fine for tipping his son off to confidential information about an Australian biotech company’s failed drug trial. Cameron Collins, the congressman’s son, as well as his co-conspirator, Stephen Zarsky, were able to dump their stocks well before the news about the failed prescription drug trial was made public, and avoided hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses. Collins, one of Trump’s first supporters for president, resigned from his congressional seat Sept. 30 and pleaded guilty the next day to securities fraud.

Texto completo: Joe Biden has reason to be confident of his chances in the Iowa caucuses, according to a new poll.
Two weeks out from the first-in-the-nation contest on Feb. 3, Biden, 77, is the preferred 2020 Democratic presidential nominee for 24% of likely caucusgoers, a Focus on Rural America survey released Monday found.
While the former vice president's support softened by a single percentage since the rural advocacy group last conducted the poll in September, he still has a 6-point advantage on his nearest rival, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, well outside the margin of error. The Massachusetts senator, 70, earns 8% of the vote, slipping by 5 percentage points since the fall — the most drastic decline of the crowded primary field.
The public opinion research, undertaken after Warren accused Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont of doubting whether a woman could win the White House, reported former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg in third place with 16% support, a boost of 4 percentage points from last year. Sanders rounded out the top tier of contenders with 14%, up 5 percentage points.
Biden was also Iowa Democrats' most preferred second candidate, ahead of Buttigieg, Warren, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Sanders among likely caucusgoers who would back another presidential hopeful if their favorite didn't reach the 15% viability threshold needed to gain delegates.
Klobuchar, who notched up an extra 3 percentage points from September for 11% of the vote, was the candidate named "best for the needs and interests of rural Iowa." Warren, Sanders, Biden, and Buttigieg trailed the Midwesterner for the honor, bestowed on her following the New York Times endorsing both her and Warren.
[Related: New York Times says Biden and Sanders are too old to be president]
Although Biden is in front in this study, it represents only a snapshot of a competitive, fluid race for the right to challenge President Trump in the general election. According to the Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll released earlier this month, Sanders is the preferred White House hopeful for 20% of likely caucusgoers. Warren is No. 2 with 17%, Buttigieg has 16%, and Biden is at 15%.
Pollsters for Focus on Rural America, founded by former Iowa Lt. Gov. Patty Judge and Democratic strategist Jeff Link, surveyed 500 likely 2020 caucusgoers using cell phones and landlines between Jan. 15 and Jan. 18. Their results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.

The New York Times produces The Apprentice: White House Edition

Texto completo: In reality television, contenders fear nothing more than receiving what's known as a bad edit. Producers understand that villains aren't brought to set; they're made by clip selections and stunts on set designed to provoke a particular kind of footage.
And in the New York Times's very own reality TV spot, Pete Buttigieg got the bad edit.
Mayor Pete is polling fourth nationally and third in critical early states, but you'd hardly know it if you watched this week's episode of The Weekly, an hourlong documentary on the editorial board's process of endorsing a candidate for president.
Buttigieg, Binyamin Appelbaum charges, has been on "the front lines of corporate price-fixing." Most of the mayor's edit is dedicated to the board grilling him for not seeming angry enough and for having committed the sin of serving in the military and working as a consultant for McKinsey. Buttigieg keeps his calm, even as the board displays such obvious contempt for him, but the commentary afterward displays the caricature it wishes to weld of him.
“Success as a politician requires you to convince voters that you feel their problems, and I do not get the sense — maybe it’s because I’m not from the Midwest — but he did not give me the sense that he feels these problems," Appelbaum riffed.
“Even his tone, that’s not what people want right now," Aisha Harris concluded. "Like, I don’t feel excited by him.”
The Weekly cast Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur who's outlasted four senators, three governors, five representatives, and two mayors in his remarkably powerful presidential bid, as nothing more than a cheap joke. Rather than include one of Yang's dozens of expert answers about the economy or his detailed plans, the editorial board is shown patronizingly asking Yang what government secrets he would be most excited to discover as president.
When Jim Dao noted that Yang seemed deeply in touch with millennial concerns, Appelbaum all but wrote off Yang as the bimbo who only survives on The Bachelor for laughs.
“But it’s just hard to get around the sense that this guy should be running for, like, New York City Council," Appelbaum said. "I just kept on wanting to ask him, like, ‘Are you the guy who should be in charge of our national security?’”
You only have to watch the first half hour of the episode to learn that Elizabeth Warren earns one-half of the endorsement, if you didn't already gather that from the softballs lobbed at her in the interview transcript. The board can't help but ogle her as she trash talks Mitch McConnell and lectures the room.
"I like the fighting spirit, and I like the sense that I'm gonna shoot for the moon," Jesse Wegman gushed after the Massachusetts senator departed. "I know I won't hit it, but you gotta start there."
"Do you know who doesn't like to be lectured by powerful women?" Michelle Cottle asked with the coy smile reserved for America's Next Top Commander. "Male voters."
No such allowance is made for Joe Biden, the dominant front-runner of the race and the only candidate clearly capable of winning the Electoral College over President Trump. The board spends most of its Biden interview grilling him on his electability because of his age. The former vice president is indignant in response. He mentions that in head-to-head polling, he has led Trump in Georgia, Texas, and Florida. The board seems unconvinced. When it then tries to bait Biden into endorsing the pie-in-the-sky proposals of his left-wing challengers, he pushes back hard. Despite the New York Times's refusal to see it, Biden is obviously still sharp and evidently the most commanding candidate in the race.
After a few members of the board conceded that Biden presented a strong showing, the calvacade of haters began their roast.
"This is such an uninspiring argument, just in general, that, like, there's this moment that feels very urgent and necessary, and it's just like, 'Let's just like, you know, put a warm body that a lot of people can agree on there,'" said Charlie Warzel. "We had a lot of people come in that chair with really interesting ideas."
"There is a real question to be had about whether this safe person is the one that will turn people out to the polls or if someone who really excites you and gives you something to vote for is who will turn people out to the polls," Lauren Kelley lamented.
While the elites disdain Uncle Joe, the working class evidently does not. The elevator operator in the New York Times building boasted to Biden that she's voting for him. To her, he was not a mere "warm body."
Predictably, Biden doesn't even make the final four because he's not ambitious enough. But neither do Bernie Sanders nor Yang, because they're too ambitious. In fact, the board grants more credence to the absurd notion that it would endorse Michael Bloomberg over the candidates who actually participated in the endorsement process. (Bloomberg actually gets a vote from an editorial board member, whereas Yang does not.)
Mayor Pete makes the cut of the final four, but only barely, as the board complains that he doesn't emote enough. Rounding out the finalists are Cory Booker, who has since dropped out of the race, and eventual endorsement winners Warren and Amy Klobuchar.
Of course, and as anyone who read the eventual 3,452-word editorial explaining the endorsement, Warren was the real winner all along. She got the good edit. And the spineless co-endorsement of Klobuchar, who is repeatedly denounced for not appearing charismatic enough to the editors, only bolsters Warren's chances by giving Klobuchar a boost against early state front-runners Biden and Buttigieg.
Ultimately, the board gives out two roses, never seriously grappling with where the Democratic Party ought to go. The editors never have an ideological conversation or any meaningful reflections on the successes and failures of the Obama era. The end result is an hour of back-slapping and self-indulgence, with very little thought given to the actual voters who eventually must pick one candidate.
The board may claim that the publicity around its endorsement process is designed to be straightforward with readers, but it's clear that this is an exercise in the exact sort of fame-seeking that catapulted its enemy into the White House.

Biden campaign warns media of Trump 'misinformation' in impeachment trial

Texto completo: Joe Biden's presidential campaign sent a memo to reporters warning them about spreading "misinformation" regarding claims that the former vice president inappropriately interfered in Ukraine to protect his son, Hunter Biden. The claim is popular among President Trump and some of his most ardent defenders.
The Monday memo, which was first reported by NBC News and released only a day before the president's impeachment trial is scheduled to begin in the Senate, also attacks those who have argued for one or both of the Bidens to testify in the trial. It alleges that Trump "weaponized foreign and national security policy in an attempt to coerce a foreign country into lying about a rival presidential candidate."
The president has been accused of having withheld aid to Ukraine in order to persuade government officials to investigate Joe Biden and his son regarding the latter's work with Ukrainian company Burisma, which had previously faced accusations of corruption. Trump has alleged that Joe Biden inappropriately wielded his own power as vice president to get Viktor Shokin, a Russia-aligned Ukrainian prosecutor general, removed from his position, claiming the move was made to protect his son. Shokin was widely regarded as corrupt.
Joe Biden's deputy campaign manager, Kate Bedingfield, and senior adviser, Tony Blinken, the authors of the memo, alleged the president has been "spreading a malicious and conclusively debunked conspiracy theory" that "Biden engaged in wrongdoing when he executed official United States policy to remove a corrupt prosecutor from office."
They also point out that the Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, Associated Press, and fact-checks from the Washington Post and New York Times have all labeled the president's claims about the Bidens as false or misleading.
"Since Trump was exposed debasing his office in an unprecedented way, his defenders have attempted to distract from his malfeasance and smear Biden by repeating this now comprehensively-debunked conspiracy theory," they wrote. "It is not sufficient to say the allegations are 'unsubstantiated' or that 'no evidence has emerged to support them.'”
The memo concluded by noting that no "political entity" should act as an editor, claiming that failing to report on this narrative in a way that doesn't identify it as a "conspiracy theory" with "false accusations" results in making a reporter "an enabler of misinformation."

The New York Times and Trump agree: Bernie Sanders can win

Texto completo: Although Joe Biden remains the only candidate in the Democratic primary to repeatedly outperform President Trump in red state polls, such as Texas and North Carolina, Bernie Sanders is closing in on the front-runner's pivotal lead in the Rust Belt swing states that handed Trump the Oval Office. If Sanders wins the nomination, he could narrowly beat Trump in a general election.
Trump clearly knows this, given the tenor of his recent tweets chiding the septuagenarian socialist.
Tweet
Given the word salad of an anti-Bernie endorsement from the editorial board of the New York Times, the newspaper of record knows this too.
The editorial board's disdain for both Bernie and Biden was evident from the mere transcripts of its interviews, but its anti-Sanders animus was rendered only more weird by its blatant favoritism towards fellow leftist Elizabeth Warren. During the interview, the board repeatedly tried to fact check Bernie on immigration's effect on labor with fallacious logic and call out his plans for being too ambitious. But Warren was hotly celebrated by the board for that same pie-in-sky liberalism.
Whatever the reason for its Bernie bashing, the reason for its salience became evident in its final endorsement editorial: Bernie can win, and like Trump, the Times finally gets this.
Despite their radically oppositional politics, both Bernie and Biden poll well with two key demographics: working-class white voters and voters of color. Even more importantly, Bernie comes second to Biden in key swing states.
Recent polling shows that Bernie beats Trump outside of the margin of error in head-to-head polling in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. While he polls less well than Biden and still doesn't clinch other Trump states that Biden gets, states won by Hillary Clinton in 2016 plus those three total 273 votes in the Electoral College. You only need 270 to win.
Republicans praying for Bernie to eke out the nomination better be careful for what they wish for. If the Times turned any more votes to Warren and away from Bernie (mind you, one day before at least a two week period where Senate impeachment rules will render both all but invisible to the outside world), they could have offered Trump the best gift of his candidacy yet.

Texto completo: The New York Times editorial board compared Sen. Bernie Sanders’s rigidity to compromise and apparent divisiveness with President Trump while discussing its Democratic primary endorsements.
The paper broke with its precedent and endorsed two candidates for 2020, Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The decision came after all of the candidates were interviewed, and in discussing its choice, the board highlighted some similarities between the Vermont senator and Trump.
Although Sanders, 78, is seen as one of the front-runners in the Democratic race, the New York Times said that not only is his health a “serious concern,” but also that his approach to politics is a problem.
“He boasts that compromise is anathema to him,” the editorial reads. “Only his prescriptions can be the right ones, even though most are overly rigid, untested and divisive. He promises that once in office, a groundswell of support will emerge to push through his agenda."
“Three years into the Trump administration, we see little advantage to exchanging one over-promising, divisive figure in Washington for another,” the editorial continued.
The board went on to endorse Warren, 70: “Good news, then, that Elizabeth Warren has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic left.”
It also endorsed Klobuchar, 59, and said that she “has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic center.”
A RealClearPolitics national average of polls has Joe Biden leading with 28.4% support, followed by Sanders at 20.4%, and Warren at 14.8%. Klobuchar is near the back of the pack, registering only 3% support.

Texto completo: Democratic presidential front-runners Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were not in the New York Times editorial board's top four choices for the 2020 primary.
The editorial board revealed a combined endorsement of Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Sunday night. While the board opted not to pick just one candidate, it also revealed who made the final cut: Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, despite the fact that he suspended his campaign last week, and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The editorial board hit at Biden's message of "returning the country to where things were before the Trump era," claiming that doing so would "not get America where it needs to go as a society." The board also pointed out Biden's age, 77, and argued that it's "time for him to pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders."
Similarly, the editorial board expressed concern for Sanders's health, noting his recent heart attack, while also attacking him for "boast[ing] that compromise is anathema to him."
"Obviously, we are also extremely torn," New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay said Monday in an appearance on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "The editorial board of the New York Times is really traditionalist. It's an institutionalist newspaper, progressive to be sure, but this is an acknowledgment, especially our endorsement of Warren, Sen. Warren, that the institutions in this country need strengthening in a way that may require something far beyond what it did in the past."
Gay also noted that the board's decision to endorse two candidates shows "there's more than one pathway forward."

The arc of America’s history is bent by institutions

Texto completo: Politicians, mostly on the Left, love to misappropriate Martin Luther King Jr.’s promise that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Among the many problems with a flippant deployment of this line is that it gives the sense that social change happens through some disembodied force akin to evolution.
There are philosophical foundations to this worldview. If you read enough Hegel or absorb the teachings of Marx, who tried to channel Hegel, you will find a sense of almost predestination. It’s not predestination exactly, but it does portray societal change as something largely independent of the people involved.
It’s a particularly cruel irony coming from those who would pay tribute to King. It implies that without his efforts and sacrifice, things would have ended up the same.
Conservatives seeking to praise King make the opposite error. They make him out to be a "great man," the sort of unique individual who with courage, persistence, and self-sacrifice changes history almost entirely on his own.
Neither story is totally wrong. But both miss a crucial, perhaps the crucial, thing about King’s civil rights work.
The civil rights movement was not a movement of history or of a few great men. It was a movement of institutions. Churches, organizations of pastors, universities, and countless other entities brought individuals together for common action aimed at a higher good and strengthened the individuals involved through norms and practices that imbued virtues.
Once you realize the central nature of institutions, particularly churches, to the civil rights movement, you have to wonder whether this could happen today. These days, particularly when compared to the 1960s, Americans are going through a “crisis of dissolution” as Yuval Levin puts it in his important new book, A Time to Build.
Americans have lost trust in the most important institutions, including churches, governments, media, and universities. Levin deftly and concisely explores the many reasons for the dissolution, including the sins of the institutions and their exploitation by those seeking to use them as platforms rather than formative associations.
image0 (3).jpeg
Levin also explores a more fundamental cause for the dissolution: Americans have always had a natural suspicion of institutions. “Our popular culture has its roots in a dissenting Protestantism,” Levin notes, “that sought a direct connection to the divine and rejected as inauthentic or illegitimate most forms of institutional mediation.”
We therefore try to tell stories about ourselves that are fundamentally false because they zoom in to the individual level or zoom out to the societal level. Thus, we miss where the universe bending happens: in our institutions.
“When progressives tell the American story,” Levin notes, “they often speak in terms of mass social movements crashing as waves upon our shores — notable particularly for their lack of institutional form.”
The New York Times today has a good antidote to that disembodied view of the civil rights movement. It’s a lively profile of one of King’s compatriots, Ella Baker.
“Her political activism began in Harlem in the 1930s,” the New York Times notes. “She worked with the cooperative movement during the Great Depression.”
The cooperative movement, also known as the self-help cooperative movement, was an incredible story about human resilience and American ingenuity. It is tied up historically with communism, but it was also a perfect encapsulation of American institutionalism.
The co-ops were institutions that brought people together, created rules and systems that not only multiplied the power of individuals but also reinforced virtues and work ethics.
Here’s a description from one history:
“At the cooperative in Santa Monica, members worked at local dairies for milk and cheese. They had an arrangement with the College of Agriculture at UCLA to tend the trees at UCLA’s experimental farm in exchange for fruit. The Huntington Park Cooperative had vegetable gardens on vacant land, harvesting more than 27,000 pounds of fresh produce in just one quarter of 1936. Typically, cooperatives were able to find vacant buildings to use at no charge for meeting places, to store their bartered goods, and to conduct business.”
These were little platoons that organized people together to do what could not be done by either the whole (the economy or the central government) or the individual. (Of course, many of the loudest voices involved with these cooperatives tried to abstract from the actual institutions and turn them into an argument for national or global communism.)
Read through the New York Times's piece on Baker's work, and you see institution after institution. She played a top role in many local branches of the NAACP. She worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Council, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party.
These were all organizations that sought to connect people engaged in the same struggle and to establish norms and methods, such as nonviolence, for carrying out the struggle. And of course, these institutions provided the philosophical underpinnings (Christian teaching, largely) for both the ends they sought and the means they preached.
Barbara Ransby, the historian who wrote the New York Times piece on Baker, has one particularly incisive paragraph:
"'Strong people don’t need a strong leader,' she declared, warning activists to eschew messiahs and saviors and build local leaders by the thousands. 'Martin didn’t make the movement,' she said. Rather, 'the movement made Martin.'"
As Levin would put it, great institutions “form us” if we “pour ourselves into them.”
Individuals acting through and upon institutions, and likewise letting those institutions act through and upon them, is what changes history for the better. That's why Levin's message is so important — this is a time to rebuild our institutions.

Texto completo: Joe Biden's campaign is spinning the New York Times's endorsement snub with a viral clip from the newspaper's video footage.
"We got the endorsement that actually equals votes!" Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz tweeted Monday, along with the video.
Tweet
In the recording, a female elevator operator in the Times building woman gushes over Biden, 77, during a ride to his interview with the paper's editorial board, saying that she loved him and that he was her "favorite."
"You got a camera? [When] we get out, we'll take one, OK?" Biden told her, offering to snap a selfie with the supporter.
"You are awesome. Oh my God," she replied.
The interaction has been watched more than 180,000 times on Twitter as of Monday afternoon, more than the videos made for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar combined.

Tweet
On Sunday night, the New York Times hedged by endorsing Warren, 70, and Klobuchar, 59, for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, two women candidates from opposing points on the center-left side of the political spectrum.
"Amy Klobuchar has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic center. Her vision goes beyond the incremental. Given the polarization in Washington and beyond, the best chance to enact many progressive plans could be under a Klobuchar administration," the board wrote. "Three years into the Trump administration, we see little advantage to exchanging one over-promising, divisive figure in Washington for another. Good news, then, that Elizabeth Warren has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic left."
Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the front-runners in the Democratic primary, did not make the board's final four contenders, instead rating former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. Booker, 50, dropped out of the race earlier in January.

Texto completo: The New York Times editorial board took aim at Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders because of their age and health.
While discussing the 2020 Democratic candidates for president, the editorial board of the New York Times said that it was time for Biden, 77, to "pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders," invoking the words of Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, 39, in the first 2020 primary debate.
The newspaper criticized Biden's message of electability, saying, "merely restoring the status quo will not get America where it needs to go as a society."
The New York Times did not cite the same concerns with former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, 77, who is the same age as the former vice president.
Additionally, the editorial board looked at Sanders's chances of winning the presidency with a skeptical eye, citing its concerns with his health and age. "Mr. Sanders would be 79 when he assumed office, and after an October heart attack, his health is a serious concern," it wrote.
The board then contrasted its objections to the Vermont senator with praise of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, calling her a "standard-bearer for the Democratic left." The newspaper's endorsement mentioned Warren's age: 70. Warren has previously joked that she would become the "youngest woman ever inaugurated" as president if she were to win the 2020 election.
In 2016, the New York Times dismissed concerns over former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's age and health. One day after Clinton, then 68, seemingly fainted during a 2016 memorial ceremony of 9/11, the newspaper cited public opinion polls that indicated 74% of registered voters said they were unconcerned about her being healthy enough to carry out the job of president.
The newspaper also reported Clinton was healthier than most Americans her age, citing multiple doctors.

Texto completo: As reporters delved into the Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and a Russian lawyer amid claims of a cover-up, Donald Trump Jr. was forced to apologize to his father and warn him that things were about to get worse.
“I’m really sorry about this, Dad,” the junior Trump, 42, said in a hastily arranged conference call as reporters began to learn that the meeting was based on an offer of damaging information about Hillary Clinton.
A new book, A Very Stable Genius. by two Washington Post reporters, spells out the backstage drama as Trump Jr. was forced to admit to his father that he had made misleading statements about the 2016 meeting.
“It’s a f---ing mess,” President Trump said in response. “It’s interfering with my agenda. This is screwing up what I’m trying to do.”
Campaign chairman Paul Manafort, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Trump Jr. met Natalia Veselnitskaya, a Kremlin-connected lawyer, and others in June 2016 at their campaign headquarters soon after Trump had clinched the Republican nomination.
Trump Jr. had been an enthusiastic booster of his father's presidency, developing a reputation as a take-no-prisoners speaker who is popular with the Trump base. But the book suggests the episode was a deeply humiliating moment for a son who wanted his moment in the spotlight.
"After long existing in the shadow of his superstar younger sister whom their father openly favored, Trump junior had enjoyed playing a valued role in the campaign, but revelations about the Trump Tower meeting made him a liability to his dad," it concludes.
After the election, with questions swirling about the campaign’s connections to Moscow, Trump Jr., in a press release dictated by the president, 73, said the meeting was primarily to discuss the adoption of Russian children by Americans.
But in July 2017, he acknowledged that he arranged the meeting expecting to receive opposition research from Veselnitskaya that could hurt Clinton's campaign.
It was about to get worse, according to the new account. White House officials learned that the New York Times had obtained Trump Jr.’s email exchange with a British publicist who brokered the meeting.
After three days of brutal news coverage, aides were preparing for fresh revelations, prompting Trump Jr.’s apology in a call with his lawyers and the president. Trump interrupted with occasional groans as the extent of the mess became clear.
The conversation then turned to whether or not to release all of the emails or just a portion of them. Trump Jr. and his lawyers recommended publishing all of them.
“The rest of them are going to leak anyway,” was Trump Jr.’s reasoning.
“F--- it,” said the president. “Publish them all.”

Texto completo: The New York Times' editorial board took an unorthodox route by endorsing two Democratic candidates for president, Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. This shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone considering the paper's desperation for someone to beat President Trump, but the candidates it chose are surprising given their long odds of victory.
The endorsement of both candidates is a blatant slap in the face to black voters, a majority of whom have placed their support behind former Vice President Joe Biden. It shows the New York Times editorial board didn’t take into account that to win the Democratic nomination, you have to do well with black voters who are the Democratic Party’s most loyal and important voting bloc. Neither Warren nor Klobuchar polls well with black voters. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll has Warren receiving 9% of the black vote and Klobuchar receiving less than 0.5% support from black voters.
There is a consistent and persistent theme in politics, a serious level of naivete regarding electoral politics and black voters. This endorsement by the New York Times is the clearest example of that and shows just how little people understand about black voters, including the white “woke” liberal class.
Let’s take a deeper look at the Washington Post-Ipsos poll, conducted Jan. 2-8.
When asked who has the “best chance of beating Trump,” 53% of black voters said Biden, compared with 18% for Bernie Sanders, 5% for Warren, and Klobuchar, who had 0.5% or less.
When asked who would best “handle issues important to black voters” among the Democratic candidates, 32% said Biden, 19% Sanders, 7% Warren, and once again, Klobuchar had less than 0.5%.
When asked who “would unite the country,” 43% of black voters said Biden, 19% said Sanders, 6% said Warren, and 1% said Klobuchar.
When asked which candidates are “closest on issues” to black voters, 35% said Biden, 20% said Sanders, 9% said Warren, and 2% said Klobuchar.
With numbers such as those for both Warren and Klobuchar, how in the world could any sensible person expect one of them to win the Democratic nomination, let alone win in a general election? No serious person should give the New York Times endorsement any serious consideration or weight because it doesn’t warrant any.
This endorsement says a lot about how black voters are viewed and their importance in electoral politics and not in a good way. The endorsement speaks of a class of people, like demigods, who are so far removed from the reality of how black voters feel, they didn’t even bother to place any serious weight on actual data that showcase black sentiments.
Endorsements are supposed to be meaningful and go to candidates who can actually win. They’re supposed to signify candidates who are in the best position to cross the finish line, which neither Warren or Klobuchar can do with their current standings. Moreover, the lack of thoughtfulness, serious consideration, and reflection that comes as a result of this endorsement voids it of all legitimacy.
This endorsement will be nothing more than a temporary boost that may yield a brief increase in fundraising, but that's it. It won't help Warren or Klobuchar increase their standings with black voters, and until that changes, neither one has a chance of winning their party nomination.
The road to the Democratic nomination and ultimately the White House if you’re a Democrat is with African Americans. The fact that the New York Times would endorse two candidates who can’t win over black voters makes a mockery of the importance of the black community.

Texto completo: The Heritage Foundation, where President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence often look to for policy guidance and support, is boosting its team to take on threats of socialism and academic liberalism driving that challenge to democracy.
The Capitol Hill-based think tank that has advised Republican presidents from Ronald Reagan to Trump told Secrets that it has brought on four visiting scholars who are experts and advocates of American “exceptionalism,” and who will help it tackle the socialistic trend exploding on colleges campuses and among politicians in and outside of Washington.
“Their academic credentials will allow Heritage to more forcefully engage on some of the biggest issues confronting our country: the decline in civics, the left’s takeover of our educational institutions, the rise in popularity of socialism, and challenges to our form of government,” said the organization in its announcement.
The new team:

The four, who Heritage plans to feature in its regular and social media, “will allow Heritage to more forcefully engage on some of the biggest issues confronting our country: the decline in civics, the left’s takeover of our educational institutions, the rise in popularity of socialism, and challenges to our form of government,” it said.
Heritage noted, for example, that Guelzo has tackled the New York Times 1619 Project on slavery. “The 1619 Project is not history. It is conspiracy theory,” Guelzo told a Heritage audience in October 2019. “This is polemic, and a polemic born in the imagination of those whose primary target is capitalism itself, and who hoped to tarnish capitalism by associating it with slavery,” he added.
Heritage President Kay C. James said, “From its inception, the Heritage Foundation has always worked to bring together the best minds in the country to develop solutions to the pressing issues that America faces. These new scholars in the Feulner Institute’s Simon Center are no exception. We are truly excited about the work they will undertake and we hope it will provide the foundation to inspire and unify the American people under a common purpose and a common set of principles.”
Heritage is relocating the Simon Center for American Studies within the Feulner Institute, named for Heritage founder Edwin J. Feulner.

Texto completo: DES MOINES, Iowa — Pete Buttigieg said President Trump's policies and rhetoric hurt the mental health of young minorities and transgender people during a forum on issues facing black and Hispanic communities.
"No question," the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, 38, said Monday when asked by a moderator about whether Trump is hurting the psychological well-being of minority children in the country. "When you believe the leader of your own country doesn't see you or doesn't want you to succeed, of course it is bad for your health."

Issues facing minority communities has been a major concern for Buttigieg's campaign, which has some of the lowest approval ratings among black voters out of the major 2020 Democrats.

During an interview with the New York Times earlier this month, Buttigieg was asked about his nickname "Mayo Pete." Although he claimed not to be familiar with it, Buttigieg did say he wished to be associated with a different condiment.

"Hopefully, it’s at least a better flavor. I don’t know," Buttigieg said. "I actually hate flavored mayo — they do this avocado stuff now, and it — because I only use mayo when I’m making tuna salad. And I want it as straightforward as possible."

New York Times's dual endorsement tries to cut the cake and eat it too

Texto completo: What's more woke than endorsing one woman for president? Endorsing two.
This was the cowardly, craven choice of the editorial board at the New York Times.
After weeks of hyping "The Endorsement" as an unprecedented display of transparency and a monumental decision from the newspaper of record, the Times published its editorial and an hourlong documentary of the process. As the "radical," they endorse Elizabeth Warren, who's keeping at third place nationally but flailing in fourth in critical early states. As the "realist," they endorse Amy Klobuchar, whose path to the Democratic nomination is contingent on a blowout performance in the Iowa caucuses.
In other words, the Times offered a boost to Klobuchar to bump Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg's early state polling down a peg and pave a wider path for Warren to win the nomination. It's journalistic cowardice dressed up as feminism and blinded by self-importance, and it just goes to show how truly out of touch the editorial board is with the electorate.
That Warren had earned its endorsement was evident from the start. The Times made sure to elucidate its bias in the tone and tenor of its questioning. Warren's interview with the editorial board opened with leading questions to allow her to attack Biden and President Trump. They didn't ask a single question throughout the hourlong interview about her lies about her ethnicity to advance her legal career, or about being fired for being pregnant. In contrast, two of the first three questions directed towards Buttigieg were about whether he "didn't just want to make a lot of money" in taking a coveted consulting job at McKinsey.
So Warren's endorsement was a foregone conclusion. But Klobuchar's the result of the editorial board's inability to comprehend, let alone tackle, the liberal-leftist civil war ensuing within the Democratic Party.
The editorial board's contempt for Trump is expected. But its outright dismissal of the dominant front-runner, Biden, and leftist leader, Bernie Sanders, as well as its latent contempt for Buttigieg, is eerily foreboding for the state of the media's relationship with the Democratic Party. They chose two of the candidates, both unfavorable with the nonwhite members of the electorate, overlooking the three candidates most overwhelmingly likely to become the nominee and the only one likely to become president. And not only that, but they resorted to petty ageism to back a candidate who is already older than our oldest president was on his Inauguration Day.
In a way, its decision was almost a concession that legacy media won't decide the primary. Why pretend that they can?

Chemerinsky: Making a UC tuition hike fair

Texto completo: Californians want education to be affordable. They also want great universities. But with costs rising and tuition basically frozen since 2011, something has to give. The University of California system needs a tuition hike.
The fairest way to do this is through “cohort-based tuition,” a proposal the University of California’s Board of Regents will consider at its Wednesday meeting.
Under a cohort-based model, tuition is set at the time a student enters a UC degree program and then is kept flat for that cohort for the next six years as long as a student remains enrolled. Any changes in tuition would apply only to new, incoming cohorts.
The proposal would be a huge help to campuses in planning and programming, since they would be able to project tuition revenue from continuing students and thus have a clearer sense of future resources. The approach also provides sorely needed predictability for students and their families, allowing them to know what they will be paying each year.
In the past, that was a huge problem. Between 2000 and 2010, undergraduate in-state tuition rose in nine out of 10 years, with increases ranging from $384 to $1,818 per year. Students and their parents were understandably upset about the unpredictable cost of attending college and the challenge of meeting ever-higher fees.
But the response to the situation — a virtual tuition freeze for the next nine years — is unsustainable.
In California, higher education spending accounted for 18% of the 1976-77 state budget, but by 2019-20, funding had fallen to 12% of the state budget. These cuts have been felt most strongly at the University of California, where state funding per full-time student fell from nearly $29,000 per year to less than $13,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars. In recent years, the state has also required the university to take substantially more students.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s newly proposed budget for next year includes a welcome 5% increase in state funds for the University of California, but this does not begin to offset the need for a tuition increase. Since state funds are only 42% of the core funds the UC relies on to educate students, an increase of 5% in state support translates into a 2.1% increase in the budget, which barely covers inflation. The budget proposal also mandates that schools serve more students. An increase in tuition is essential simply for the UCs to stay even, without beginning to make up for a decade of cuts and frozen tuition.
Since 2011, annual tuition has been raised only once, by $282 (about 2.5%) in 2017. Meanwhile, in other states, tuition continued to rise during that period. According to the College Board, “in-state tuition and fees at public four-year institutions increased at an average rate of 2.2% per year beyond inflation” between 2009 and 20019. And that figure is what was raised beyond inflation. The UC system faced the same kind of inflation and increased costs during the period, with almost no increase in tuition.
Without substantial additional funds, class sizes will grow, students will find it harder to take the classes they need to graduate, recruiting and retaining top faculty will be much harder and there will have to be cuts in funding for important research. Those assertions aren’t made lightly or with the intent of frightening potential students. They are simply the grim reality.
Of course, students struggling to pay for school are alarmed at the idea of any increase in tuition. But frozen tuition also hurts the students who most need financial assistance from the university. The nontuition costs of attending college — books, health insurance, rent and food — increased by 17.8% from 2012 to 2018, but the university has had no additional funds to help needy students meet those increases because of the freeze. We need to simultaneously increase both tuition and financial aid. The UC system redirects about one-third of undergraduate tuition income — more than $750 million per year — toward financial aid for lower- and middle-income state residents, and that should continue.
It is impossible to overstate the importance of the University of California to the state and its residents, especially in its promotion of social and economic mobility. According to a New York Times study, six of the top seven universities in terms of the economic diversity of their students were UC campuses. The system’s strong public mission makes it different from even the best private schools, but that hasn’t sacrificed quality. The universities’ research in countless fields continues to be invaluable.
Today, the state’s residents — and the UC regents — are at a point where they must decide whether to continue to have a great university system. The path of the last decade, if continued, will undermine quality in a way that cannot be easily restored. The regents should approve cohort-based tuition and implement predictable tuition increases to maintain and enhance the quality of the country’s finest public university system, the University of California.

Texto completo: On Tuesday at 1 p.m., the Senate will begin the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. But for Congress, the more important date may come two weeks later, on Feb. 4. That evening President Trump—freshly vindicated by the impeachment failure to remove him from office—will deliver the most consequential State of the Union address of his presidency thus far.
Right now most press coverage is obsessing over impeachment minutiae. Will former national security adviser John Bolton testify? If he does, will Republicans insist that Hunter Biden, and maybe even Joe Biden, be called as well? Were the celebratory impeachment signing pens given out by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appropriate for what she claims was a "solemn" occasion? How long will the trial take? And so on.
Given that we already know how this story ends—even with a few defectors, Democrats are unlikely to come close to the 20 Republican votes they need to convict Mr. Trump—all these are distractions. The big question is what comes after impeachment fails and the president is still standing.
Assuming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell delivers the swift trial Republicans expect, it would mean a State of the Union delivered by a newly triumphant Mr. Trump. In contrast to the low ratings that have characterized the impeachment coverage thus far, many more Americans are sure to tune in to the State of the Union to see what a Donald Trump liberated from impeachment will say. The heightened interest comes courtesy of the overreach by his many enemies: intelligence chiefs who falsely called him a Russian agent, a press corps that has dropped objective reporting as an unaffordable luxury and, of course, the House Democrats who presided over the most partisan impeachment in U.S. history.
Mr. Trump won't be the first to emerge politically strengthened by the failure of his antagonists. Bill Clinton also went through the same process and came out stronger, notwithstanding the impeachment asterisk that sticks to his name in the history books.
There were some differences. After the House impeached him Mr. Clinton's approval rating jumped to 73%—the highest rating he ever enjoyed and higher than even Ronald Reagan at his peak. The Republicans who controlled the Senate during Mr. Clinton's trial were more divided than the Senate Republicans who will run this trial. And Mr. Clinton, who was not running for re-election, delivered his 1999 State of the Union in mid-January—in the midst of his Senate trial, not after it.
Still, it's worth looking back at Mr. Clinton's impeachment State of the Union for clues about what Mr. Trump might say. In 1999, Mr. Clinton made no mention of impeachment. Instead, he invoked a humming American economy and asked Congress to put partisanship aside and come together to fix Social Security and address other issues affecting ordinary Americans.
"Tonight," Mr. Clinton said, "I stand before you to report that America has created the longest peacetime economic expansion in our history—with nearly 18 million new jobs, wages rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, the highest homeownership in history, the smallest welfare rolls in 30 years, and the lowest peacetime unemployment since 1957."
"America," declared Mr. Clinton, "is working again."
Then he went on the road. Two days later, the New York Times ran a story with this headline: "Clinton Gets a Rock-Star Reception at 2 Northeast Rallies." According to the story, "an exuberant President Clinton starred today in two rollicking rallies." The Times piece went on to quote the African-American preacher who delivered the invocation as saying Mr. Clinton had been "the greatest president for our people of all time." Sound like anyone we know?
Remember, Mr. Clinton was doing all this while his fate as president was still in the Senate's hands. When Mr. Trump gets his night at the House podium, by contrast, almost certainly it will be after the Senate has either voted to acquit or dismissed the charges against him.
It's not hard to imagine Mr. Trump's outdoing Mr. Clinton in emphasizing his real achievements, including an economy that's delivering prosperity not only for Wall Street but for Main Street. African-Americans, for example, are working at record numbers, and their average wage growth now outpaces wage growth for white Americans. In foreign policy, he can boast of an America that doesn't seek war but won't hesitate to use lethal force against those who would kill Americans. Like Mr. Clinton, too, Mr. Trump will no doubt end by calling on lawmakers to put past disputes behind them so they can come together to carry out his agenda for the American people.
Simply by addressing the nation from the House podium, the president will underscore the weakness of Mrs. Pelosi and her caucus. The implicit message will be this: You have thrown everything at me, including the constitutional equivalent of a nuclear weapon. Yet here I am.
Friedrich Nietzsche famously wrote that "what does not kill me makes me stronger." At this year's State of the Union, Mr. Trump may be the living proof.

Celebrate the Citizens United Decade; The ruling has empowered small-dollar donors and political outsiders, not corporations.

Texto completo: 'Last week," President Obama declared a decade ago, "the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests—including foreign corporations—to spend without limit in our elections."
Mr. Obama was wrong in almost every respect about Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which the court decided on Jan. 21, 2010. Hysterical predictions about Citizens United—then-Rep. Ed Markey, among others, compared it to Dred Scott—haven't held up.
Contrary to Mr. Obama's assertion about a century of law, Citizens United overturned portions of McCain-Feingold, a campaign-finance law that wasn't even 10 years old, and another law from 1947. Those laws prohibited unions and corporations, including nonprofits, from voicing support for or opposition to candidates for federal office.
Citizens United didn't affect the longstanding ban on corporate contributions to candidates, and it didn't legalize foreign political spending in the U.S. Most Russian online ads in 2016 would have been protected under the First Amendment even before Citizens United, because the ads didn't urge a vote for or against a candidate.
Far from handing power to the 1%, Citizens United unleashed rapid political diversification. Since the ruling, the White House or Congress has changed parties in every federal election except 2012. Twenty eighteen saw the highest midterm voter turnout in a century. Small-dollar donors are more coveted than ever. Donald Trump raised more money from donors who gave less than $200 than any candidate in history.
Since Citizens United, party outsiders such as Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders have risen to national prominence. And money hasn't been able to buy elections as predicted. Sheldon Adelson donated record amounts to Republican super PACs in 2012 but failed to prevent strong Democratic victories. Democrats Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg came up empty after putting huge sums of money behind climate change and gun control.
Hillary Clinton outspent Mr. Trump 3 to 1 in 2016. Congressional leaders and big-time fundraisers such as Reps. Eric Cantor (R., Va.) and Joe Crowley (D., N.Y.) lost their seats to primary challengers who spent a fraction of what the incumbents did. Incumbent re-election rates in the House never dipped below 94% from 1996 to 2008, but did in 2010, 2012 and 2018.
Citizens United deserves a share of credit for all these trends. The decision made it easier to promote (or criticize) a candidate without help from party leaders or media elites.
Perhaps the worst prediction was that Citizens United would allow a corporate takeover of democracy. The New York Times accused the justices of having "paved the way for corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections" and "thrust politics back to the robber-baron era of the 19th century."
A decade later, most spending comes from the same place it always has: individuals who donate directly to candidates, up to legally limited amounts. Corporations contribute well under 10% of federal political spending, Their voice is not dominant—and voters have a right to hear it. Justice Anthony Kennedy and his colleagues didn't hold that "money is speech" or "corporations are people." The ruling was part of a healthy shift in favor of free speech in politics—a trend that began with 2007's Wisconsin Right to Life v. FEC, and continued through 2014's McCutcheon v. FEC.
The questions is whether the justices think their work is done. If they truly want to empower democracy, they should continue to look skeptically at regulation of campaign finance. Political speech, after all, is at the core of the First Amendment's protection.
Mr. Smith served as chairman of the Federal Election Commission, 2001-05, and is chairman of the Institute for Free Speech.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON (AP) — The New York Times has endorsed not one but two candidates for the Democratic nomination for president, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar from the party's moderate wing and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren from the progressive wing.
The paper said Sunday it had chosen the two most effective candidates from the moderate and progressive sides of the party — without stating a preference for either approach. It praised Warren as "a gifted story teller" and Klobuchar as “the very definition” of Midwestern charisma and grit.
When mentioning another front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden, the Times acknowledged his years of experience, but also noted his age, 77, desire, and occasional gaffes. “It is time for him to pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders,” the paper said, borrowing from President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address.
The paper mentioned Sen. Bernie Sanders' age, 78, “serious concerns” about his health and noted his unwillingness to compromise. The paper praised another of the front-runners, 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, as likely to have “a bright political future. ”

The newspaper changed its approach to presidential endorsements this year, airing footage of candidate interviews and details about the endorsement process on a special edition of “The Weekly,” the FX network series about the Times.
In previous election years, the Times has often chosen a candidate popular with the party establishment. The Times endorsed Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary in 2016 and over a charismatic but unproven newcomer Barack Obama in 2008.
Learn more about Klobuchar: Her views on current issues
In 2004, the Times endorsed John Kerry and in 2000 chose Al Gore. Each time they chose a candidate who was popular with the Democratic establishment and, except for 2008, the eventual nominee.

Messenger: In some neighborhoods of north St. Louis, the homeless are invisible

Texto completo: The other day I was standing next to a food truck parked on Market Street next to Citygarden waiting for my lunch.
A gentleman, who I would later find out was homeless, approached.
As is common, my face was buried in my phone, texting, or tweeting, or mindlessly checking emails I've already read. The person told the man standing next to me that he was homeless and asked for a few bucks.
Instead, the man bought him lunch. They stood in line, the homeless man picked out what he wanted, and the downtown business man escaping for a bite to eat, bought him a meal and let him keep the change.
It was a beautiful moment of humanity.
Such opportunities are available most days if you live or work downtown. Like all big cities, St. Louis has a fairly large population of homeless people who congregate downtown. They come here for services at St. Patrick's Center or Biddle House, or they just seek the kindness of strangers. They sleep on benches and in parks because they have nowhere else to go.
The homeless people who live where Lydia Boda grew up, in the Ville neighborhood, are a little bit different.
"So many of our clients are the invisible people," Boda says.
She's the executive director of a nonprofit called Bridge of Hope Ministries that operates in the old "Little Williams" schoolhouse on Cottage Avenue. It's a small, one-story structure not far from the much larger -- and vacant -- Williams Middle School. Some of the people who seek services at Bridge of Hope tell stories of their parents attending Little Williams, once a segregated school attended only by black students.
Boda, 28, grew up here. She came to the Ville as an infant. Her parents, Robin and Stephen, were church planters from Philadelphia. Bridge of Hope was their church. Now it's much more, a community center that serves a growing homeless population in a community that a generation ago was thriving and full of children.
Boda is the executive director of a facility far from downtown that each day gives homeless people living in the Ville and Greater Ville a place to go for a meal, a cup of coffee, some clothes, a bike to borrow, a moment of silence, a shower, some dignity.
They're "invisible" because they live in the neighborhoods where they grew up, in crumbling and vacant brick homes -- "vacos," they call them -- with friends or family on a couch, or in one of the new homeless shelters run by Pastor Mike Robinson, a former employee at Bridge of Hope.
This is the homelessness that exists in places where many area residents rarely tread, in north and south St. Louis, in tucked away hills and valleys and highway overpasses in the suburbs.
"The need is growing," Boda says, and the system isn't set up to reach some of the people who need help the most.
Most of the people whom Boda sees on a daily basis are afraid to seek services through some of the larger organizations that serve the homeless population in St. Louis. They have criminal records and outstanding warrants. They are addicted to drugs -- heroin, opioids, crack.
As the organization that started in her parents' living room nearly two decades ago adjusts to meet the needs of the community it continues to serve, Boda hopes to find more ways to help the people she meets every day reach that "next level of care." That could be a roof over their heads, treatment for drug addiction, access to transportation, or jobs.
To do that, she needs money. Such is the life of a nonprofit -- Bridge of Hope became one in 2017. Boda's clients fly signs at highway on-ramps, she flies one in corporate boardrooms.
On March 28, author Ron Hall, whose book "Same Kind of Different as Me" became a New York Times best seller, will be the keynote speaker at a fundraiser at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers hall on Hampton Avenue. The message of Hall's book is one that is practiced at Bridge of Hope -- that helping people climb out of homelessness is about relationships. It's about building trust among people with different experiences.
"How was Christmas?" Debra Wiens asks a man named Jose. Wiens is carrying a load of socks and underwear into Bridge of Hope, where she is a volunteer and board member. She knows Jose and other members of the community who spend time there.
Jose is dressed for winter. The hood of his heavy coat is over his head; gloves pulled tight. The bike that gets him to and fro is leaning against the wall of the former school. He's happy to see his friend.
Wiens is a retired history teacher who lives in Creve Coeur. Some of her friends give her sideways looks when they find out how much time she spends in the Ville, but she doesn't give it a thought.
"It's about relationships," she says of homeless outreach, "relationships with people you would never expect to be in relationship with."

Barr isn't a toady. That's the nature of his job.

Texto completo: Many have been all too quick to make Attorney General William Barr out to be a reflexive toady for President Donald Trump. Just last week, the New York City Bar Association took the extreme step of writing to congressional leaders to investigate Barr for political bias. And last month, he came under blistering criticism for defending the Trump campaign and characterizing the FBI's Russia investigation into the 2016 election as bogus.
Slate has accused Barr of using the Department of Justice as "a personal law firm for Trump." Vox has bewailed "the department's politicization under Barr." The Daily Beast has lamented how Barr has "become another of Donald Trump's personal lawyers." The New York Times has noted that the attorney general had "reprised his role as a vocal defender of President Trump."
Perhaps none of these media outlets recall the time when then-Attorney General Eric Holder famously described himself as President Obama's "wingman." Curiously, Holder actually took to The Washington Post to decry Barr's ostensible self-debasement as an unfortunate "instrument of politics."
Holder's hypocrisy aside, the new stance in favor of a strongly independent attorney general among liberals is misguided as a matter of constitutional interpretation and ahistorical as a matter of American custom.
Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution states that "(t)he executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America." The power is vested not in numerous sources, but solely in the president. The president maintains plenary authority over the entirety of the executive branch.
The "unitary executive theory," which Democrats routinely excoriate, comes from the plain text of the Constitution. As Barr recently said during his remarks at the Federalist Society's 2019 National Lawyers Convention, the notion of the unitary executive "is not 'new,' and it is not a 'theory.' " On the contrary, he continued, "(i)t is a description of what the framers unquestionably did in Article II of the Constitution."
Throughout American history, attorneys general have intuited and acted upon their nonindependent subordination to presidents of the United States. In "Conflicting Loyalties: Law and Politics in the Attorney General's Office, 1789-1990," the scholar Nancy Baker explored the historical nature of the attorney general's position. Baker devoted entire book sections to "The Attorney General as a Legal Advisor" and "The Attorney General as a Policy Advisor." She observed that "before he became an administrator" of a sprawling Department of Justice bureaucracy, "the attorney general assumed the role of the advisor to the president." What's more, the attorney general's "responsibility" to serve in such an advisory capacity "has antecedents in seventeenth-century England."
Indeed, the role of the attorney general as a top presidential adviser has been a recurring theme throughout American history. When President Lincoln's attorney general, Edward Bates, famously wrote to Congress in 1861 to defend Lincoln's unilateral suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, he did so not as a neutral arbiter of legal principle, but as Lincoln's top legal adviser who shared his superior's ultimate policy aim of a Union victory in the Civil War. In modern times, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which was created by Congress during the New Deal, provides "legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies" and reviews "all executive orders and substantive proclamations proposed to be issued by the president." The president also has at his disposal the White House counsel's office, but that office tends to focus on legal issues arising from legislation, executive and judicial branch nominations and ethics questions.
Though the Office of Legal Counsel does sometimes reach legal conclusions at loggerheads with the White House, it is hardly independent in any meaningful way. Former Acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron, who led the OLC during the early years of the Obama administration, once stated that the office's legal analyses "may appropriately reflect the fact that its responsibilities also include facilitating the work of the executive branch and the objectives of the president, consistent with the law." And legal scholarship has observed the "systematic deference" that the Office of Legal Counsel generally shows toward the president's prerogatives.
Eric Holder was correct the first time. The attorney general, in large part, actually is the president's "wingman."

Texto completo: This is a golden age for "Theyism." This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite "they" out there and "they" are destroying life for the rest of us.
There is Donald Trump's culture-war Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our values and opening our borders. And there is Bernie Sanders' class-war Theyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and impoverish everyone else.
Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in society and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of America is trying to destroy the other part.
The Republican Party has been swallowed by Trump's culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sanders' class war.
These Democrats are doing this even though it is political suicide. Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing voters in the Midwest care more about their values - guns, patriotism, ending abortion, masculinity, whatever - than they do about proletarian class consciousness.
Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story is wrong.
Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as they negotiate wages with their employers. But then he blows this up into an all-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which capitalist power completely dominates worker power. This ideology crashes against the facts.
In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for those toward the top. If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?
Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity. For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34% and wages in those industries rose by 26%. Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20% while wages grew by 24%.
As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, capitalism is doing what it's supposed to do. It is rewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive. If you improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run people can't earn what they don't produce.
Third, and most important, most of the increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within them. As John Van Reenen of MIT has found, all over the world superstar businesses are racing ahead of their competitors. As those companies grow more productive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more. Companies that can't match that productivity don't, and their workers lag behind.
A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that there is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody else. Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, productivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very strong. Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market shares. But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies. Workers in those businesses suffer.
Today's successful bosses are doing what they should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and offering great service. A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a smaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workers' wages. In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge.
Thus, the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; it's the rise of productivity inequality.

Texto completo: RICHMOND - Thousands of people are expected to converge at Virginia's Capitol today to protest proposed changes to gun laws during a holiday traditionally reserved for lawmakers and the public to meet.
Richmond is under a state of emergency declared by Gov. Ralph Northam, who said the annual lobby day and rally has drawn the attention of militia and out-of-state groups who have come to "intimidate" and "cause harm."
"They are not coming to peacefully protest," the Democratic governor said Wednesday when he declared a temporary weapons ban on Capitol grounds, where the rally will be held at 11 a.m.
Tensions have been building across the state since Democrats gained a majority in the legislature and vowed to enact tighter gun control laws following the May mass shooting in Virginia Beach. As lawmakers filed bills to limit handgun purchases and require universal background checks, gun owners - first in rural counties, then in large cities like Virginia Beach - packed local government chambers, demanding localities not enforce any proposed legislation they considered an infringement on their Second Amendment rights.
In Richmond, Northam said intelligence officials had received "credible, serious threats" of violence comparable to those targeted towards Charlottesville, where in 2017 neo-Nazis and white supremacists clashed with counter protesters and a woman was killed.
A planned vigil for victims of gun violence, held annually on MLK Day for nearly three decades, was canceled Friday.
"Advocates have faced armed individuals trying to intimidate us each year," said Lori Haas, the state director for the Coalition Against Gun Violence. "But this year is different; we have received information that heavily armed white supremacists will be seeking to incite violence, and our organization has decided that the safety of our volunteers, advocates, and staff, many of whom are survivors of gun violence, must be our top priority."
Haas said a few hours later on a call with reporters that there was a "very, very good chance" she would still come to the Capitol today, but encouraged others to stay home.
"I don't think anyone should go down there with the intention whatsoever of having a conversation or a confrontation," she said.
On Thursday, FBI officials arrested three armed men suspected of being members of a neo-Nazi group that had discussed plans to come to Richmond today, The New York Times reported.
A heavier-than-usual police presence was felt at the Capitol all week, with fences going up around the building on Wednesday.
By Friday, a security checkpoint had been set up near the grounds' soon-to-be only entrance during the rally.
Roads around the Capitol will be closed to vehicles starting 8 a.m. today, when nearly 40 buses coordinated by the pro-gun-rights group Virginia Citizens Defense League - the main organizers of the rally - will arrive to lobby lawmakers in their offices across the street from the Capitol.
Virginia allows people to openly carry guns in public places, so those with weapons who are denied entry onto the grounds will likely be in the closed-off streets.
The Federal Aviation Administration on Friday announced temporary flight restrictions around Richmond. Northam said Wednesday one of the threats police knew about involved "weaponizing drones."
City and state police have urged people to stay home today - Martin Luther King Jr. Day and a state holiday - and all non-essential employees who work in or around the Capitol have been advised to stay home.
Suzette Denslow, the House clerk, said Friday the young pages who intern during session and help lawmakers with clerical duties will be staying home.
In a plea to members over the weekend, VCDL's president Philip Van Cleave asked for 10,000 members to commit to "taking one for the team" and coming unarmed for the rally inside Capitol grounds. He urged others to stand outside the perimeter with guns to "watch over your brothers and sisters inside the fence."
Still, Van Cleave has been urging members to remain peaceful today.
"The eyes of the nation and the world are on Virginia and VCDL right now and we must show them that gun owners are not the problem," he said in an email to members early Thursday morning. He's asked for the Virginia Supreme Court to appeal a lower court ruling that said Northam had the authority to institute a gun ban.
Van Cleave blamed Northam for the potential danger, saying his gun proposals escalated what otherwise has always been a calm lobby day.
"All these people coming, this whole flare up is because of him," he said in an interview. "He's the one that declared war on gun owners."

Elliott Schwartz tribute would have made late composer proud - and amused

Texto completo: Though he died in 2016, Elliott Schwartz remains Maine's most influential contemporary composer, not least because so many younger composers were among his students. To celebrate what would have been his 84th birthday, Philip Carlsen, the composer who succeeded Schwartz as director of the Portland Conservatory of Music's Back Cove Contemporary Music Festival, put together a concert.
As a composer who was always seeking new sounds and new ways to present familiar ones, Schwartz probably would have been amused by the inherent zaniness of the Elliott Schwartz Memorial Practice Room Project, which Carlsen presented on Saturday evening at the Conservatory. It involved commissioning nine composers to write works for up to eight pianos (most used all eight), and to have eight pianists perform them, each playing a piano in one of the eight practice rooms on the Conservatory's third floor. The audience sat, stood or milled around in the hallway, taking in the sound of the eight simultaneously played pianos.
There were logistical issues, and technological solutions. To keep eight pianists who couldn't see each other in synch, for example, Carlsen had them set the timers on their smartphones, and composers provided time-based cues in their scores.
Francis Kayali's "The Voyage of the Back Cove Fleet" proceeds from the composer's image of eight pianos as akin to a fleet, or a pod of whales, and draws on a broad variety of techniques, from clusters, to extended tremolos, to rising glissandos and even some vocalization. But its spirit is fairly gentle, and invitingly lyrical at times. Like all the works that followed, it benefited from the spatial effect of different sounds coming from rooms up and down the hallway, but as the first work on the program, it benefited most from the freshness of surround-sound effect.
Josh Jandreau's "Curving Flowers Shimmering Fire" begins with the pianists playing a single note, and expanding outward. It has an attractive dreamscape quality, and often draws on Impressionistic techniques that evoke - or at least, hint at - the sound of distant waves, or a gently rolling stream.
Harold Stover's "The Voyager Rag" covers a lot of ground, starting as it does with a 12-tone row in the bass, then toying with contrasting styles in the foreground and in the distance, in the manner of Charles Ives, and ending with full-throttle ragtime figuration that thoroughly evokes the style and its era.
Miho Sasaki provided a "chance" score, in which randomness plays a role. Each player is given a page of one of Sasaki's previous piano works, and has six minutes to play through it (while the audience listens) before all the pages are played simultaneously. For anyone who has spent time at a conservatory, it brought back memories of walking past practice rooms and taking in the cacophony of pianists working on different pieces, oblivious to what's going on in the practice rooms around them.
That was even more the case in Carlsen's "Dem ESCHART von Brunswick gewidmet," which mixes original passages based on a musical rendering of Schwartz's name, with quotations from a handful of Beethoven pieces.
Bill Matthews wrote some audience involvement into his "Aviary." The piano score weaves together Matthews' renderings of specific bird calls - seven of them, including the red-breasted morningbird, the grass-green wren and the whiskered thrush. Because the pianists played these at will (between time cues given in the score), listeners in the hallway could hear identical calls coming from the different rooms at slightly different times, in Gabrieli-like antiphony. But Matthews also posted an electronic score (also with bird calls) on Soundcloud. Listeners were given a QR code to help them access the Soundcloud recordings on their phones, and play them as part of the performance.
Joshua Descherer offered a theatrical piece, "4Ã—3 Rituals to Counteract Contrapuntal Confusion," for four pianists and four page-turners, who, rather than turning pages, undertook other activities - walking into the hallway and singing, for example, or opening and closing the practice room doors. It also offered a broader social message, its three sections moving from "Competition" to "Collaboration" to "Cooperation."
In "888" (the name evokes eight pianists playing the piano's 88 keys), Nancy Gunn provided a consonant score that gives the pianists considerable leeway in matters of repetition and tempo, but also calls for them, at one point, to make the dynamic contrasts as dramatic as possible, increasing the antiphonal effect out in the hallway.
"Psalm of These Days," by Michael Schelle, closed the program. Schelle's score is richly chromatic, and dotted with "events," including striking the strings inside the piano, shouting a word or name from a list provided in the score, and scurrying from the piano to the doorway and making eye contact with listeners. Yet the music, with its increasingly clear references to a psalm setting by Thomas Tallis, was sober and, in the final section, moving.
Musicians often say that they are trying to find fresh ways to present concerts. Here was an ingenious, purpose-built alternative approach that worked beautifully, and drew as large an audience as the space could comfortably hold.
The pianists were Melsen Carlsburg, Bridget Convey, Jesse Feinberg, George Lopez, Gulimina Mahamuti, Chiharu Naruse, Steven Pane and Jim Parakilas.

ELIZABETH WARREN AND JULIAN CASTRO ARE KINDRED SPIRITS

Texto completo: Julian Castro is finally getting the media attention he deserves. All he had to do was drop his bid for the Democratic nomination for president and stump for Elizabeth Warren.
These days, you can find the former secretary of housing and urban development telling crowds in Iowa how his former opponent would make a great commander in chief, singing Ms. Warren's praises as he schmoozes with reporters in the spin room after this week's debate, and enthusiastically tweeting that he's "ready for President Elizabeth Warren."
Ms. Warren and Mr. Castro make a good team. And - if Warren survives the boy's club of presidential politics and secures the nomination - they'd look good together on the same presidential ticket.
For one thing, Ms. Warren needs a boost with Latinos. It's no wonder why. The Massachusetts senator appears to have scarcely given that ethnic group a thought since entering politics to run for the Senate in 2012. Her constituency is highly educated, white, Northeastern liberals - and not much beyond that.
And while Mr. Castro didn't corner the market with support from fellow Latinos during the year he spent on the trail, don't be shocked if they react more fondly to him now that he's gone, and they're stuck with a field of Democratic front-runners that is as white as a snowy day in Iowa or New Hampshire.
If Warren-Castro becomes a thing, it would be the third time that Democrats went with the Massachusetts-Texas combination in a White House bid. There was John Kennedy-Lyndon Johnson in 1960, and Michael Dukakis-Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.
Sure, there are differences between the candidates. Like age; Ms. Warren is 70, Mr. Castro is 45. And then we have their relationship to the Fourth Estate; Ms. Warren is the media's preferred candidate for the White House, while Mr. Castro disappeared when he fell into the media "brown hole" (where Latinos go to vanish because they're neither black nor white). Finally, there is geography; Massachusetts and Texas seem to be on different planets.
But these two Democrats also have a few things in common. Like Harvard Law School - Ms. Warren taught there and Mr. Castro studied there. And strong communication skills - both have done a good job of exciting the base of voters that supports them, even while keeping their cool when attacked.
The diversity duo also has one more thing in common: They've both learned the hard way that, if you're not a white male, running for president is no walk in the park.
Tension comes with the territory when you're trying to be the first of anything. No one likes change, and it's not always easy to adjust to a new order of things. White men have it easy. Everyone else, not so much.
Mr. Castro was not so lucky. When he suggested decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings and treating them as civil violations, white pundits wondered aloud if the Mexican American wanted "an open border."
But women who run for president have it just as hard as people of color, if not harder. For years, I've had women friends who were Latino or African American tell me that they faced more challenges because they were women than because they were minorities.
I believe it. Women got the right to vote a half century after those African Americans who were freed slaves were allowed to cast ballots. And Americans have elected, and re-elected, an African American president. But - looking just at the major political parties - voters have twice taken a pass on electing a female vice president (Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, Sarah Palin in 2008) and once refused to elect a woman president by denying Hillary Clinton the number of electoral college votes needed to claim victory.
Now Ms. Warren is getting a taste of ignorance. In her recent kerfuffle with Bernie Sanders over a discussion they had on whether a woman could be elected president, I believe Ms. Warren. Given that Mr. Sanders has long had a burr under his saddle about so-called identity politics, I find it easy to imagine that he said that a woman would have a tough time defeating Donald Trump in 2020. Of course, that's different from what the media is reporting, that Mr. Sanders said a woman could never be elected president. Word games aside, Ms. Warren is catching a lot of flak from everyone from conservative radio hosts who hate it when someone plays the "woman card" to Sanders supporters who think their guy got played.
There we go again. Americans are always blaming the victim, and making it seem like it's the pioneer who has the problem.
Mr. Castro has been there and done that. So he's in a great position to defend Ms. Warren against what is yet another unfair attack.
Warren-Castro? Yeah, that's the ticket.

Texto completo: A Sundance favorite comes to Hulu. And a new documentary is on PBS.
What's Streaming
HONEYLAND (2019) Stream on Hulu. Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Hatidze Muratova is one of the last of her kind. She and her ailing mother are the only inhabitants of a small village in the Republic of North Macedonia, where Muratova makes a quiet living keeping bees. She practices the sustainable beekeeping methods of generations before her, like singing to her bees and making sure to only take half their honey. Then a family moves in next door, bringing with them cattle, several children, bees of their own and a threat to Muratova's way of life, and the filmmakers Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov capture a story at the intersection of modernity and tradition. "Their movie is quiet, intimate and intense, but touched with a breath of epic grandeur," A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times. "It's a poem including history."
LA STRADA (1956) Stream on Criterion. Directed by the legendary Federico Fellini, "La Strada" has been a highly regarded emblem of Italian cinema for over 60 years. It stars Giulietta Masina (Fellini's wife) as Gelsomina, a simple woman who was sold by her mother into the servitude of Zampanò, a circus strongman played by Anthony Quinn. The pair travel from town to town, with Gelsomina providing an opening act to the strongman's, until they encounter a tightrope artist who baits the strongman into violence. A comment on the innately human desire for companionship, the story is a "picaresque parable," A.H. Weiler wrote for The Times in 1956, the year the film won an Academy Award for best foreign language film.
What's on TV
ACCEPT THE CALL (2019) 10 p.m. on PBS. Yusuf Abdurahman fled civil war in Somalia in 1992. He settled in Minnesota, and he raised his son, Zacharia, in one of the largest Somali communities in the United States. In 2015, Zacharia was arrested -- along with five other Somali-Americans in Minnesota -- after an attempt to join ISIS in Syria. The filmmaker Eunice Lau tells Zacharia's story through the eyes of his father, who, in trying to understand his son's actions, unearths a harsh reality of targeted recruitment in his community and the struggles of growing up Muslim in the face of America's "war on terror."
PRODIGAL SON 9:01 p.m. on FOX. Tom Payne plays Malcolm Bright, your standard charming, wickedly intelligent N.Y.P.D. detective in this series, which is back for the rest of Season 1. The twist: Bright's estranged father, Dr. Martin Whitly (Michael Sheen), is a convicted (and imprisoned) serial killer known as the Surgeon -- and he has a copy cat. This season, Malcolm reconnected with his father to solve the murders, and the two have become a team. Now, Malcolm is being held hostage and the F.B.I. bands with the police to save him with help from Ainsley (Halston Sage) and Jessica (Bellamy Young).

Texto completo: Will Smith and Martin Lawrence led "Bad Boys for Life" to box office glory this weekend. "Dolittle" did less well.
Hollywood tried to resuscitate two bygone series this weekend. Only one came fully back to life.
Sony's "Bad Boys for Life" was far and away the top movie at domestic theaters this weekend, leaving Universal's "Dolittle" in the dust as it collected an estimated $ 59.2 million in tickets Friday through Sunday. That's just a bit less than the opening weekend "Bad Boys II" had in 2003, adjusting for inflation -- a remarkable start for a sequel being released more than 15 years later. "Bad Boys for Life" picked up an additional $ 38.6 million overseas this weekend, according to the studio.
In the new movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprise their roles as Miami buddy cops, careening through a plot that has something to do with a drug cartel. The sequel offers a plethora of jokes about aging and a great many explosions -- though conspicuously absent is the director Michael Bay, who helmed the first two "Bad Boys" movies. "Bad Boys for Life" was instead directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. It received generally favorable reviews from critics, and currently holds a 76 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. (The new directors "blow things up real good," Glenn Kenny noted in his review for The New York Times.)
[Read our critic's review of "Bad Boys for Life."]
"Bad Boys for Life" is expected to net about $ 8.9 million more in ticket sales during the Monday holiday according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. Already, the sales have been "particularly good in what continues to be an unsettled environment for sequels and remakes," David A. Gross, who runs Franchise Entertainment Research, a film consultancy, wrote in a weekend report.
Case in point: "Dolittle."
That movie, which casts Robert Downey Jr. as the titular animal-whispering veterinarian, made an estimated $ 22.5 million in ticket sales Friday through Sunday. It's expected to sell around $ 7.5 million more in tickets during the Monday holiday, but it will be a very long road to profitability: "Dolittle" cost at least $ 200 million to make and market.
Also coming well over a decade and a half after Eddie Murphy played the veterinarian in "Dr. Dolittle 2," the release of "Dolittle" on the same weekend as "Bad Boys for Life" -- and its less successful sales -- speak to audiences' inconsistent willingness to trek to theaters for sequels and reboots in the age of streaming. Poor reviews ("Dolittle" currently holds an 18 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes) probably didn't help.
"Dolittle" is grappling for second place with Universal's "1917," a World War I epic from Sam Mendes that was the top movie last weekend. "1917" brought in an estimated $ 22.1 million in sales this weekend. It will likely land in third place, just behind "Dolittle," but the order could change when final figures are calculated early this week.
Rounding out the top five were Sony's "Jumanji: The Next Level," which took in around $ 9.6 million this weekend, its sixth in theaters, and Disney's "Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker." That movie came in fifth, with about $ 8.4 million in domestic ticket sales Friday through Sunday. It was in its fifth weekend in theaters.

Barry Tuckwell, French Horn Virtuoso Who Also Conducted, Is Dead at 88

Texto completo: He was widely considered to be the finest player of his era and was said to have "inspired every generation of horn player for the past 70 years."
Barry Tuckwell, considered by many to be the finest horn player of his generation, who displayed his skill in concerts all over the world and on dozens of recordings, died on Friday in Melbourne, Australia. He was 88.
The Maryland Symphony Orchestra, of which Mr. Tuckwell was founding music director and conductor, posted news of his death on its website. The Sydney Morning Herald of Australia said the cause was heart disease.
Mr. Tuckwell, Australian by birth, was a master of the French horn, one of the more difficult instruments in the orchestra to play well, especially as a soloist. People magazine, in a 1979 article about Mr. Tuckwell, called it "some 21 feet of coiled brass, valves, crooks, sockets, slides, keys -- in short, booby traps."
Mr. Tuckwell offered an analogy. "Playing the horn," he told the magazine, "is like driving a very fast car on an oily road. You have to anticipate the things that may go wrong."
Mr. Tuckwell took up the instrument as a teenager and became principal horn of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1955. Thirteen years later he embarked on a solo career, a rare step for a horn player.
He quickly developed a reputation for both a rich tone and a dexterity with difficult passages. He also conducted, leading the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra of Australia in the early 1980s before spending 17 seasons leading the Maryland Symphony Orchestra.
"As the most recorded horn soloist of all time," the Maryland orchestra's executive director, Jonathan Parrish, said in the posting, "Tuckwell had a global impact on the world of horn playing and has inspired every generation of horn player for the past 70 years."
Edward Schneider, reviewing some new recordings by Mr. Tuckwell in 1984 in The New York Times, nodded to his eminence. The recordings included three horn duets.
"Since no other horn player is named on the label," Mr. Schneider wrote, "we must assume that, thanks to modern technology, the second horn, too, is played by Barry Tuckwell, who could not ask for a better partner."
Barry Emmanuel Tuckwell was born on March 5, 1931, in Melbourne. His father, Charles, was an organist, and his mother, Elizabeth (Norton) Tuckwell, played piano; his father and others in his extended family had perfect pitch, and so did he.
He tried his parents' instruments as well as violin before a friend introduced him to the French horn when he was 13.
"It was an important age to find something," he told People. "I was not bright academically, and I was on the verge of being a juvenile delinquent."
Two years later he was playing the instrument in the Melbourne Symphony. He also played with the Victoria and Sydney symphonies in Australia before moving to England, where he performed with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra before joining the London Symphony.
In a 1997 interview with The Times, Mr. Tuckwell credited an unexpected source with his ability to give a musical phrase a pleasing turn and to make a simple melody interesting: the jazz trombonist Tommy Dorsey.
"I played along with his records when I was a kid," he said. "I'm proud to say I took lessons from Tommy Dorsey."
As a soloist, Mr. Tuckwell played some 200 concerts a year. In 1978 he performed at Avery Fisher Hall in Manhattan during the Mostly Mozart Festival. A young man questioned him at length afterward, holding up a line of well-wishers.
"He wanted to know the secret," Mr. Tuckwell explained to a reporter who had noticed the exchange, "and there isn't any secret. It's in the head, not in the lips."
Mr. Tuckwell recorded almost everything in the classical French horn repertoire, and added to that repertoire by unearthing unknown or incomplete works for the horn, finishing those that needed finishing. But he also made efforts to push the French horn into the popular-music arena. In 1979 he and the pianist Richard Rodney Bennett recorded "A Sure Thing: Music of Jerome Kern." In 1986 came "George Shearing and Barry Tuckwell Play the Music of Cole Porter."
In 1994 he surprised the journalist Jim Lehrer and his wife, Kate, by agreeing to their out-of-the-blue request that he perform at their daughter's wedding.
"I had never played for a wedding before, but I phoned up and said, 'Why not?"' Mr. Tuckwell told The Times. "I will play the usual appropriate wedding music: the Trumpet Voluntary, the Mendelssohn 'Wedding March' and 'I've Got You Under My Skin."'
Mr. Tuckwell, who lived at various times in Australia, England and the United States, retired from performing in 1997. His final program, played in Baltimore, included Oliver Knussen's Horn Concerto, which was written for him and which he had given its premiere in Tokyo in 1994, with Mr. Knussen conducting.
Mr. Tuckwell's survivors include his fourth wife, Jenny Darling, and three children, David, Jane and Tom.
Though Mr. Tuckwell was known for making difficult musical passages look easy, he was less impressed by flashy horn playing than he was by expressiveness.
"There are a lot of people who can play loud and fast," he told The Times in 1978. "But it is still very difficult to play one note. In fact, I would like to institute a competition -- although I don't like them -- in which each participant would be asked to play only one note. The length, the dynamics would be up to the player."
"It would be a good exercise," he added, "for the judge, too."

Texto completo: At The New York Times, it's an institutional voice, but not the voice of the institution as a whole.
In an effort to shed more light on how we work, The Times is running a series of short posts explaining some of our journalistic practices. Read more from this series here.
The New York Times editorial board, established in 1896 by Adolph Ochs when he became the newspaper's publisher, is currently composed of 14 writers and editors drawn from the Times Opinion department, which also includes opinion columnists, Op-Ed editors and others.
The Opinion department is independent of the Times newsroom, with a separate mission but the same standards for fact. The first anyone in the newsroom learned of the board's editorial about the impeachment inquiry into President Trump, for instance, was when we posted it to The Times's website.
The purpose of Times Opinion is to supply the wide-ranging debate about big ideas that a diverse democracy needs. Amid that debate, the role of the editorial board is to provide Times readers with a long-range view formed not by one person's expertise and experience but ballasted by certain institutional values that have evolved across more than 150 years. That's why the editorials, unlike other articles in The Times, appear without a byline.
I've always believed that strong institutions, like strong families, are meant to transmit principles across generations; the work of The Times's editorial board has reflected the principles both of its members and of the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which has supplied the publishers who have overseen the board's work -- sometimes day to day, sometimes only on the occasion of momentous news -- for five generations.
Because the role of the editorial board can be confusing, particularly to readers who don't know The Times well, the board, in consultation with the current publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, has developed a statement of its guiding values, which include:

- Arguing for "a world that is both free and fair"
-
Supporting a world order in which "freedom and progress advance through democracy and capitalism"
- Guarding "against the excesses of those systems by promoting honest governance, civil rights, equality of opportunity, a healthy planet and a good life for society's most vulnerable members"
-
Championing "what Adolph Ochs called 'the free exercise of a sound conscience,' believing that the fearless exchange of information and ideas is the surest means of resisting tyranny and realizing human potential"

Arguing for "a world that is both free and fair"
Supporting a world order in which "freedom and progress advance through democracy and capitalism"
Guarding "against the excesses of those systems by promoting honest governance, civil rights, equality of opportunity, a healthy planet and a good life for society's most vulnerable members"
Championing "what Adolph Ochs called 'the free exercise of a sound conscience,' believing that the fearless exchange of information and ideas is the surest means of resisting tyranny and realizing human potential"
The editorial board is an institutional voice, but it is not the voice of the institution as a whole. That's a crucial distinction that often gets lost. The board doesn't speak for the newsroom. How could it? The newsroom is made up of journalists whose own opinions vary, and whose job it is to set those opinions aside in the honest pursuit and presentation of the truth.
I happened to be a White House reporter for The Times during the impeachment inquiry into Bill Clinton. The board, then under Howell Raines, supported the inquiry (though not, in the end, the impeachment). I used to read those editorials and marvel at the crackle of the prose. But the editorials certainly didn't speak for me or affect my reporting, and when the Clinton people complained to me from time to time about them, I'd just shrug and tell them to call Howell. No, I didn't know the number.
The board meets at least twice each week to debate how to address significant questions in the news in accordance with positions it has taken over the decades. In general, it reaches its conclusions by consensus, though in matters where there is deep disagreement we sometimes have to call a vote.
We try to keep in mind the big questions we've gotten wrong in the past -- such as opposing women's suffrage -- to cultivate some humility and caution. Who could know what arguments we think obvious today might be judged harshly by history.

Many people grow up never venturing beyond their own small section of their home state. Dennis Davis is not one of those people.
The Cheyenne native has worked as a newspaper reporter for the Gillette News Record, Casper Star-Tribune and the Powell Tribune, and most recently he spent 15 years teaching journalism at Northwest College. But it wasn’t just his reporting and teaching careers that brought him around the Equality State.
In September, Davis self-published the book “Wyoming – Perspectives on a 'small town with long streets',” which took him to every corner (quite literally) of Wyoming. His goal was to produce a piece about what it’s like living in the least-populous state during a time of transition in the energy industry, and after four-and-a-half years of reporting, writing and photographing, he achieved it.
“As a Wyoming native, you spend a lot of time thinking about the state, and that makes sense, having a connection to where you’re from,” he said. “Also, as a journalism teacher at Northwest College, we worked with students on story ideas around the state, and I had some sense from that that there are a ton of stories out there that aren’t necessarily in the daily headlines.”
The next step, then, was to hit the road and find them.
Before several summer road trips, Davis developed a few questions he wanted to answer through his reporting. What didn’t he already know about the state he’s called home for so long? Where could he gain some insight into who Wyomingites are and what they value? And perhaps most importantly, how are changes, particularly in the coal industry, affecting the public?
To answer these questions, he interviewed everyone from energy experts to Freedom Arms Inc. workers to a history buff he met through walking around the Smoot post office. Everyone had a unique perspective, but there were several overarching themes that emerged from the conversations.
“When we started out, I sensed we were going through a transition in how the state saw itself and in terms of its financial resources, and that’s turning out to be the case,” he said. “When I first started working on it, a lot of people said we’ve been through this boom-and-bust cycle before, it’ll all come out. This is a more fundamental kind of change, and they were reinforcing that, people I talked to, that we’re not going to come back to where we were a few years ago before bankruptcies in coal companies and things like that.”
Some of his interviews were preplanned and others were serendipitous, but the goal was always to find two or three people in every region of the state who were willing to share their thoughts. To find people in smaller areas where he had no predetermined appointments or connections, Davis said he often went to community celebrations, where he knew a large cross-section of a town would be.
“I think that reflects a lot about who we are,” he said. “And how we see ourselves and historical reflections of what a community has gone through and how that reiterates itself in the present.”
He also sought out things or places he found unusual during his reporting, such as the last drive-in movie theater in Wyoming, which happens to be in his current city of Powell, and ironically was also the first one in the whole state.
The more places he traveled to and the more people he spoke to, the more it became clear that this significant shift happening in Wyoming right now is happening a lot more rapidly than Davis initially thought.
The energy industry affects several aspects of Wyoming life, he said of why he chose to write a book on this particular topic. Energy revenues have a major influence on the job field, as well as many other broad-reaching effects on the state.
“How do we come to terms with the absence of that when we’ve come to rely on it for decades?” he said. “It’s a real alteration from the way we see ourselves and operate as a state. … It’s important for people to start thinking about what the implications are of that for the state and what kinds of decisions we need to make as we try to address those changes in the industry.”
Throughout the reporting process, Davis was also photographing his subjects, the towns he visited and the natural landforms and landscapes he said make Wyoming Wyoming. He’s made photos throughout his journalism career that have ended up in renowned publications such as the London Economist, New York Times and The Washington Post, so he had the experience he needed to create a book that is mostly photo-driven.
Although it was a big challenge to do not only his own reporting, writing and editing, but also photography, having an open mind helped him push through and get shots he never expected.
“You need to be open to possibilities, you never know what you’re going to see and what’s going to happen in front of the camera,” he said. “Some things were planned, others not, like a coyote mother moving her cubs.”
As for what he learned, Davis seemed to smile through the phone as he said this process has reinforced what a remarkable place Wyoming is.
“We have so many unique aspects to us in terms of what the landscape is and who the people are,” he said. “It takes someone kind of special to live in Wyoming and want to be here, something I had a sense of, but it was reinforced by talking to people.”

Texto completo: Sometimes I read things or see things in the newspaper and simply shake my head in disbelief. I know I am getting older, but do people really believe some of the things that come out of their mouths?
One of these moments was earlier this year, when the apparent spokesperson of the new Democratic Party, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said, “An entire generation, which is now becoming one of the largest electorates in America, came of age and never saw American prosperity. I have never seen that, or experienced it, really, in my adult life.”
That is the philosophy that drives so much of the left today. This naive view of the world. When the reality is they have never known hardship or anything but prosperity.
How else could you have a real presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, that honeymooned in the former Soviet Union and gushed over Fidel Castro? I lived in Russia just after the fall of communism. Those people could truly say they had never seen prosperity.
To top it all, however, this week we see a Bernie Sanders “field organizer,” paid staffer, caught on camera defending Stalin and his gulags. Again, I have many friends that lost family members and loved ones to Stalin’s gulags. These are real events, and Stalin is a real person that murdered millions of his own people. Those comments literally made me sick to my stomach.
The truth is, objectively, we live in the greatest time to be alive since the beginning of Earth. By virtually every objective measurement, our lives are better today than ever. A recent New York Times article written by Nicholas Kristof explained that 50 years ago, 60% of the world lived in extreme poverty. Today, for the first time ever, it is less than 10%.
According to Kristof, every single day of 2019: another 325,000 people got their first access to electricity; more than 200,000 got piped water for the first time; some 650,000 went online for the first time; and another 170,000 moved out of extreme poverty. EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.
That is great for the world, but what about right here in America. Let’s take a look: 1) average salaries are currently increasing at more than 3% annually; 2) we have the lowest overall unemployment rate in more than 50 years; 3) average income for female-led single-parent households jumped 7.6% last year; in fact, poverty rates for all people in all-female families dropped to the lowest rate for this group on record; 4) we are currently in the midst of the longest streak of monthly economic expansion in the history of the country. Again, these are just a handful of many other statistics that show how things are improving.
So, the economy is growing, but aren’t we destroying our environment in the process? No! Despite environmental fear mongering, consumption of raw materials is actually in decline. As Matt Ridley points out in his recent article in the Spectator, “We are using less stuff. If this doesn’t seem to make sense, then think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the 1970s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player, newspaper and pack of cards. LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel, and more of it is recycled. Offices are not yet paperless, but they use much less paper.”
The same holds true for all sorts of natural resources. For example, we use roughly half the water today that experts in the 1970s said we would need by the year 2000. Ridley cites a 2012 study claiming that “thanks to modern technology, we use 65% less land to produce a given quantity of food, compared with 50 years ago.” This is true, not because there are fewer people, but because human inventiveness allows us to be more efficient. We can simply do more with less.
But, let’s go back to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. The fundamental problem with their brand of liberalism is that they: 1) look at the world and only see negatives, and 2) don’t recognize that the exact thing that has led to such incredible progress is the very thing they hate – namely, capitalism. Nothing in the history of the Earth has done more to lift people out of poverty and improve humanity than free markets and capitalism.
Human ingenuity is what will continue to improve our lives and protect our environment, not centralized government power. Poverty, of course, still exists, and there are people with real problems. There is still much work to do. However, human history has taught us the path to a better life is more freedom and free markets and, alternatively, the path of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez only lead to more human suffering.
Just ask those who were actually impacted by the gulags. I have.

LegalShield offers affordable access to justice

Texto completo: For more information about LegalShield, contact local attorney Cassie Craven at 307-823-3062, or email her at ccraven.law@gmail.com.
CHEYENNE – Nowadays, instead of buying cable TV, people subscribe to streaming services such as Netflix or Hulu. This is also becoming true for their legal services.
Instead of having to pay lawyers a lofty retainer that can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $20,000 or more, people can now get quality legal help using the same model they use to stream their favorite shows. And the cost is about the same.
LegalShield is a company that provides legal assistance at a rate starting around $25 per month and varies based on if the coverage is for families, individuals or businesses. The company has been around for almost 50 years, but hasn’t had much of a presence in the Mountain West.
That’s why Network Vice President for LegalShield Patrick Manning reached out to local attorney Cassie Craven to help expand the service in this region.
“People always say that access to justice, or justice, is black and white, is always a race thing or a cultural thing,” Craven said. “In my experience as an attorney, it’s green, right? It doesn’t matter what color you are, you’re going to get the best lawyer on the street if you can afford them. You might get the best outcome if you can hire a big enough team to make it happen, but if you cannot afford that, it’s literally outside of your reach.”
The idea of paying a small monthly subscription for legal services was the brainchild of LegalShield founder Harland Stonecipher, who founded the company after he was smacked with a frivolous lawsuit after a car accident in 1969, according to the New York Times.
Stonecipher ended up settling the lawsuit, and wasn’t at fault in the accident to begin with, but due to the large legal bills he had to pay it nearly left him bankrupt, according to the newspaper. Stonecipher died in 2014, but his company lives on.
“The bedrock of our country, why people have fought and died for to protect ... was the idea that everyone has equal access,” Manning said. “And from the suffrage movement to the civil rights movement, everything that we fought for is never going to be realized if we don’t make sure that every American has access to the justice system. And they don’t have to take it on the chin.”
But LegalShield also helps with smaller problems that people tend to tolerate because the cost of hiring a lawyer is more than what they would get in return. Craven used the examples of a utility companies messing up a bill, a speeding ticket or landlord and tenant issues. Craven said she’s currently using the service to help her with a trademark issue.
Another aspect Craven said she really likes about the service is the 24/7 emergency legal assistance. For instance, if someone gets pulled over for driving under the influence, and they have their vape pen in the car, they can call the 24/7 emergency line and ask the lawyer what they should do.
Craven said having access to an attorney early on helps people practice good legal health, so small problems don’t turn into big ones.
Even though LegalShield isn’t well-known in this region, Manning said the company is at a tipping point for growth.
“There’s something to be said for a business model like LegalShield has where we actually talk to people and tell them about the services,” Manning said. “It takes a little longer to grow. But instead of spending money for advertising, LegalShield pays us to advocate for people and get them the service.”

Chief Justice Roberts must hold senators to their oath

Texto completo: As he presides over the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, Chief Justice John Roberts does not need to act like a potted plant — nor should he. In fact, Roberts as presiding officer has the ability to force senators to be true to their oath to “do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.”
Under the Senate’s standing rules, the presiding officer has the power to issue “orders, mandates, writs, and precepts,” to “direct all the forms of proceedings while the Senate is sitting for the purpose of trying and impeachment” and to “rule on all questions of evidence including, but not limited to, questions of relevancy, materiality, and redundancy of evidence.” To emphasize the limits of Roberts’ role, some commentators argue that these seemingly broad powers are actually quite constrained, because the Senate majority retains the power to overrule Roberts.
But that does not make the chief justice’s role a nullity. Certainly, were Roberts to rule to admit evidence at the request of the House managers, a Republican senator could object and request a vote. With their majority in the Senate, the Republicans could easily prevail and have evidence excluded. Because the Senate has the final word in impeachment, the House managers have no ability to appeal — at least not to a higher court. But imagine how such a move would influence the proceeding. Would Republican senators really want to demonstrate such unprecedented partisanship, overruling the conservative, Republican-appointed chief justice and lending credence to assertions that they are running a rigged trial and burying relevant evidence?
Roberts has attempted, at times, to position the administration of justice and the role of the judiciary as being above the fray of partisan politics. That desire argues for a more assertive role from the chief justice at the impeachment trial, not less. Now more than ever, Roberts must live up to his own vision of dispensing justice by ruling to admit evidence that will advance the goal of seeking the truth.
In doing so, he would be playing a familiar and impartial role one for which he is well suited. During ordinary court proceedings, judges determine whether evidence is admissible based on whether it is relevant and important to the consideration of the legal issues; they determine whether evidence should be excluded because, for example, it is privileged or unduly prejudicial.
The chief justice as presiding officer should follow such standards in determining how to rule on any demands to admit evidence, allow witnesses to testify or obtain documents. To take one potential example, the president has said he would seek to assert executive privilege to prevent former national security adviser John Bolton from testifying, “for the sake of the office.”The chief justice would seemingly be well situated to determine in the first instance whether and how executive privilege applies in the setting of an impeachment trial.
It would be interesting to see how Republican senators would respond to a ruling by the chief justice that they consider adverse to the president’s interests. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has shown no compunction about stating that he does not want witnesses to testify, a stance at odds with his argument in the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.
“It’s not unusual to have a witness in a trial. It’s certainly not unusual to have a witness in an impeachment trial,” McConnell said then, calling a request for three witnesses a “modest” number. Indeed, there has never been an impeachment trial that reached a verdict — for a president or a lesser officer — without witnesses.
But for other Republican senators, especially those facing difficult reelection campaigns, voting to overturn a decision by the chief justice might be a daunting prospect — and rightfully so. As Republican former Rep. Thomas Campbell, who sat on the House Judiciary Committee during the Clinton impeachment, put it in the New York Times, “How would a senator feel about overruling a judgment on the merits by the chief justice? I think ‘hesitant’ would be the adjective I’d use.”
Those of us who believe the Constitution requires a fair trial — that the Senate oath to uphold “impartial justice” is not meaningless verbiage — must hope that “hesitant” will not be the word historians will use to describe how the chief justice performed his role. Doing little would be ducking his constitutional responsibility, not fulfilling it.

Texto completo: J. Charles Jones, a civil rights activist both in Charlotte, North Carolina, and nationally who helped organize pivotal events and groups in the 1960s, died on Friday, Dec. 27, 2019, at his home in Charlotte. He was 82.
His son Michael said the causes were Alzheimer's disease and sepsis.
Jones, who came from a family of ministers, was a seminary student at Johnson C. Smith University of Charlotte in early February 1960 when he heard on the radio that four Black men had staged a sit-in at a segregated Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, 90 miles to the northeast.
He had been tracking the emerging Civil Rights Movement throughout the 1950s and saw Greensboro as his personal call to action. At a meeting of his university's student council on Feb. 8, he and a few others announced that they intended to challenge the segregation at the Charlotte Woolworth's the next day. They thought a handful of fellow students might join them.
"The next morning there were 216 students outside the administration building," Jones said in an oral history recorded in 2005 for Miami University of Ohio. "And we all went downtown in various forms and sat at every lunch counter there."
Jones became a spokesman for that protest, one of a number that sprang up across the South; it resulted in the desegregation of many Charlotte lunch counters that summer.
In April 1960 Jones participated in the meeting at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina, that resulted in the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The next year Jones was one of four people the group sent to Rock Hill, South Carolina, in support of the so-called Rock Hill Nine, who had already been arrested after protesting a segregated lunch counter and had chosen to go to jail and do 30 days on a chain gang rather than post bail - a strategy, known as "Jail, No Bail," that embarrassed segregationists.
Jones and the three other SNCC members were also arrested, and Jones did his own 30 days.
"Among other things, we made concrete drain pipes and laid them in places where my grandfather, A.A. Jones, had established churches, two churches," Jones said in an oral history recorded in 1993 for the Duke University Libraries. "And I felt the culture."
Later in the 1960s, while a student at Howard University's law school, where he earned a law degree in 1966, Jones helped form the Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs, known as Access. In June 1966 he led a small group of marchers who, over four days, walked the entire length of the recently completed Washington Beltway, the 64-mile-long highway that encircles the city, to call attention to the problem of suburban landlords who would not rent to Black people.
In his later years Jones would often give talks on the Civil Rights Movement and participate in reunions marking the history-making moments he had experienced firsthand.
"History flowed through Charles Jones," Tom Hanchett, historian in residence at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library, said by email. "He seldom spoke without invoking The Elders, the previous generations who had gotten us here and demanded that we keep moving forward. He wanted you to know the civil rights history that his generation had made - so that you would pick up the torch, in turn, and make history yourself."
Joseph Charles Jones was born on Aug. 23, 1937, in Chester, South Carolina. His father, J.T., was a Presbyterian minister, and his mother, lone (Elston) Jones, was an English teacher.
Charles Jones often spoke proudly of the emphasis on education in his family, something he took to heart early. The schoolhouse in Chester, he said, was right across the street from where he lived, and at age 5 he decided he was ready for first grade, although the age requirement was 6.
"So I went on over and took a couple of books and said, 'I'm ready for school,"' he recalled. The teacher, a Miss Cassell, was amused.
"She said to my mother, 'Well, it was kind of funny, because Charlie came in,"' Jones recalled - and one of the books he had brought was "What All Young Expectant Mothers Should Know."
Miss Cassell let him stay anyway, and for the rest of his education he was a year ahead of his age group.
The family moved to Charlotte in 1947. Jones earned an undergraduate degree at Johnson C. Smith University in 1958 and pursued theological studies before devoting himself full time to civil rights causes and then switching to a legal career.
In its early days the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee debated whether it should emphasize protests or less flashy means of change, like voter registration. In 1961 Jones became head of the group's voter registration wing. Leaving school that summer, he did organizing work in Albany, Georgia, and McComb, Mississippi, among other places. He was arrested several more times.
Later in the 1960s, a high point of Jones' work with the Access group was persuading Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to meet with him in the aftermath of the Beltway march. He asked the secretary to bring pressure on suburban landlords near military bases, since so many of the soldiers fighting in Vietnam were Black. In June 1967 McNamara banned members of the military from renting at any segregated apartment complex near Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, a major military hub.
Jones' first marriage, to Marian Irving, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Joanne Vasco. In addition to his son Michael, from his first marriage, he is survived by his wife, Jackie (Blackwell) Jones; a son, Joseph Charles Jr., and daughter, Ireti Jones Burrell, from his second marriage; and four grandchildren.

Texto completo: Headnote Familiar first-round opponents at Australian Open
MELBOURNE, Australia - In only her third Grand Slam event, Coco Gauff has challenges lined up that will already be familiar to her, as revealed in the Australian Open draw. Gauff, will in the first
Gauff, 15, will open in the first round Monday against seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams, 39, as she did in the first round of Wimbledon last year.
Gauff, then ranked outside the Top 300, became an international sensation by beating Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion, 6-4, 6-4. Gauff backed up the win with a run to the fourth round, where she lost to the eventual champion, Simona Halep.
Williams has pulled out of Australian lead-up tournaments this month in Brisbane and Adelaide, citing a hip injury, but she has been training in Melbourne this week.
Should Gauff advance to the third round in Melbourne, she could go up against defending champion Naomi Osaka, seeded third here. She faced Osaka in the third round of last year's U.S. Open, where Osaka was also the defending champion. Osaka won that meeting, 6-3, 6-0, and consoled a despondent Gauff at the net after match point, creating one of the tournament's most celebrated moments of sportsmanship.
Gauff's star-studded section is part of a cluster of tough opponents in her quarter. Two seeded Americans, the 14th-seeded Sofia Kenin and the 24th-seeded Sloane Stephens, await as possible fourth-round opponents for whoever advances through that section.
The eighth-seeded Serena Williams, who is seeking a record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title here, awaits as a possible quarterfinal opponent.
Williams was dealt a favorable path in the first week of the tournament, opening against 90th-ranked Anastasia Potapova, then facing 69th-ranked Tamara Zidansek or 177th-ranked Han Na-lae in the second round.
Caroline Wozniacki, the former WTA No. 1 who has announced she is playing her final tournament here before retiring, is a possible fourthround opponent for Serena Williams. Wozniacki opens against the American Kristie Ahn.
Top-seeded Ashleigh Barty leads the top half of the draw, which includes all of the aforementioned players. She opens against 120th-ranked Lesia Tsurenko. The seventh-seeded Petra Kvitova, the runner-up here last year to Osaka, is also in her quarter of the draw.
The bottom half of the women's draw is anchored by the second-seeded Karolina Pliskova, who won the prestigious lead-up tournament in Brisbane last week. Pliskova has a tricky opening match against the 39th-ranked Kristina Mladenovic, to whom she has lost two of four matches. The bottom half of the draw also features the fourth-seeded Halep, the fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina and the sixth-seeded Belinda Bencic.
The men's draw has a seemingly more even distribution of contenders. Top-seeded Rafael Nadal, who would tie Roger Federer for the alltime men's lead with a 20th Grand Slam title here, opens against the 72nd-ranked Hugo Dellien of Bolivia.
Nadal has an eye-catching possible fourth-round match against Nick Kyrgios, the flashy Australian who has won two of his three meetings with Nadal on hard courts. In the quarterfinals, Nadal could face the fifth-seeded Dominic Thiem, whom he has beaten in the French Open final each of the last two years.
Frances Tiafoe, the ebullient American who broke through to a quarter- final run here last year, was dealt one of the toughest draws, having to open against the fourth-seeded Daniil Medvedev, the second-highest seed in Nadal's half. Medvedev, who pushed Nadal to five sets in last year's U.S. Open final, could face the 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka in the fourth round, and the seventh-seeded Alexander Zverev in the quarterfinals.
On the bottom half of the draw, third-seeded Federer opens against the American Steve Johnson, ranked 81st. The seeded player he could face in the third round is the 31st-seeded Hubert Hurkacz, a lanky Pole who improved his ranking by 50 spots last season.
Federer could face 18th-seeded Grigor Dimitrov, who beat him in the U.S. Open quarterfinals last year, in the fourth round, and the eighth-seeded Matteo Berrettini in the quarterfinals.
The last quarter of the men's draw is anchored by seven-time champion Novak Djokovic, who is seeded second. Djokovic was dealt one of the toughest opening rounds, against 37th-ranked Jan-Lennard Struff, a tall and powerful German whom Djokovic beat in the fourth round of last year's French Open.
The tournament's director, Craig Tiley, on Thursday addressed players' concerns about the smoke from Australia's ongoing wildfires, which delayed play during qualifying matches on Tuesday and Wednesday. Tiley said play would be suspended if the air quality index, which measures the pollutants known as PM 2.5, exceeded 200, as it did on Wednesday.
Before the draw was made on Thursday, local hopes were dealt a blow with the withdrawal of the top Australian male player, the 21st-ranked Alex de Minaur, who withdrew due to an abdominal tear he suffered during the ATP Cup last week while playing for the Australian team.
De Minaur admitted he may have been swept up by the patriotic fervor stoked in the new national team event, pushing through pain that he started feeling in his second of five matches, and jeopardizing his chances of playing his country's premier tournament, where he reached the third round last year.
"Playing for your country, it's a different feeling: I'm going to do everything to leave it all out there," de Minaur said. "It looks like, this time, that's sort of pushed me back for a bit."

Texto completo: Yes, like numerous other people across the civilized world, I was oddly surprised but not really shocked to hear that Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his American-born wife, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, have decided to pretty much call it quits on the royalty thing.
Many other observers were far more upset. Suddenly Brexit, the American presidential race and the lethal tensions between the United States and Iran had to compete for our attention against the breaking news posted by the royal couple on an elegant new website: Harry and Meg will "step back as 'senior' members" of the royal family and work to "carve out a progressive new role" in the family and work to become "financially independent."
The British tabloid press, seldom a friend to the couple's privacy or dignity, pounced on the news like wolves on a lamb chop, erupting with such colorful and even overwrought descriptions as "selfish," "rogue royals," "a seismic shock" and "an atrocious lapse of judgment."
I saw that coming. Although Queen Elizabeth II and the rest of the royal family showed as much enthusiasm in public as Britain's reserved culture and traditions would allow, the tabloids didn't hold back.
"Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton," the Daily Mail blared in 2016, citing the Los Angeles neighborhood of Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland. In 2017, Rupert Murdoch's Sun apologized for a 2016 story with the misleading headline, "Harry's girl on Pornhub." Even worse was the BBC host who compared the couple's newborn baby to "a chimp." Not nice.
But not every Brit was in a snit.
"If the media paid more attention to Britain's communities of color," wrote Black British journalist Afua Hirsch in a New York Times op-ed, "perhaps it would find the announcement far less surprising."
Indeed Hirsch, author of the award-winning book, "Brit(ish): On Race, Identity and Belonging," and currently teaching journalism at the University of Southern California, describes a Britain of rising interracial and interethnic tensions amid debates over Brexit, immigration, native nationalism and the nature of the glue that holds a society together.
I've seen this before. I worked temporarily in the Chicago Tribune's London bureau in the mid-1970s, at a time when "Paki-bashing," street violence by skinhead thugs against immigrants of color, mostly from South Asia, was making the sort of headlines that the crack epidemic made here in the 1980s.
It's not a headline for Great Britain alone. Today we see xenophobia toward immigrants rising across Europe, partly in response to mass migration by refugees from the Middle East. Tolerance for diversity is like the weather. It rises or retreats depending on atmospheric conditions, particularly the political atmosphere.
It was against that backdrop that the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex seemed like a much-needed breath of fresh air, much like President Barack Obama's election added new energy to hopes for peace on earth and opportunities for all, regardless of race, religion or ethnicity. Remember those days?
Alas, politics got in the way. For everyone who saw new possibilities in Obama's themes of "hope" and "change," there were other people who saw the dangerous possibilities of their opportunities closing. A lot of us who cheered Obama's victory as a new day for peace and brotherhood got a wake-up call when Donald Trump, whose campaign leaned on those same fears of immigrants and job-threatening automation and trade policies, pulled off a surprising victory in the Electoral College.
It was a surprising victory even for journos like me who had been writing about those job and displacement issues for years. That only underscores the value of paying attention, even in times of great victories, to those who are not cheering.

Texto completo: NEW ORLEANS - A misdemeanor simple battery warrant has been issued for Cleveland Browns wide receiver and former LSU star Odell Beckham Jr., police in New Orleans said Thursday.
The warrant comes as video posted on social media appears to show Beckham swatting a security officer's buttocks during LSU's locker room victory celebration after. Monday night's college national championship game in the Superdome.
"We are aware of the incident and have been in touch with Odell and his representatives on the matter," the Browns said in a statement. "They are cooperating with authorities to appropriately address the situation."
LSU players were seen smoking cigars - forbidden in the Superdome - in pictures from the Monday night celebration. Authorities reportedly warned them they could face arrest.
In a 27-second video available on Twitter, a security officer is seen standing over an LSU player sitting on a locker room bench. The officer appears to be searching around the bench and pointing to the floor. He can be heard talking about a "burn mark" just before Beckham approaches him from behind and appears to swat his backside.
The arrest warrant follows another post-game controversy involving Beckham.
LSU has acknowledged contacting officials from the NCAA and Southeastern Conference about Beckham apparently handing out cash to Tigers players on the field after the national championship game.
LSU athletics spokesman Michael Bonnette said initial information suggested that Beckham handed out "novelty bills" to players after LSU defeated Clemson on Monday night. However, further investigation showed that Beckham may have given away real money, Bonnette said last week.
"We were in contact with the NCAA and the SEC immediately upon learning of this situation in which some of our student-athletes may have been placed in a compromising position," Bonnette said.
Beckham, who is from New Orleans, had an interesting first season with the Browns, who acquired him in March from the New York Giants in a blockbuster trade.
The 27-year-old threetime Pro Bowler skipped most of the team's preseason training camp and his absence may have contributed to him seeming to be out of sync with quarterback Baker Mayfield.
Beckham played most of the season with a sports hernia injury that may require surgery. Despite not being completely healthy, he still played in all 16 games and finished with 74 catches for 1,035 yards. However, he had just four touchdowns, his fewest in a full season.
The flashy wide receiver was fined by the NFL for wearing an expensive watch during a game and was asked by officials to change his helmet visor as well as cleats that did not conform to league rules.
Late in the season, as the Browns were falling from playoff contention, Beckham dismissed reports he was telling opposing players to "come get me" during games. Beckham said he had no intention of leaving the Browns and was committed to helping them win while playing alongside Jarvis Landry, his best friend and former college teammate.

Black Trump supporters say he wins on jobs

Texto completo: Headnote 'WE'RE NOT BEING HEARD'
Passing by First Immanuel Baptist Church on Thursday night, lifelong Philadelphian Abdul Byrd said he's no fan of President Donald Trump.
"My personal opinion is, I dislike how he's running the country right now," Byrd said. "And I can't wait till he out of office."
Inside the North Philly church on that evening, the sentiment was opposite.
About 60 mostly Black and Brown people were gathered there to show their support for the president at an event organized by his campaign's Black Voices for Trump initiative.
"You're in a safe place tonight," began First Immanuel senior pastor Todd Johnson. "You're in a good place tonight. And you're in a place tonight where if you wanna say we're gonna make Philadelphia great again, we're gonna make Pennsylvania great again, and we're gonna make America great again - you can say that."
People came from as far away as the Bronx and as close as 10th and Master to hear conservative commentator Paris Dennard and co-panelist Kamilah Prince, the Black engagement director for the Republican National Committee, talk about Donald Trump.
The meeting also offered tips on how best to engage neighbors with pro-Trump outreach.
Boisterous applause met various talking points, like mention of a bill Trump signed to restore funding to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, or the historically low U.S. unemployment rate.
In the 2016 election, Trump earned just 8% of the vote in Philadelphia.
But in a city that's been run by Democratic politicians for generations, where gun violence has reached decade highs, where school buildings are toxic and neighbors feel they're being displaced by gentrification, some residents said they think it's time for a change.
'What he can say is a bit crazy/ but policies draw support
Community organizer and former Democratic City Council candidate Sheila Armstrong was in attendance.
"In my community where we are oppressed, we're not being heard," said Armstrong, 43, who lives in a Philadelphia Housing Authority development in North Philadelphia. "I left the Democratic Party because I realized they did not want change. They wanted our community, my community... to stay oppressed."
Natasha Davis, a social worker from Sicklerville, N.J., who identified as biracial, said she switched parties when she noticed the economy improving in her neighborhood.
"I feel like the jobs are opening up," Davis said. "The jobs are opening up more doors for a lot of people, especially minorities."
Pastor Johnson, 56, is a lifelong Republican. He's staunchly anti-abortion, and said he likes Trump's approach to funding the military and law enforcement.
Trump's presidency has been imbued by offensive remarks that play on racist stereotypes. He has called Haiti a "sh-hole country," and referred to Baltimore as "disgusting, rat and rodent infested." He's also repeatedly failed to condemn white supremacy, like when he insisted there was "blame on both sides" of the attack during a Charlottesville, Virginia, rally that left one woman dead.
But the president's Black supporters say his policies don't reflect this rhetoric.
To a person, Dennard, Armstrong, Johnson and Davis said it's Trump's actions, not his words, that have garnered their support.
"What he can say is a bit crazy," said 32-year-old Davis, "but at the same time, it's like, what has he actually brought he's brought to the table."
When he's engaging neighbors at the barbershop, Johnson said he challenges the assertion that Trump is racist. "If he is a racist, then he's the worst racist in America because there are more African-American people working now than ever in the history of our economy," Johnson said.
A longtime role model for the Black community
Trump's embrace by some in the Black community is not new.
Long before he emerged as a viable potential president, but long after he took out full page ads in The New York Times calling for the executions of five young African-American boys falsely accused of rape and assault, Trump received shoutouts from Black hiphop artists and other Black celebs.
"Bill Gates, Donald Trump, let me in, now!" rapper Nelly sang on his break-out hit, "Country Grammar," praising Trump's wealth.
"I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card," Big Sean rapped in his 2017 song "Light," referencing his own trajectory in relation to Trump's successful career.
And in his song "Incarcerated Scarfaces" Wu-Tang Clan rapper Raekwon calls himself the "Black Trump," in reference to his own streetstyle business savvy.
Session panelist Dennard, a Phoenix native who last visited Philly 20 years ago when he gave a speech at the Republican National Convention, said Trump's success is aspirational.
"I remember watching... Donald Trump the mogul, the entertainer, the real estate investor, the businessman," said the 37-year-old commentator. "There was a time when President Donald Trump was very connected to the culture and to the identity of what it means to achieve the American dream."
It remains unclear whether Trump can translate his admired, if questionable, business acumen into political support from Philly's large African-American population. That didn't happen in 2016, when Hillary Clinton won 82% of the vote, claiming victory in every majority-Black ward in the city.
Election analysts note, however, that fewer Black Philadelphians voted in 2016 than in 2012.
Nationwide, the Black electorate wasn't feeling Trump either. Just 8% of Black people voted for him, including just 3% of non-college educated and 6% of college educated Black women. He had a 10% approval rating among Black Americans at the end of 2019, according to Gallup.
At First Immanuel on Thursday, there were shouts of "amen," lots of applause, and plenty of affirmative grunts.
Before folks left the Black Voices for Trump event, they gathered for a group pic. An enthusiastic "Four more years!" chant erupted from the front of the sanctuary.
Byrd, who didn't attend the event, isn't convinced.
"I don't think he going to win Philadelphia," offered Byrd, adding, "[But] he'll probably win Pennsylvania."

Texto completo: Imagine your level of indignation as you leave church after listening to the minister cite Bible verses and promise a rain of fire and brimstone during his sermon on the spiritual perils of infidelity.

And then you see him leave through the back door of the sanctuary with his mistress.

Watch your incredulity spike from a gentle simmer to a raging boil after having a nutrition expert wag a finger of guilt in everyone else's direction during a seminar on the virtues and merits of the vegan diet they are selling. And then you find out they are hosting a hog roast that weekend.

Restrain your compelling urge to scream and push the veins in your neck to the point of bursting through the skin as you hear a politician prattle on about how they are fighting wasteful government spending, but their voting record on pork-barrel projects makes the mythical drunken sailor look frugal.

More than a few people reach that same level of anger and exasperation each time there is a Hollywood gala and a few of the thespians from the theater of self-importance decide it is their obligation to preach to the unwashed masses on the looming disaster titled man-caused climate change.

Many of the world leaders who will assemble in Davos, Switzerland, for the World Economic Forum meeting this week will follow the same script - talking down to the peasantry about how droughts, floods, and hurricanes are the direct result of your lives accelerating carbon-fed climate change, so we must immediately fund a folder full of government would-be solutions, turn off the air conditioner, and drive Smart Fortwo microcars. Then they fly home in private jets.

The climate changes - there is no disputing that piece of the history of our planet.

The area we live in was once covered by a mile-thick of ice, just 10,000 years ago. Then it melted.

Further back in our geologic history, the same region was part of a vast, warm sea - the fossil park in Sylvania holds evidence of that era. But at some point, the sea was gone. The climate changed dramatically.

It is best we leave the debate over the level of climate change the planet is experiencing currently and its causes and potential repercussions to the scientific community, but not one where any soul that raises a question or points out flawed data is cast from the temple as a heretic.

Science isn't a democracy where a plurality proves a theory or a domain where name-calling wins the day. It is also not a cult where everyone must have an identical opinion, or be hurled off the cliff as a denier.

Our climate changes, and it is very likely undergoing some level of change right now, but just as we have responded to the threats of deadly disease, industrial pollution, and the potential of nuclear winter, we should remain optimistic that the motivation of self-preservation will take us to the correct action in this case.

What irritates many in the 21st-century bourgeoisie is the climate around the climate change chronicles.

They too love the planet, but thinking people can't help but retch at the seemingly immeasurable level of hypocrisy raining down on us from the Hollywood crowd, the any-soapbox-will-do political flock, and some of our most revered leaders.

Going back to church for a moment - they have no interest in practicing what they feel so strongly compelled to preach.

Exhibit A, from the recent Golden Globes awards show: hundreds of stars arrived at the gala in 8 miles per gallon limousines, with a few Bentleys that get 12 mpg, and a Rolls Royce that achieves even less than that.

They then risked certain compound fractures by endlessly patting themselves on the back for their plant-based dinner, but even the New York Times felt it necessary to painfully point out that while the meal was celebrated as green, the huge ballroom was garlanded with flowers that had to be flown in from Italy and Ecuador.

We can only assume that Tom Steyer is still calculating the carbon belch those long-distance excesses produced.

You can't live in energy-sucking mansions, fly private jets to Tahiti or St. Barts or the Cannes Film Festival, and go back to eating foie gras and Wagyu beef the day after the awards show, and claim you are doing your part to fight climate change.

Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most passionate apostles espousing the theology of climate change, but as Forbes pointed out, you don't take private jets to the Alps, the French Riviera, Tokyo, and Brazil, and charter one of the largest yachts in the world for your vacations, and then say we need to work collectively to combat climate change, as he did in an Oscar acceptance speech.

Exhibit B: When former Vice President Al Gore was at the summit of his ascension into a self-appointed role as protector of the planet, his 10,000-square-foot mega home in Nashville was consuming electricity at 12 times the rate of the average house in the area, according to the Associated Press.

That glaring inconsistency made it difficult for some to digest his doomsday polar bear scenario since his lifestyle seemed a much bigger threat to those Arctic bruins than that of most Americans.

Exhibit C: Former President Obama is a smart and well-read guy and a very convincing speaker.

He championed climate change as one of the most critical issues of our time. If we don't do anything on the climate issue, all bets are off, President Obama told Pacific Islanders while predicting doom for the residents of Kiribati and Fiji as rising seas would envelop their homes. Then he and his wife, Michelle, bought a $15 million beachfront estate in Martha's Vineyard that sits just a few feet above sea level. As in the case of the mythical minister, the sermon didn't match the post-sermon action.

We live in a free country, and people can make their own decisions on air travel, less-than-humble seaside accommodations, yacht rentals, and luxury rides.

But when there are hundreds of gas-gulping limousines lined up outside the Hollywood self-congratulatory session, and the party-goers used 100 private jets to reach that party, their calls for action to combat climate change seem like just another well-rehearsed scene in a less than convincing performance.

If you don't live it, you probably shouldn't preach it.

It's Trump's fault he can't get Soleimani bump

Texto completo: President Donald Trump has sought political profit from targeted killing. His reelection campaign has run hundreds of social media ads praising the attack on Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani. In October, after he announced the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the campaign quickly produced a video that bragged about "obliterating ISIS."
Although his blood-dimmed appeals have generated campaign money, they have had a weak impact on the general public. His approval rating remains anemic.
Why has he failed to get the "rally effect" that boosted previous presidents after foreign crises? For all his complaints about Democrats and the news media, the blame is in Trump's own hands. Years of tweets and public statements have completely undercut his message.
President Barack Obama saw his approval rating jump six points after a successful raid against 9/11 architect Osama bin Laden. The effect did not last long, however, in part because critics such as Trump urged Americans to deny credit to their president.
In December 2011, Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer: "I keep hearing about, oh, bin Laden, the military did an incredible job and they called and they said, we have him. And he said, go get him. What's he going to say, don't get him? And he gets all this credit? It's a lot of crap."
In October 2012, Trump was still at it: "Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden."
And bin Laden was a far more familiar figure than Trump's recent targets. Before last autumn, few Americans knew who Soleimani and al-Baghdadi were, and Trump showed little interest in rallying the public against them.
In a 2015 interview with Hugh Hewitt, Trump acknowledged his own ignorance. Hewitt mentioned their names, asking: "Do you know the players without a scorecard, yet, Donald Trump?' He responded: "No, you know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll be all gone."
Hewitt's questioning annoyed Trump, who then tweeted: "Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more – typical 'gotcha' questions."
The following year, Bret Baier of Fox News asked: "So if we took out al-Baghdadi, would you say that decapitation would kill ISIS or another leader would just pop up?" This time, Trump did not object to the question but belittled the value of killing evil leaders. "No. No," he said "another leader would pop up. I think it's been proven."
Trump seldom if ever mentioned al-Baghdadi or Soleimani on the campaign trail, and the pattern continued into his presidency.
In a 2017 tweet, he falsely claimed that The New York Times had published information that foiled al-Baghdadi's capture. Trump briefly uttered al-Baghdadi's name during his 2018 State of the Union address, but as a way to fault previous administrations. "In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield – including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi," he said.
The claim was misleading. After al-Baghdadi was in American custody in 2004, the United States handed him over to Iraqi authorities.
That was about it. Between January 2017 and October 2019, Trump talked and tweeted far more about Hillary Clinton than about the men whose deaths he would order. When he did discuss the killings, he stepped on his own story.
With al-Baghdadi, he staged a meandering news conference full of tangents and dubious claims, such as his insistence that al-Baghdadi wept before he died. With Soleimani, he bungled any chance for national unity by making a harsh, inaccurate and unnecessary attack on Obama's Iran policy.
In a USA TODAY/Ipsos poll, a plurality of respondents said Trump ordered the killing of Soleimani to distract attention from his impeachment. Why would they believe such a ghastly thing? For one thing, Trump had encouraged them to think that way.
In 2011, he tweeted: "In order to get elected, @BarackObama will start a war with Iran." In a YouTube video, he said: "Our president will start a war with Iran because he has absolutely no ability to negotiate. ... So I believe that he will attack Iran sometime prior to the election, because he thinks that's the only way he can get elected."
Trump has told thousands of lies and openly disparaged the intelligence community. It is no surprise that so many people now doubt him when he says that the targeted killing thwarted an imminent threat. It's as if he spent the past decade making sure that Americans would distrust him at this very moment.
Here is the worst part: Future presidents will need the public to believe them in times of peril, and Trump's record will make their job much harder.

Texto completo: Cold, snowy weather lends itself to bus or train commutes. Instead of white-knuckling your way along an icy freeway, you are in a warm place with plenty of time to read. So here is an array of books, new in paperback, to tuck into your backpack for your daily journey. Don't dread the commute -- enjoy it. And don't forget to thank your bus driver.
"The House of Mirth," by Edith Wharton. (Scribner, $19.) OK, I can't fool you; this isn't new -- it was first published in 1905 -- but this edition with a new introduction by novelist Jennifer Egan just came out last week. Two Pulitzer Prize winners between the same covers! (Wharton was the first woman to win the prize, for "The Age of Innocence." Egan won in 2011 for "A Visit From the Goon Squad.") "The House of Mirth" is the devastating story of the downfall of Lily Bart, a well-born but impoverished young woman in 19th-century New York. She falls in love with a young attorney but refuses to marry him because he is not wealthy. And she passes up subsequent proposals, always thinking she can do better -- until it is too late.
"Suitable Accommodations: The Letters of J.F. Powers 1942-1963." (Picador, $20.) The author of "Morte D'Urban," which won the National Book Award, J.F. Powers spent much of his adult life looking for "suitable accommodations" for himself, his wife and their five children, bouncing among various homes in Minnesota and Ireland. In this collection of letters and journal entries, edited by his oldest daughter, Katherine A. Powers (whose name you might recognize from reviews on this page, and her monthly audiobooks column), Powers writes about how cranky he was about his family life taking away from his writing time, and how he preferred not to have to earn money any other way. "Should a giraffe have to dig dandelions or a worm fly a kite?" The book opens in 1944, when Powers is serving time in prison in Minnesota for refusing induction into the military. "A while ago I saw somebody playing with a small snake," he writes. "I guess it will die eventually. It can't get out, either." It ends after his book wins the National Book Award but fails to make him rich.
"The Street," by Ann Petry. (Mariner Books, $15.95.) Originally published in 1946, "The Street" was the first novel by an African-American woman to sell more than a million copies. That alone should pique your interest. The story takes place in Harlem, tracing the lives of Lutie Johnson, a newly single mother struggling to make a living, and her son, Bub. The book is laced with "shrewd social commentary about the relentless nature of poverty and its effect on black women in particular," Tayari Jones writes in her introduction to this reissue. "She addresses stereotypes one by one and crushes them underfoot."
"Cheer Up, Mr. Widdicombe," by Evan James. (Washington Square Press, $16.) The neurotic Widdicombe family spends its summer on Bainbridge Island outside of Seattle in this hilarious satire of New Age angst and goofiness. I'll say no more, other than urge you to read it. It's good to laugh out loud in dark, cold January, even on the bus.
"Churchill: Walking With Destiny," by Andrew Roberts. (Penguin, $24.) At 1,000 pages and 2½ pounds, this book admittedly barely qualifies as a paperback. (The hardcover is a full pound heavier.) But it's a fascinating, well researched and well written read. This one-volume biography of one of the greatest men of the 20th century was named a best book of the year by the New York Times, the Economist and the Wall Street Journal. It will surely last your commutes for the whole year.

Texto completo: We may not fully appreciate how intelligent, forward thinking and articulate our forefathers were (some liberals think there may have been five or six of them). There was a lot of discussions, squabbling and arguing when they designed our Constitution and Amendments, but they got it right on every part. One important part is The Electoral College.
Every vote is counted equally. It has only occurred three times in history where the Electoral College came into play over the popular vote. The first one when Lincoln became President in 1860. The second when Bush became President over Gore and the third when Trump became President over Clinton. Our country is blessed, and we need to be thankful for what and how our forefathers had artfully designed our Constitution.
Donald Trump may not be perfect, but he is certainly looking out for the best interest for Americans and our great country.
Biden said the liberals don't care about the facts or truth. The Democrats are not used to someone standing up for the facts. It doesn't seem to matter how much they degrade and ridicule him, he just keeps going on doing what is best for the American people and America.
The left appears to have so much hate that they do not want to see any of the positives this great President has done not only for America but for Americans. He is the primary reason people have been able to get above the poverty level and off food stamps. The left condemns this, and it appears they do not want Americans to do well and get upset when they do.
The more they can keep people suppressed the better they like it. It gives them more power which is what they crave. They have made it in life, and they don't want people to get off unemployment or food stamps because that gives them less control. It's hard to imagine that kind of hate for their fellow Americans.
Darrell Brechbill, Chambersburg
Governor didn't keep promise I would like to thank Dwight Weidman for the article (Jan. 12) he wrote on property taxes. We elect officials on the promises they make while they campaign, but once elected they fail to follow up on them. Our Governor is one of them. I am ashamed to say I voted for him the first time.
Barry Hockenberry, Doylesburg
An open letter to Rep. John Joyce In your Johnstown Op Ed of February 12, 2019, you stated that you were "not interested in waiting around for the typical political processes and posturing to play out." I'm wondering now why you are doing exactly that regarding impeachment and war powers.
On November 12, 2019, you state this on your .gov website: "The impeachment process is based on heresay." Nevertheless, you have yet to demand testimony from those with first-hand knowledge of the Ukraine issue. Where has your voice been regarding White House-blocked witnesses such as John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney? If you don't want heresay, why didn't you demand first-hand testimony?
Now you have voted against the House War Powers Resolution. To date, no imminent Iranian attack has been confirmed. On January 12, 2020, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper stated on Face the Nation "I didn't see one [specific evidence of an Iranian attack] with regard to four embassies." GOP Senator Mike Lee states in the January 12 New York Times that he was "'worried' about the quality of the information that national security officials were sharing with Congress and had not 'been able to yet ascertain specific details of the imminence of the attack.'" Multiple, evasive answers are adequate for you?
Given dubious and/or missing information in both instances above, a representative who claims to be independent of typical party posturing should be demanding facts and full, hard evidence. Why aren't you?

Texto completo: Report: Hank Azaria to quit voicing Apu on 'The Simpsons'
LOS ANGELES - Hank Azaria says he has no plans to continue voicing the character of Apu on "The Simpsons," according to an industry blog. But that isn't to say the Indian immigrant convenience store owner Azaria brought to life for 30 years won't live on.
Producers and Fox Broadcasting Co. wouldn't confirm to The Associated Press Azaria's exit or an end to Apu, a recurring character that has drawn criticism for reinforcing racial stereotypes.
The actor, who is white, indicated Friday to slashfilm.com that there was no resistance to phasing out his voice.
"We all made the decision together," Azaria said. "We all agreed on it. We all feel like it's the right thing and (feel) good about it."
Apu Nahasapeemapetilon runs the Kwik-E-Mart, a popular convenience store in the animated sitcom's Springfield. Apu is known for his catchphrase, "Thank you, come again." Azaria's first turn as Apu came in the first season's episode "The Telltale Head" in 1990.
Azaria speculated that one option going forward is to transition Apu's voice to an Indian actor.
In 2017, comedian Hari Kondabolu put out a documentary, "The Problem with Apu," that examined the character's cultural impact. Asked in the film's aftermath if he had watched the documentary, Azaria said:
"Thank you for asking me. Yes, of course, I did see it, and let me see if I can tell you how I feel about that. The idea that anybody, young or old, past or present, was bullied or teased or worse based on the character of Apu on 'The Simpsons,' the voice or any other tropes of the character is distressing," he said. "And especially in post-9/11 America, the idea that anybody was marginalized based on it or had a hard time was very upsetting to me personally and professionally."
Oprah details her decision to withdraw from Simmons film
NEW YORK - Oprah Winfrey said Friday that Russell Simmons attempted to pressure her about her involvement with a documentary in which several women detail sexual abuse allegations against the rap mogul, but his efforts were not what prompted her to leave the project.
"He did reach out multiple times and attempted to pressure me," Winfrey told The Associated Press through a spokesperson on Friday. It was not anything Simmons said that prompted Winfrey to withdraw from the "On the Record" film, according to Winfrey, but rather inconsistencies in the story of one of Simmons' accusers, Drew Dixon, that she felt needed to be addressed.
Winfrey said Friday that she still believes Dixon and other women in the film, but that more reporting was needed. "On the Record" directors Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have said they have ample evidence against Simmons, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings.
Winfrey has said she wanted to delay the release of the film, scheduled to premiere
Jan. 25 at the Sundance Film Festival, but that that view was not shared by the film's directors. "On the Record" had been part of her partnership with Apple, which no longer will distribute the documentary.
Winfrey, who herself has spoken openly of been sexually abused, announced she was leaving as executive producer on Jan. 10, saying that more work was needed and that and the filmmakers were "not aligned" in their "creative vision." The film's producers, Impact Partners, said in a statement earlier this week that the movie was "ready for Sundance.
"We have always championed the voices of those who have been wrongly silenced. The women in this film have made a great sacrifice by coming forward to tell their stories in their own words. We are honored to support them," the Impact statement reads. "We stand firmly behind the work of the intrepid filmmakers who continue to break new ground by advancing important stories in the public interest."
The AP does not typically name alleged victims of sexual abuse, but Dixon has told her story publicly, including on CBS This Morning earlier this week.
The communications between Winfrey and Simmons and her concerns about Dixon's story were first reported by The New York Times.
Simmons has denied any wrongdoing. On Friday, a Simmons representative issued a statement, saying "If defending himself against terrible accusations is considered intimidation then there would be no justice."
Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday, Winfrey disputed allegations by the makers of "On the Record" that she gave them little warning before her Jan. 10 announcement. In a story which ran early Friday, Dick and Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter that they received just 20 minutes notice before Winfrey issued her statement.
"It was very disappointing and upsetting," Ziering told The Hollywood Reporter. "We were concerned about the survivors and what the hell this is going to do to them. That was our first thought. 'Oh my God. Let's tell everybody and figure this out.'"
Winfrey told the AP that Dick and Ziering knew well of her intentions. She said she had raised concerns last month about the film needing more work. According to Winfrey, she told Dick and Ziering that "new information" had made her see gaps she "thought needed to be filled" and that it was better to "take a rest."
"They said they would go on with or without me," Winfrey told the AP. She said the bottom line for her was that "The film isn't ready."

Board chair to lead review at museum

Texto completo: Philadelphia Museum of Art board chair Leslie Anne Miller will take the reins of a "cultural assessment" of the museum's workplace in the wake of a New York Times report detailing claims by several women regarding the behavior of former Art Museum manager Joshua R. Helmer.
The museum is bringing in "an independent third party to understand what brought us here and most importantly what we need to change to be sure it never happens again," Miller said in an email to museum staff Friday evening. "This will entail soliciting feedback from you through individual interviews, focus groups or other methodologies."
To "ensure transparency and objectivity, I have agreed to lead this process," her note said.
In a separate email sent a few minutes later, museum director and CEO Timothy Rub said he was working with Miller "who is engaging our Board of Trustees in understanding and remedying the issues and concerns you are bringing forward. Nothing is more important to all of us than ensuring that the museum is a safe, welcoming, productive place, free from misconduct of any kind, where all voices are heard, and where there is no fear of coming forward to report any type of concern."
Miller's message said the process ahead includes "selecting the independent third party, developing the approach and protocol, reviewing existing policies and procedures, and ensuring tangible, actionable and transparent results and recommended next steps."
It was not clear whether this work is intended to address workplace issues broadly, or specifically investigate the allegations in the Times article plus any other claims of incidents that may have happened in the past at the museum - or both.
Asked Friday night to clarify, Miller said: "I can't comment on that."
An Art Museum spokesperson has failed during the last several days to respond to the question of whether an outside firm would investigate claims surrounding Helmer and any other claims anyone may have to bring forth from the past.
The New York Times' Jan. 10 article alleged that Helmer - who worked for several years as the Art Museum's assistant director for interpretation - engaged in relationships with subordinate Art Museum female staffers while dangling professional opportunities.
He has not responded to the allegations. Helmer declined to talk with the Times about his relationships, and put down the allegations against him as typical office politics. "You make enemies," he told the newspaper.
Helmer left the museum in 2018, and then took the top job at the Erie Art Museum - a post from which he was separated Monday, a few days after the Times story appeared, and a change.org petition had gathered about 3,000 signatures. An Erie museum spokesperson on Friday said she did not have current contact information for Helmer.
On Saturday, the Erie museum's board of directors released a statement announcing that board member Diana Denniston will oversee operations there as the museum seeks a new executive director. The statement said the museum is bringing in unspecified outside resources "to address any concerns" among staff members and that the board hopes to expand to at least 10 members "to add more voices." It has seven now, down from the 21 listed on its federal tax form filed in June 2018.
The Philadelphia Museum of Art has struggled to ease internal anger since the public airing of alleged bad behavior within its normally cloistered walls.
When staffers donned "We Believe Women" buttons in support of several women who had detailed their experiences with Helmer, the Art Museum initially told some staff to remove them, but, after protest, reversed the directive.
An online statement calling for "greater accountability" from the museum is now up to about 400 signatures from current and former Art Museum employees - as well as former interns. (The museum's 2018 annual report lists about 520 employees.)
On Wednesday, Mayor Jim Kenney, who holds an ex officio position on the Philadelphia Museum of Art board, called on the museum to revamp its personnel policy. Philadelphia's mayor occupies a board spot by virtue of the fact that the city owns the buildings in which the museum operates.
Rub has been meeting with employees in individual departments at the Art Museum in the last few days to hear concerns and questions, he wrote in his note. The email also said he had asked Miller to lead the process, which could begin as soon as next week.
"I expect that it will take some time and be a difficult experience," Rub's note said, "but it is absolutely necessary for us to do so. It will also need to yield tangible and actionable results. Your input and guidance will be invaluable throughout."

Texto completo: Last time John Lithgow appeared at the Academy of Music Anniversary concert, in 2007, he had a little competition for the spotlight.
"It was the 150th anniversary, a big gala with Prince Charles, Rod Stewart, and me, and I had lousy billing," says Lithgow jokingly.
On Saturday, Jan. 25, Lithgow returns, but this time as host and headliner for the annual white-tie concert and ball, which tips its black top hat to the Academy's 163rd year.
Lithgow - who acts, sings, writes, and has become perhaps the most winsome political observer among a largely acerbic pack - says he's enjoyed figuring out exactly what he'll be doing on stage alongside the Philadelphia Orchestra and merry music director Yannick Nzet-Sguin.
"It's been fantastic conceiving how much fun the Philadelphia Orchestra is capable of having along with being one of our greatest classical music institutions. They also told me Helen Mirren did it" - last year - "and, well, that is an easy act to follow."
Lithgow also has a peripheral connection to this orchestra that is not widely known.
"My first wife's father, my ex father-in-law, was the librarian for the Philadelphia Orchestra, Jesse Taynton. He was a bass player and then became librarian. When I was in my 20s I must have seen 10 concerts of the orchestra and we always went backstage to chat with Maestro Ormandy, who knew my ex-wife when she was a little girl. I even visited the orchestra in Saratoga."
The Academy he recalls as a wonderful hall. "I will never forget hearing the great Philadelphia Sound in the Academy of Music. It was really something."
Philadelphians can remind themselves of that sound the same weekend as the Academy gala when the orchestra returns to its old home for the first run of subscription concerts since moving into Verizon Hall in 2001. Pianist Yefim Bronfman joins the orchestra for three concerts featuring Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4.
Lithgow, 74, has enough range as an entertainer that no one will be surprised by whatever he ends up doing on the Academy stage. In The World According to Garp, he took a secondary character, tight-end-turned-transsexual woman Roberta Muldoon, and raised the role to that of sympathetic philosopher. This was in 1982, making the actor something of a social pioneer decades before the current era of wider gender-nuance literacy.
He starred, of course, in 3rd Rock From the Sun. He is Winston Churchill in The Crown. To children, he is the rollicking guide to big-band sounds and silly songs in his 1999 album Singin' in the Bathtub.
He is also author of the book Dumpty: The Age of Trump in Verse, published last year, and complained in a New York Times piece that "as bad a president as Mr. Trump has been, he's an even worse entertainer. He reads scripted lines like a panic-stricken schoolboy at a middle school assembly."
Lithgow calls the book a collection of "satirical doggerel." It begins with this:
Trumpty Dumpty wanted a wall
To stir up a rabid political brawl.
His Republican rivals, both feckless and stodgy,
Succumbed in the end to his rank demagogy.
Why does the actor dip into political commentary?
"Well, I don't know, it sort of caught up with me. I haven't pursued it. At a certain point you can't help respond, and because I am an entertainer I respond in an entertaining mode. There is nothing grave or somber about my political activism. It's more like, 'God, things are crazy.'"
His performance at the Academy promises something more harmonious. He's coy about what he'll be doing, but it will involve song, and he is threatening audience participation.
Lithgow says he's never learned to read music himself, but "taught myself how to play the guitar just to play silly songs for my kids when they were little."
At home, it's classical music that's on. "It's mainly baroque and classical," he says. "I love Handel and Haydn and Bach, and love chamber music. String quartets and Beethoven and the romantics. Mozart, of course."
It's actually because of his children's songs that Lithgow has now worked with about a dozen major orchestras.
"I would do one of those [concerts] with the Philadelphia Orchestra at the drop of a hat. I just love working with orchestras," he says. "I hang out with artists and work with musicians, like the best musicians in the country, and it's an amazing privilege and I don't do it often enough. I did the part of Voltaire/Pangloss in Candide working with some of the great singers, like Erin Morley. I was like, how did they let me in here? I am so lucky even to be asked."
And what is it like standing in front of a great orchestra?
"I compare it to running in front of a speeding locomotive. You trip and they just run right over you. It's terrifying. But I embrace terror."

Texto completo: An outfitter from Ely, Minn., a young cancer survivor and a bipartisan group of U.S. House members led by Rep. Betty McCollum, D-Minn., made eloquent arguments Wednesday in favor of a bill that would impose a federal ban on copper mining, an industry notorious for water pollution, in the watershed of the fragile Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCA).
But fodder for the most compelling argument on the bill's behalf came from a surprising source: Frank Ongaro, executive director of the industry group Mining Minnesota. Ongaro has long been an aggressive advocate for the Twin Metals Minnesota copper-nickel mine proposed not just in the BWCA's watershed but within a few miles of the wilderness itself.
In an exchange with an editorial writer this week, Ongaro's ire was focused less on the bill's potential threat to Twin Metals and far more on how it could deter other firms that want to mine in the BWCA watershed. There are "at least two" other companies that are "investing tens and tens of millions of dollars in proving up their resources" and "are very serious,'' he said, adding that one of them has a "large deposit" that straddles both the BWCA and Lake Superior watersheds.
It's certainly no surprise that mining companies covet the geologic riches embedded in northeastern Minnesota's ancient rocks, some of the richest deposits of precious metals in the world. But what Ongaro's comments make clear is that there are multiple firms seriously pursuing projects, with more likely to follow.
McCollum's bill isn't just about trying to stop or limit Twin Metals. Instead, the legislation is desperately needed to prevent the federal forest lands in the BWCA's watershed from becoming a mining industrial district.
Hard-rock copper mining has a sordid history. Its legacy includes acid runoff and heavy metal spills into nearby waterways. One of its waste storage systems can also produce something called "fugitive dust" -- containing potentially reactive materials like sulfur -- that can spread over nearby lakes, forests or communities.
Northern Minnesota has one of the world's most extreme climates, and the risk of a mistake, even with modern technology, that could permanently pollute the BWCA is simply too great to allow one mine, much less multiple mines, to operate near the wilderness. These among the reasons the Star Tribune Editorial Board made its case opposing the Twin Metals mine in a Nov. 24 editorial, "Not this mine. Not this location."
It's important to note that McCollum's bill would not affect PolyMet, another northeastern Minnesota copper-nickel mine situated outside the BWCA watershed. Instead, the bill would permanently ban sulfide-ore copper mining on about 234,000 acres of federal forest land that lie inside of it.
The mining industry's standard response to efforts like McCollum's frequently boils down to favoring letting the regulatory process play out and seeing if the project can meet environmental standards. This disingenuously ignores the accumulating evidence that the process isn't trustworthy at the state or federal level.
Last summer, the Star Tribune revealed that a Minnesota agency staffer worked to keep federal regulators' concerns about PolyMet out of the written record. On Monday, a state Court of Appeals rejected three permits PolyMet had obtained from the state, essentially rapping regulators for a lack of transparency. At the federal level, the Editorial Board has long criticized the Trump administration for aborting a study of copper mining's risks to the BWCA. The information gathered 20 months into a 24-month study still has not been released.
The New York Times also recently chronicled the Trump administration's efforts to weaken the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and other regulations safeguarding air and water quality. "These mining companies say they want to follow all the laws, but I certainly haven't heard them complaining about weakening NEPA or gutting the Clean Water Act," said Jason Zabokrtsky, who owns Ely Outfitting Company.
It is a shame that Minnesota's U.S. senators don't share the urgency of McCollum or business owners such as Zabokrtsky. At this point, McCollum's ban has no companion bill in the Senate. That's a big problem when home-state senators are expected to lead on bills like this. A spokeswoman for Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat, said she won't be introducing a companion bill or co-sponsoring one at this point.
Minnesota's senior senator, Democrat Amy Klobuchar, didn't respond to inquiries from an editorial writer. Her leadership on this politically dicey issue is vital. Her failure to respond reflects poorly on a presidential candidate who will face far tougher calls should she win the White House.

Texto completo: Video footage purporting to show the U.S. drone strike that killed Iran General Qassem Soleimani is actually from a video game, according to PolitiFact.com.
Shortly after the Jan. 3 hit on Soleimani, a YouTube video claiming to show the Soleimani "assassination" was viewed more than 2 million times on Facebook.
In the video, a group of vehicles are shot at as they reach the center of crosshairs on the screen. A voice says, "We’ve got guys running away from that vehicle. The vehicle is destroyed."
But no one was actually harmed in this video.
The footage is from the mobile video game "AC-130 Gunship Simulator," PolitiFact said. It was posted on YouTube in 2015, titled "AC-130 Gunship Simulator — Convoy engagement."
That video game has been used before to spread other false news, PolitiFact said. In 2017, photos that were supposedly published by the Russian Ministry of Defense showing collusion between the Islamic state and the U.S. were actually screenshots from the game.
Obama photo with Iran’s president is doctored Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar earlier this month said on Twitter, "The world is a better place without these guys in power," along with a photo of former President Barack Obama appearing to shake hands with Iran President Hassan Rouhani.
But Rouhani is still in power, the two world leaders have never met and the photo has been altered, according to The New York Times. The image of Obama was from a photo taken in 2011 when the president met with then-Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh.
The flag in the background of the doctored photo is also incorrect, the Times said. The photo is missing a line of white Arabic writing and a red tulip that appear on the Iranian flag. The orange bar on the flag of India in the original picture was changed to green to try to make it resemble the Iranian flag.
Gosar referred to reporters as "dimwitted," after other Twitter users pointed out the fake photo, the Times said.
"No one said this wasn’t Photoshopped," Gosar said on Twitter. "No one said the president of Iran was dead. No one said Obama met with Rouhani in person."
Gosar told Fox News he wasn’t intending to be authentic and he just wanted to criticize the two leaders.
False reports emerge in wake of wildfires The wildfires that killed at least 26 people and destroyed 2,000 homes in Australia have also been the subject of several false reports.
An image making the rounds on social media showing many fires ablaze in Australia is not a NASA photo but rather artist Anthony Hearsey’s 3-D depiction of the fires throughout a month, according to The Associated Press.
It shows current fires alongside others that already are out.
The photo wasn’t intended to be used out of context, Hearsey told the AP.
"It’s essentially a graphical interpretation of zoomed-out data from NASA. Nothing more or less," he said.
A story on the website InfoWars falsely reported that nearly 200 people have been arrested on charges of deliberately starting the wildfires, according to Snopes.com.
New South Wales police, since Nov. 8, have charged 183 people with bushfire-related offenses, Snopes said. But only 24 of those have been charged with deliberately starting fires.
Police said 53 people were arrested on charges of failure to comply with a fire ban and 47 people were charged with discarding a lighted match or cigarette on the ground.
Two people were charged after igniting fires to heat a cup of tea or cook food. Those fires were extinguished by firefighters, Snopes said.
And a social media post showed a collection of photos of animals that had supposedly perished in the Australian fires, including an image of a tiger, according to PolitiFact.com.
But the image, viewed more than 20 million times, is actually from a 2012 event in which confiscated taxidermy animals in Jakarta were being destroyed in a bonfire, PolitiFact said.
Possession of protected animals in Indonesia is a criminal offense.
Finland is not planning a 24-hour workweek Recent news reports claim Finland Prime Minister Sanna Marin is looking to cut the nation’s workweek to four, 6-hour days, according to The Washington Post.
But a spokesman told the Post that August Marin, who was minister of transport at the time, had floated the idea of either a four-day workweek or six-hour work days, not both.
Marin, 34, became prime minister in December.
There has been no recent activity to change the workweek, the spokesman said.
The story appears to have come from an article published by the Brussels newspaper New Europe, the Post said.
Zoi Didili, the reporter who wrote the story, told The Associated Press the translation from Finnish news sources had some details wrong.
"We fell into the trap of not cross-checking this information properly," Didili said. "We’ve been very alerted to the fact that so many news outlets reported the story without checking it from original sources."
The story has been corrected online, the Post said.

King’s legacy challenges rather than comforts us

Texto completo: Any church service we might attend that leaves us unchallenged in our actions, beliefs and assumptions is a waste of time. I offer you that as one person of faith to any other who might be reading this, as a piece of wisdom for the day that commemorates the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. So is any principle. What good are eyes to see only that which leaves us self-satisfied? What good are values that lead us nowhere but home?
King’s devotion to civil rights and his commitment to nonviolence are well-known, if less well-understood. From the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott to the sanitation workers’ strike in Memphis, Tennessee, King was committed to the value of solidarity, the necessity of peace and a vision of humanity more devoted to what unites us than what divides us. These are what of King’s life really remains some 50 years later, and they are what made him the subject of much vilification during his lifetime.
The question has been previously entertained — “How would we react to King now?” — but the answer seems ever more obvious: with the same vitriol and intentional misunderstanding that greeted him when he was alive. This is due chiefly to his refusal to make his values more convenient for anyone, be they fellow members of the civil rights movement or the president of the United States.
What, King might ask, is the difference between a white child in America, and a black child? Are they equally deserving of life? Of course they are. What about a child from a rich family, and a poorer one? Do they deserve the same in life? Yes, and King espoused the belief that the same persons were responsible for both of their well-beings.
What then is the difference in value between the life of an American child, black or white, and a Vietnamese one? King’s public determination of an answer — i.e., there’s no difference — led to his widespread alienation. In his speech at Manhattan’s Riverside Church, a speech known as “Beyond Vietnam,” King argued that not only was the war in Vietnam wrong, but that its prosecution was costing huge sums of money that might better be spent funding social programs than dropping napalm on Vietnamese children. As follows: “A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, ‘This is not just.’ ”
King went on to argue that, as an extension of advocacy for their own rights, those in the civil rights movement ought to extend themselves to opposing war in Vietnam — fighting for the rights of “little brown Vietnamese children” as much as for their own.
In reaction, a New York Times editorial argued that “linking these hard, complex problems will not lead to solutions, but to deeper confusion.” Others argued that King raised doubts about “the Negroes’ loyalty,” as though the loyalty of a people who built this country — with and against their will — is best evaluated by their willingness to travel across the world and kill other people of color.
But, of course, these issues were, and are, linked! The contention that the poor in Vietnam and in America have no moral connection to one another is to make excuses for a lack of moral accountability. The notion that the human and civil rights of a black child in America should be different from those of a child in Vietnam — that violating those rights is any less wrong — is plainly bankrupt. It is an intentional othering in the favor of those whose continued political and financial ascendance rely on war.
What, then, is the value of an Iranian child? One from Iraq or Syria? What about one at our own southern border?
King simply was making his case that violence was wrong to those with more power than an individual Klansman or deep South city mayor. He simply extended his belief that the poor and the vulnerable deserve better than guns, force and oppression, regardless of where they are, regardless of whether that oppression comes from their government or our own.
To honor the legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., and the values for which he suffered threats, violence, alienation and death, we need to link the hard issues. Now is the time to be courageously unpopular in our opposition to war, to injustice, to poverty. Now is the time to see our own children in other children, and our own person in the body of another. Consistency and clarity in these things might have you vilified, but that is nothing so much as evidence of the need for us to be consistent and clear.
This is as much a challenge to me as it is to you. It will come no more easily to me than to you, but our blessed discomfort might just make us free.

New York Times endorses Warren and Klobuchar in Democratic primary

Texto completo: The New York Times editorial board revealed two preferred choices for Democratic presidential candidates with just more than two weeks left until the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota got the Grey Lady's endorsement, revealed Sunday on an episode of The Weekly.
"Amy Klobuchar has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic center. Her vision goes beyond the incremental. Given the polarization in Washington and beyond, the best chance to enact many progressive plans could be under a Klobuchar administration,” the board wrote.
The two candidates take different approaches to their candidacies, with Klobuchar, 59, offering a pragmatic approach and Warren, 70, pitching a left-wing vision of dramatic structural change.
"Three years into the Trump administration, we see little advantage to exchanging one over-promising, divisive figure in Washington for another. Good news, then, that Elizabeth Warren has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic left," the board said.
“May the best woman win," the editorial board said.

The editorial board had narrowed down its choices to four candidates: Warren and Klobuchar, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who dropped out of the race after his interview with the editorial board.
In his interview with the editorial board, former Vice President Joe Biden, 77, pushed back against concerns that he is too old to be president and defended his foreign policy record, noting that he had disagreements with President Barack Obama on Afghanistan policy. Members of the editorial board expressed concern that he was not inspiring enough, among other concerns.
It is unclear how much endorsements from newspapers and prominent public figures helps a candidate. The New York Times has a hit-or-miss record with endorsing candidates.
In 2016, it endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, calling her "one of the most broadly and deeply qualified presidential candidates in modern history." Ohio Gov. John Kasich got its endorsement for the Republican nomination, calling eventual nominee Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz "equally objectionable for different reasons."
It also endorsed Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary race rather than Obama after early state nominating contests had started, and Obama had won Iowa and Clinton finished first in New Hampshire.
"The next president needs to start immediately on challenges that will require concrete solutions, resolve, and the ability to make government work. Mrs. Clinton is more qualified, right now, to be president," it said.
In 2004, the paper endorsed eventual nominee John Kerry, also after the then-Massachusetts senator and future secretary of state had won state contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, and elsewhere.
In general election races, the New York Times has endorsed the Democratic nominee in every election since 1960.
The Des Moines Register, a newspaper prominent in Iowa politics, has not yet revealed its primary endorsement. The Quad-City Times, a regional paper in Eastern Iowa, endorsed Klobuchar on Saturday.

Two deceptions at the heart of Democrats' impeachment brief

Texto completo: In a newly released impeachment brief, Democratic House managers argue that President Trump must be removed "immediately" to protect the integrity of the current presidential race. "The Senate must use that remedy now to safeguard the 2020 U.S. election," the managers write.
"The Senate should immediately remove President Trump from office to prevent further abuses," they continue. "He is an immediate threat to the nation and the rule of law. It is imperative that the Senate convict and remove him from office now."
Democrats insist on Trump's immediate removal because, they argue, he was the knowing beneficiary of Russian help in the 2016 election, and if he is not thrown out of office right now, he will do it again. But in making their argument, Democrats make two critical mischaracterizations about Trump, Republicans, and 2016. One is flat-out wrong, while the other is misleading.
The one that is flat wrong is the Democrats' assertion that Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate "a debunked conspiracy theory that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 presidential election to aid President Trump, but instead that Ukraine interfered in that election to aid President Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton."
The problem is, the theory does not hold that Russia "did not interfere" in the 2016 election. There is a mountain of evidence that Russia interfered, and that has been the conclusion of every investigation into the matter, beginning with the first congressional probe, by the House Intelligence Committee under then-chairman Devin Nunes. The theory is that in addition to Russian interference, some people in Ukraine, including some government officials, also tried to influence the U.S. election. It was not a government-run effort, and it was on a far smaller scale than the Russian project, but it happened.
Trump and his supporters have long pointed to the example of Ukraine's interior minister, former prime minister, and ambassador to the U.S. taking to social media to condemn Trump during the campaign. They also point to a Ukrainian Parliament member's attacks on Paul Manafort and efforts to publicize a "black ledger" that contained an unverified allegation about Manafort being paid in cash for work in Ukraine. They also point to connections between anti-Trump figures in Ukraine and Fusion GPS, the American opposition research firm behind the sensational and false Steele dossier. Finally, they point to the mysterious actions of a Democratic National Committee employee who kept in touch with anti-Trump elements in Ukraine.
None of that is definitive, but it is also not debunked. And it is not a denial of Russian interference but a recognition that in addition to that interference, some in Ukraine also tried to influence the election.
Nevertheless, in the brief, Democrats make repeated reference to their own supposition — that Trump and Republicans embraced "the theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, interfered in the 2016 election." They even suggest that Trump and Republicans, in embracing a theory that they did not, in fact, embrace, were parroting Russian propaganda.
The other mischaracterization in the Democratic brief is the assertion that, in 2016, Trump "welcomed Russia's election interference." The brief quotes special counsel Robert Mueller's report that the Trump campaign welcomed Russian help because it "expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts."
That's not wrong — Trump did, in fact, welcome Russia-based leaks — but grossly out of context. The context is this: Trump welcomed Russia-based leaks about the Clinton campaign because the media were enthusiastically embracing and repeating Russian-based leaks about the Clinton campaign. Print, internet, TV, everyone, was accepting, repeating, and amplifying the material released by WikiLeaks from the Russian hack of top Clinton campaign official John Podesta.
Perhaps people have forgotten how prominently media organizations featured the Russia-based material. If they have, here are a dozen examples of headlines, just from the New York Times and just from the few weeks immediately before the 2016 election:
"CNN Cuts Ties to Analyst as Emails Show She Tipped Off Clinton Allies" (11/1/16)
"Leaks Lay Bare a Longtime Clinton Adviser's Unflinching Straight Talk" (10/29/16)
"Chelsea Clinton's Frustrations and Devotion Shown in Hacked Emails" (10/28/16)
"Donations to Foundation Vexed Hillary Clinton's Aides, Emails Show" (10/26/16)
"'We Need to Clean This Up,' Clinton Aide Frets in Newly Public Email" (10/26/16)
"A Constellation of Influencers; Behind the Curtain at Teneo" (10/23/16)
"Email Outlines Clinton's Potential No. 2s" (10/18/16)
"Genial Clinton Emerges in Hacked Transcripts of Goldman Sachs Talks" (10/15/16)
"Leaked Emails About Clinton Hearten Rival" (10/12/16)
"Emails Disclose Clinton's Strain to Hone Message" (10/11/16)
"Clinton Aides Were Wary of de Blasio, Emails Show" (10/10/16)
"Leaked Speech Excerpts Show Clinton at East With Wall Street and Free Trade" (10/7/16)
(The headlines are from the paper's print edition, as preserved in the Nexis database; slightly different headlines might exist in web editions.)
The Times editorial board even argued that the WikiLeaks disclosures showed Clinton should have been more open with the public in the months before the election. "Fuller disclosure would clearly have helped her when it came to her lucrative speeches to Wall Street," the paper wrote in an editorial headlined, "A WikiLeaks Lesson for Mrs. Clinton." "Imagine if months ago, Mrs. Clinton had done her own giant information release."
Of course, the Times was not the only media organization to trumpet the Russia-based leaks. They all trumpeted the Russia-based leaks. Everyone was complicit. And that is what makes the Democratic charge against Trump so misleading. He wasn't welcoming something that everyone else was condemning. He was welcoming something that everyone else was welcoming, too. And now, in retrospect, that is a terrible offense, part of the foundation for removing the president from office?
Neither mischaracterization in the Democratic brief is a mistake; Democratic prosecutors know full well what actually happened. But the mischaracterizations are necessary to build the case against the president, to show that he had corrupt motives in the Ukraine matter. They are, of course, not the entire case, but they are important. And they are wrong.

Don't let the liberal media erase women who regret their abortions

Texto completo: The liberal media sure wants you to believe that women never regret their abortions. Just look at some of these recent headlines.
A Salon article was published titled “Debunking the 'abortion regret' narrative: Data shows women feel relief, not regret.” The Washington Post's headline mused, “Five years after an abortion, most women say they made the right decision.” CNN went with “The majority of women feel relief, not regret, after an abortion, study says.” Meanwhile, VICE published a piece titled “Most women don’t regret abortions. Why would they?”
This reporting stems from the “Turnaway Study,” conducted by pro-abortion researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and other pro-abortion institutions, and funded by pro-abortion foundations. The results of the study’s survey of 667 women — a small sample size that amounts to less than a third of the number of women who have abortions every day in the United States — is that abortion regret essentially does not exist.
This will be news to the thousands of women who have registered their regret and testified publicly with the Silent No More Awareness Campaign, as well as and the hundreds of thousands of women who have sought healing after abortion at Rachel’s Vineyard. According to the liberal media, these women must live in an alternative universe, one where there are actual emotional consequences to aborting one’s own child.
Of course, this latest bit of pro-abortion propaganda conveniently comes out just before the 47th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, and as hundreds of thousands of Americans are making travel plans to the March for Life in D.C., San Francisco, and all over the country. The liberal media's misleading coverage of this study, which stops just short of recommending abortion, cannot reverse the powerful pro-life trends at work in our nation.
The abortion rate is lower than it has been since Roe v. Wade, record numbers of abortion businesses have closed, and states have passed hundreds of laws designed to protect the unborn. And the most hopeful sign that the tide is turning is that the abortion rate is falling even in states with few restrictions. The fact is, mothers are choosing life because it, not abortion, is the truly empowering choice. The theme of this year’s March for Life is “Life Empowers – Pro-life is Pro-woman.”
It is not pro-woman to tell an unexpectedly pregnant mother that she is not up to the challenge of motherhood. No one is saying teenage motherhood is ideal (those numbers are down, too), but choosing abortion is a dead end. Meanwhile, choosing life allows for countless possibilities.
There’s also nothing empowering about the act of abortion itself.
Abortion is not an act of power, but despair. And the abortion industry is not a beacon of freedom, it is a money-making industry, and nothing more. Abortion is not “healthcare,” because pregnancy is not a disease. Women are manipulated and abused by abortion providers, and their babies are thrown away as medical waste.
The women of Silent No More who will share their heart-breaking testimonies at the March for Life in D.C. and the Walk for Life in San Francisco this coming week will tell their stories of being held down on cold tables as their children were violently ripped from their wombs. Afterward, they were guided to (often filthy) recliners with all the other women who had just endured the same nightmare. They will tell you about the weeping and the anguish, and sometimes, the excruciating pain.
And yes, they will tell you about the regret, sometimes repressed for years, but ultimately responsible for life-altering consequences such as failed relationships, drug and alcohol addictions, more abortions and, sometimes, thoughts of suicide. Additionally, sometimes women are the victims of botched abortions and will never be able to have children afterwards.
In 2013, the New York Times tucked an interesting fact toward the end of a long story on abortion: Just 5% of women who were denied abortion and had their babies wish they hadn’t. The other 95%, in the words of the researcher quoted, “adjust.”
Every life is full of adjustments: Illnesses we haven’t planned, deaths of loved ones that we would never have chosen, lost jobs, divorce. The list of unexpected events is endless, and yet we find a way to go on. Adjusting to the reality of a brand new unplanned life, while admittedly difficult in many circumstances, is the most empowering adjustment we can make.

Iran to keep black box from downed Ukrainian passenger jet as victims' bodies are returned home

Texto completo: Iran indicated that it would keep and analyze the black boxes from Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, which Tehran has admitted to shooting down, as the bodies of the 11 Ukrainian victims were returned to their homeland.
Iran backtracked after its lead investigator in the crash, Hassan Rezaeifar, said that the plane’s black boxes would be transferred to Ukraine because he did not have the capability to analyze the data held within the devices, according to the New York Times. Rezaeifar reversed himself on Sunday, saying that his team would attempt to extract the data.
"We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran; otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country," Rezaeifar said.
Iran admitted to shooting down the passenger jet and killing everyone onboard three days after the aircraft crashed almost immediately after taking off from an airport in Tehran. The Iranian regime had first tried to blame the crash on the pilot, saying that the plane appeared to be flying erratically before its crash.
Tehran’s excuse began to unravel when video surfaced showing a missile hitting the plane and setting it on fire shortly before it crashed. The confession sparked mass protests in Iran against the government as protesters accused the regime of avoiding responsibility and lying to cover up its mistakes and crimes.
Iran said it unintentionally struck the plane while it was firing ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases where American soldiers were stationed. No Iraqi nor U.S. servicemen died in the attack, though 11 American soldiers were treated for concussions afterward.
Also on Sunday, the bodies of the Ukrainian victims returned home, where President Volodymyr Zelensky stood silently on a tarmac in Kyiv to meet them.
Iran’s attack on the military bases came as retaliation for a Jan. 2 U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general and terror mastermind Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was declared a terrorist by the U.S. government and controlled Tehran’s terror network throughout the Middle East. He planned and executed attacks that killed hundreds of U.S. soldiers.

Maureen Dowd: Trump’s choice of defenders another way to lose the women’s vote

Texto completo: Washington • Can a woman be president of the United States?
Hell, yes.
I’ve covered the men who run the world my whole life. And there have been a lot of screw-ups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off a cliff. There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a pervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution.
So please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and just show how you could wield power like a boss. Ibid: Nancy Pelosi.
When Steve Bannon called Pelosi a “total assassin,” according to the hot new book “A Very Stable Genius,” by Washington Post writers Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, he meant it as the highest compliment. You won’t find Pelosi keening about gender; she’s too busy taking care of business.
Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman. She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism. She lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and because she didn’t emulate her husband’s ethos of campaign till the last dog dies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters. She lost because she and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didn’t listen to Bill Clinton, the world’s leading expert on the white, male, rural vote, when he warned them that there was trouble and offered to help out.
Trump operates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal scream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the country. Women are now a majority of the workforce and whites are heading toward a minority status. Hollywood cannot cling to its benighted — and self-defeating — desire to stay a white male club forever, despite the fact that women have always made up half the audience.
Trump’s ascent does not make it harder for women to ascend — just the opposite. Look at the throng of women who were outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018.
Once a woman electrifies Democrats the way JFK, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama did — and the way Trump does his base — she will win.
Trump is once more doing his part to energize women voters. On Friday, we learned that the president will get help from Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate.
The Starr chamber was a shameful period of U.S. history, with the prissy Puritan independent counsel hounding and virtually jailing Monica Lewinsky and producing hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad erotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains and genitalia. Like the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale and other Pharisaic Holy Rollers before him, the prosecutor who read the Bible and sang hymns when he jogged became fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way.
Even Trump was appalled. “Starr’s a freak,” the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. “I bet he’s got something in his closet.” In other interviews, he called Starr “a lunatic,” “a disaster” and “off his rocker,” and expressed sympathy for Hillary having to stand by her man when he was “being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko.”
Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clinton’s sexual high jinks, is now going to bat for President “Access Hollywood.” After playing an avenging Javert about foreplay in the Oval, Starr will now do his utmost to prove that a real abuse of power undermining Congress and American foreign policy is piffle.
In 2007, he defended Jeffrey Epstein. By 2016, Starr was being ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women and looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes convicted of sexual assaults. In other words, he’s a complete partisan hack who doesn’t give a damn about sexual assault.
And then there’s Dershowitz, whose past clients have included such sterling fellows as Epstein, Claus von Bülow, O.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein. How did he miss Ted Bundy? Still, Dershowitz has put himself on the side of an impressive pantheon of villainy in the realm of violence against girls and women.
Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew’s accuser, has also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex — a contention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit.
On Fox News, Dershowitz has made the case that it is Pelosi who put herself above the law by delaying the delivery of the articles of impeachment. Good luck with that one.
The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, a few days ago deemed that Trump’s slimy Ukraine gambit violated a law. Yet Dershowitz will somehow argue that it doesn’t represent high crimes and misdemeanors.
He tweeted that he’s nonpartisan because he opposed Bill’s impeachment and voted for Hillary, even as he joined up with Bill’s persecutor. Dershowitz said that he is participating “to defend the integrity of the Constitution.”
That assertion may fly in Foxworld. But in the real world, it’s ridiculous. You can bet that Trump and his buddies will continue to turn out the women’s vote.

Texto completo: The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump began Thursday when John Roberts, chief justice of the Supreme Court, directed all of the senators to stand and raise their right hands. Ever since, I can’t get two questions out of my head.
The first: How in God’s name — and it was in God’s name — can the Republicans who have already decided to acquit Trump take a solemn oath to administer “impartial justice”? They’re partial to the core, unabashedly so, as their united march toward a foregone conclusion shows. A mind meld this ironclad isn’t a reflection of facts. It’s a triumph of factionalism.
The majority of the party’s senators have said outright or clearly signaled that they have no intention of finding the president guilty and removing him from office. Yapping lap dogs like Lindsey Graham and obedient manservants like Mitch McConnell have gone further, mocking the whole impeachment process.
So the oath they took: How does that work? Did they cross the fingers on their left hands? Do they reason that U.S. politics has reached a nadir of such fundamental hypocrisy and overweening partisanship that no one regards that pledge as anything but window dressing?
Certainly they’re telling themselves that their own political survival, hinging on obsequiousness to a president with a talent for retribution, matters more than honor. Over the three years of the Trump presidency, they’ve become expert at that calculation.
My second question is really a subset, corollary or anagram of the first: How can Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Martha McSally stand to look at themselves in the mirror? I’m singling out these three somewhat randomly but also because they’ve traveled particularly self-mortifying journeys away from self-respect.
At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Chuck Schumer, leader of the Senate’s Democratic minority, said that when the chief justice walked into the chamber earlier that day, “I saw members on both sides of the aisle visibly gulp.” Schumer attributed that to the palpable “weight of history.” But for many of them, it probably had more to do with their awareness that they were about to sell out again, this time in circumstances that would be remembered long into the future.
Democrats, too, have made up their minds, and that would be equally upsetting but for the mountain of actual evidence on which their judgment rests. You can erase all the testimony in the House by Gordon Sondland, David Holmes, Alexander Vindman, Fiona Hill and others. You can delete Mick Mulvaney’s admission at a White House news conference of a quid pro quo. You can discount Lev Parnas’ ongoing aria of atonement. Still, you have the transcript (of sorts) of Trump’s “perfect” phone call with the president of Ukraine, in which it’s clear to any sane reader with a semblance of common sense that he’s trying to trade U.S. aid for the smearing of Joe Biden.
If there were nothing to this, why would Trump stonewall Congress to the extent that he has? That’s not how the innocent act.
When witness after witness tells a version of the same story, providing pieces of a puzzle that fit snugly together, you can reach a conclusion about the whole of it. That’s called logic.
And if the actual case against Trump were weak, why would Republicans keep redirecting attention to Democrats’ motivations — to how much they despise the president? That’s called distraction.
McSally practiced it Thursday when, in a moment of breathtaking hostility, she answered a reasonable question from Manu Raju of CNN about whether any new evidence should be presented during the Senate trial by snarling, “Liberal hack!”
She’s terrified. Her state, Arizona, is increasingly purple. She lost her 2018 race for the Senate and ended up in the chamber only by appointment following John McCain’s death. She has to run again this year, against Mark Kelly, the former astronaut, who’s a popular figure. She’s vulnerable, and standing with Trump is almost as much of a gamble as standing up to him would be.
But she once did stand up to him. She used to have guts. Before going into politics, she blazed trails as an Air Force pilot and even sued the secretary of defense when she detected discrimination against women. During her successful campaign for the House in 2016, she pointedly didn’t endorse Trump and just as pointedly spoke out against the behavior that he copped to — no, bragged about — in that infamous “Access Hollywood” tape. McSally had a moral compass then.
Now she just has a hunger to hold onto her suite of offices in the Capitol. She has wagered that emulating Trump is her best bet. At the conclusion of this pathetic excuse for a trial, she’ll vote to acquit him — impartially, of course.
She’ll be joined by Cruz and Rubio, who are special targets of my disappointment because they were once special targets of Trump’s ugliness. They know it firsthand and well.
They campaigned against him for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, when he didn’t just criticize them but viciously belittled and even savaged them. He conspiracy-theorized a role for Cruz’s father in John F. Kennedy’s assassination.
“A pathological liar,” Cruz called Trump.
But now that Trump is president and his base has become the most impassioned constituency in the party, Cruz is his biggest cheerleader and a ready mouthpiece for all of those lies. He has swapped thoughts of 2016 for thoughts of 2024, when there’s another opportunity to reach for the White House and Trump’s loyalists will come in handy. He’ll have to muscle aside Javanka and Don Jr., but that’s a pickle for another day. First step: acquittal!
Rubio has long fashioned himself a foreign-policy maven and took a hard line when it came to Russia. So you might think that the Trump presidency would be especially galling to him. You might also think that Trump’s bullying of Ukraine — which left the country more vulnerable to Russian aggression — would be some sort of breaking point.
But he’s a Republican member of Congress in 2020, which means he’s a sycophantic shell of his former self. And having bitten his tongue about Trump’s global misadventures, he’ll now abet more of the same by helping Trump stay in office.
There are so many other Republican senators to marvel at. Mitt Romney, what was the point of diving back into public life if you’re going to prop up a president whose fraudulence you once gave a whole long speech about? Lamar Alexander, you venerated Howard Baker, a fellow Tennessean who once held your Senate seat and put principle above partisanship by standing up to President Richard Nixon. Why not do the same and stand up to Trump?
Susan Collins, I can’t imagine the exhaustion of your role as political wild card, scrutinized to a fare-thee-well. But come on. If you’re going to pride yourself on autonomy, you need to exercise it when it matters most.
It’s not fun to be any of you right now, with McConnell above you and #MAGA hellions below you poised to make your life a misery if you stray. But no one forced you into public service. When you entered the Senate, you took an oath, and you took another one Thursday. I have a third question, maybe just a rewording of the first and second: Doesn’t that nag at you even a little?

Bret Stephens: Can anyone save the Republicans from Trumpism?

Texto completo: Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and current long-shot — make that, loooooooong-shot — candidate for the Republican Party’s presidential nomination, is a keen student of New Hampshire politics. In an interview with me this week, he noted the following fact: Every time an incumbent president of either party faced a significant primary challenge in the Granite State, he failed in his bid for reelection.
It happened to George H.W. Bush in 1992 after Patrick Buchanan took 38% of the New Hampshire vote.
It happened to Jimmy Carter in 1980 after Teddy Kennedy took 39%.
It happened to Gerald Ford in 1976 after Ronald Reagan took 48%.
It happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1968 after Eugene McCarthy took 42%.
It happened to Harry Truman in 1952 when Estes Kefauver beat him outright, 55% to 44%.
So, Weld reasons, why not try to make it happen to Donald Trump, too?
That’s the hopeful thought in what otherwise seems to be Weld’s hopeless bid to derail a president whose support among Republicans was 89% last month, according to Gallup. Weld is too much a politician to admit publicly that he sees no shot for himself of winning — a Messiah complex lies at the root of many monumental ambitions.
But he’s also wise enough to know that losing well can achieve great things, like bringing down a president who, he said, “regards the law as something to be evaded.” Can that be done between now and Feb. 11, the date of the New Hampshire primary? Weld rests his hopes on two things: New England Republicanism, which remains alive and well despite reports of its demise; and Trump’s trial in the Senate, whose result may not yet be a forgone conclusion.
On the former, note that Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire all have Republican governors, who, like Weld, are relative moderates compared to the rest of the party. New England Republicans can also be fickle in their loyalties, and late to make up their minds: Buchanan was also seen as a nonstarter against Bush Sr. just weeks before the 1992 primary.
On the latter, Weld knows a lot about the impeachment process, having worked on the House Judiciary Committee’s staff as a young lawyer in 1974 as it considered articles against Richard Nixon. Nixon, Weld recalled, “was essentially forced to withdraw from the presidency because he had been caught lying on television to the American people on one topic” — a foothill of a deception compared to Trump’s Karakoram range.
Weld also knows how quickly things can turn in the course of a trial. “Cases don’t look the same at the end as they do at the beginning,” he noted, recalling his prosecutions of public corruption in the 1980s as U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts, where he won 109 convictions in 111 corruption cases. He believes that if four Republican senators join Democrats in voting to call witnesses — Ohio’s Rob Portman could provide the decisive vote — then anything is possible.
“The one sport where the unthinkable can become the inevitable in a matter of weeks or even days,” Weld said, “is national politics, not the National Football League.”
Maybe that’s right, assuming devastating testimony from John Bolton, the former national security adviser; former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas; and who knows who (or what) else. Not that any kind of testimony is likely to sway the 67 senators needed for a conviction. But it’s not quite out of the question that it might, in the coming weeks, sway a large fraction of New Hampshire Republicans to vote against the president, thereby setting into motion forces that could bring him down.
That’s the hope, at any rate. The odds against? I’d say 20-to-1 — which is to say, still worth a shot. If it fails, Weld said he would not run as an independent. Unlike in 2016, when he ran with Gary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket (and won 4.5 million votes) he has no interest in playing the spoiler to anyone in the race except Trump.
The larger question if it fails is what becomes of the GOP. Weld compared the party to the late-stage Whigs of the early 1850s, which were riven between the nativist Know Nothing faction and the antislavery wing that would become the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln. Fortunately, the good side won that time.
And this time? The best conservative case for rooting for a Democrat to win this fall — any Democrat, including Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren — is that it might be the only way to save the Republican Party from itself. That could happen if a critical mass of conservatives repudiates Trumpism or forms a new party on the Lincoln model. Weld calls it the Liberty Party.
Alternatively a Sanders or Warren victory could send the GOP to even further extremes. In politics, as in nature, forces always come in pairs. Democrats who want to see Republicans recover their center need to protect their own. In the meantime, wish Bill Weld well in his Granite State carom shot.

Marco Rubio: Investing in China is not a good deal for America

Texto completo: It’s no secret that Wall Street hated President Trump’s aggressive trade tactics toward China. But its executives are very happy with the financial services section of the recently signed “phase one” deal that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin negotiated with China.
Instead of holding China accountable for exploiting American capital markets, “phase one” of the deal will make sure American capital continues to directly fund China’s state-run economy. American financing will increase to state-owned enterprises like China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, which produces about 80 percent of the Chinese Navy’s main equipment, and Hikvision, whose products Beijing uses to surveil Uighurs in Xinjiang.
Another appalling example of how good this part of the deal is for China is the provision authorizing American financial companies to purchase Chinese nonperforming loans. These are loans that the borrower is struggling to pay off. This makes them a favorite of Chinese state-owned enterprises and other companies with large capital expenditures but little revenue growth expected in the near term.
A majority of Chinese nonperforming loans go to state-owned enterprises. In the past, when a Chinese bank struggled with financing nonperforming loans on its books, Beijing had to bail it out with Chinese money. But now, under this deal, American savings can do it.
The rising number of nonperforming loans has been a problem in China’s economy; last year ended with almost the highest percentage of loans outstanding in over a decade. President Trump’s tariffs were having a real effect on the Chinese economy. It brought its leaders to the table to deal with vital issues like China’s theft of American intellectual property and its blocking of market access for American manufacturers. But now this part of the “deal” with China throws open the gates to American capital. They now get to keep up their exploitation, with our money.
For decades, China has used Wall Street’s hunger for profit to lure American capital into a trap: the Communist Party’s clear intent of displacing the United States as the world’s economic and military superpower. This “deal” will result in American capital flowing to the government-owned companies that China props up to undermine our country. This is not a win.
Investing American capital in China may earn better returns in the short term. But it will come at a tremendous cost in the long term.
American dollars aren’t being invested in Chinese companies that succeed based on their honest business model and ability to grow. They are being invested in companies that exist to serve a Chinese Communist Party intent on undermining America, human rights and religious liberty.
Allowing the savings of Americans to be linked to the success of the Chinese government and Communist Party is a grave error we will come to regret. Beijing’s state planners couldn’t have written the financial services section better if they tried. They’ll get to finance their industrial ambitions with the deepest, most liquid capital markets in the world — our own.
Policymakers in Washington, who were once naïve about China’s exploitation of our capital markets and the American-led global order, are now giving the financial relationship between the United States and Beijing the scrutiny it rightly deserves. For instance, the bipartisan Equitable Act, which I introduced, would delist Chinese companies that do not comply with American laws and regulations for financial transparency and accountability from United States exchanges.
Finding a peaceful and workable path forward for United States-China relations is the defining geopolitical issue of this century, and President Trump deserves credit for getting the Chinese to the negotiating table. However, the financial services section of the “phase one” deal could undermine the significant progress the agreement makes on other priorities.
As the Trump administration negotiates “phase two,” we must grapple with this challenge by enacting a pro-American industrial and financial policy that puts American capital to work for American workers, their skills and our development.

Utah Jazz’s Joe Ingles lends support to firefighting efforts back home in Australia

Texto completo: Joe Ingles feels like he’s a long way away from his homeland of Australia, which is currently experiencing fires that have burned an area the size of West Virginia since September. It’s estimated that about a billion animals have died, 3,000 homes have been destroyed and the economic cost could be $3.5 billion, according to the New York Times.
So Ingles is doing something to help. He’ll contribute $500 for every made 3-point shot made from the beginning of the season until the All-Star break to “firefighters and supporting organizations,” according to a press release. He’s made 93 threes so far this season, so he’ll be adding to a base of $46,500.
“I’m in a position to be able to do something and do some more on top of what we’ve done with the NBA already,” Ingles said. Ingles, along with eight other Australian NBA players, donated $750,000 to benefit the Red Cross last week.
He also hopes to get Jazz fans involved. He’s asking fans to also donate $1 and up for every 3-pointer, which they can do on the utahjazz.com website.
“I’m hoping that some people with some spare cash that want to throw a couple extra dollars," Ingles said.
The Jazz are also selling a “Support Australia” T-shirt as the team’s Item of the Game for the Jazz’s game vs. Houston on Jan. 27. Proceeds from that will also go to benefit the firefighters.
Luke Walton on Jordan Clarkson
Current Sacramento coach Luke Walton coached Jordan Clarkson during two of his formative years in Los Angeles, so he knows the Jazz’s bench scorer well. Before Saturday’s game, he was asked to give his impressions on the 27-year-old.
“I had a really good time coaching Jordan. [He’s a] great teammate, instant offense,” Walton said. "He’s one of those guys who he always feels hot, but if he sees a couple go through the net, you better adjust your defense to take that away from him because he can get it going really quick.”
Sacramento - Portland trade
According to multiple league reports, the Kings made a trade right before Saturday’s game, sending Trevor Ariza, Wenyen Gabriel and Caleb Swanigan to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Kent Bazemore, Anthony Tolliver and two second round picks.
The primary reason for the Trail Blazers to make the deal was to cut $12.5 million in salary, which substantially cuts their salary tax bill. Meanwhile, the Kings gain two second round picks and the respected Bazemore, who they could keep or forward along in the trade market.
The deal meant both Sacramento and Portland were shorthanded for their respective games on Saturday. The Blazers had just eight players available for their game, while the Kings had 11.

Texto completo: The snow had gathered on the yard and my boys had rushed out the door. I looked from the window as they rolled a small snowball into the base of a traditional snowman. Watching their fun reminded me of a fiasco I experienced a few winters ago. It could have happened to anyone, really, so please consider this a public service announcement.
It was after a huge snowstorm and my two sons had built snowmen in the backyard. This was around the time that “Making a Murderer” was a huge show. I had just bought a new documentary camera, so I thought it would be hilarious to chop the snowmen’s heads off, spread splashes of red food coloring around, and then make my own short documentary about a family of snow-people who were brutally murdered. Some people do family home evening. This is how we roll, and we went all out.
We interviewed fake detectives who were investigating the “heinous crime,” fake witnesses who’d heard the non-existent screams, and showed a fake lineup where it was just snowmen silhouettes.
I edited it all together and titled the faux-documentary “It’s Snow Making a Murderer.” I was very proud of it and invited all of my friends over, locked the doors behind them and made them watch it. If they complimented it, I would give them a chance to escape. Most complimented it eventually.
A couple days later, I heard a knock on my door. It was a police officer. Apparently there was an elderly gentleman missing from a nearby rest home. He showed me a picture and I told him I hadn’t seen the man.
That was when I saw out of the corner of my eye, through a window, another officer walking in my backyard.
The cop at the door said, “Don’t worry, my partner is just checking all the yards for signs of the man.”
I shrugged, totally forgetting about what the cop would find. The officer at the door was in the middle of saying goodbye when his partner came around the corner and said, “We have a few more questions.”
By this time, neighbors were looking out windows to watch. The officer took me to the backyard. The sun had mostly melted the snowmen into unrecognizable lumps, but it had not melted the snow enough to get rid of the splashes of blood spread across the yard in a very murdery way. Blood really pops against snow. Plus, there were still two bloody knives lying on the ground.
“I can explain,” I said, freaking out just a little. I told them about the completely innocent mockumentary I’d filmed about the brutal murder of a fictional snow family (I know, as opposed to a real snow family). I even said the word “brutal” and mimicked the knife stabbing gesture. The officers seemed to be skeptical, so I offered to show the documentary to them. We could make popcorn. Instead, they just took sticks and poked the lumps in the snow, making sure there were indeed no real bodies underneath, and then picked up the knives and smelled the food coloring on the pointy parts.
They left without arresting me, but not before a lot of hesitation. I never learned if they found that elderly man, I sure hope they did.
So — here’s the news you can use part — the next time you stage a murder scene in your backyard for entertainment purposes, clean it up before the cops come around asking questions.
With this sage advice, I sent my boys outside with a couple of knives, red food coloring and a smile. As they went out the door, I waved and said, in my most motherly voice, “Bye, boys! Make it look real!”

Texto completo: Do you remember your first magazine subscription? I remember mine. It was Seventeen magazine. I couldn't wait for a new edition to arrive in the mail. Flipping through the glossy pages of the latest fashion trends, makeup tips, and real-life issues that only teenagers could understand. Those were the days. Now I resort to briefly reading headlines while I wait in line at the grocery store. Definitely not the same feeling.
Luckily, Shreve Memorial Library offers numerous periodicals and magazines for me to browse through while I'm visiting, and I love magazines. They are quick reads and are full of information, current trends, helpful tips, funny anecdotes, and needed inspiration. Each Shreve Memorial Library branch carries many popular titles on a wide variety of subjects.

More from Less by Andrew McAfee (non-fiction)
From the coauthor of the New York Times bestseller The Second Machine Age, a compelling argument-masterfully researched and brilliantly articulated – that we have at last learned how to increase human prosperity while treading more lightly on our planet. Throughout history, the only way for humanity to grow was by degrading the Earth: chopping down forests, fouling the air and water, and endlessly digging out resources. Since the first Earth Day in 1970, the reigning argument has been that taking better care of the planet means radically changing course: reducing our consumption, tightening our belts, learning to share and reuse, restraining growth. Is that argument correct? Absolutely not. In More from Less, McAfee argues that to solve our ecological problems we don't need to make radical changes. Instead, we need to do more of what we're already doing: growing technologically sophisticated market-based economies around the world. More from Less is a revelatory, paradigm-shifting account of how we've stumbled into an unexpectedly better balance with nature – one that holds out the promise of more abundant and greener centuries ahead.
Mind Games by Nancy Mehl (fiction)
Kaely Quinn's talents as an FBI behavior analyst are impossible to ignore, no matter how unorthodox her methods. But when a reporter outs her as the daughter of an infamous serial killer, she's demoted to field agent and transferred to St. Louis. When the same reporter who ruined her career claims to have received an anonymous poem predicting a string of murders, ending with Kaely's, the reporter's ulterior motives bring his claim into question. But when a body is found that fits the poem's predictions, the threat is undeniable, and the FBI sends Special Agent Noah Hunter to St. Louis. Initially resentful of the assignment, Noah is surprised at how quickly his respect for Kaely grows, despite her oddities. But with a brazen serial killer who breaks all the normal patterns on the loose, Noah and Kaely are tested to their limits to catch the murderer before anyone else – including Kaely herself – is killed.
Mosaic by Caro Ramsay (fiction)

Texto completo: Doris Miller was a pioneer and a hero at Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. Navy is expected to honor him Monday in Hawaii.
The Navy is expected to name a $12.5 billion aircraft carrier after Miller, the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. Miller, 22, a mess attendant 2nd Class when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, manned a machine gun on the USS West Virginia to return fire at the attacking planes, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported.
Miller was born Oct. 12, 1919, in Waco, Texas, and excelled as a high school football player, according to the Doris Miller Memorial in Waco. He enlisted in the Navy in 1939 and was assigned to the West Virginia, where he cooked, swabbed the decks and shined officers’ shoes, according to The New York Times.

In a historic moment just in time for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, @SECNAV announces that the newest #USNavy aircraft carrier will be named USS Doris Miller #CVN81. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross.

At the time of Miller’s enlistment, black sailors were not allowed to serve in combat positions.
That changed when Japanese planes began strafing the battleships moored at Pearl Harbor just before 8 a.m. on Dec. 7, 1941.
With no prior training, Miller operated “a .50-caliber Browning antiaircraft machine gun until he ran out of ammunition and was ordered to abandon ship,” according to the Navy.
“It wasn’t hard,” Miller said, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website. “I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine. I had watched the others with these guns. I guess I fired her for about 15 minutes.”
There were 1,541 men on board the West Virginia, and 130 died, the Times reported. An additional 52 were injured.
Of the 1,541 men aboard the ship at the time, 130 were killed and 52 were wounded.
Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, presented the Navy Cross to Miller on board the USS Enterprise in Pearl Harbor on May 27, 1942, the Star-Advertiser reported.
After Pearl Harbor, Miller served on the USS Indianapolis, the newspaper reported. On Nov. 24, 1943, he was killed during the Battle of Makin when a Japanese torpedo sank the Liscome Bay, which was escorting the Indianapolis, the Times reported. He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart, according to the Navy.
"I think that Doris Miller is an American hero simply because of what he represents as a young man going beyond the call of what’s expected,” Doreen Ravenscroft, president of Cultural Arts and team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial, told the Star-Advertiser.
Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement, including 66-year-old Flosetta Miller, Stars & Stripes reported.

When fat men’s clubs were big

Texto completo: <img class="size-large wp-image-13181194" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/fat-men-1-1024x792.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="792" />
During the mid to late 1880s and early 1900s, fat men’s clubs had a hefty presence in the U.S.
A newspaper in Indiana in 1870 reported that the Fat Men’s Association of New York had agreed that men had to weigh at least 200 pounds to join. But, its members genially allowed that “a falling off shall not be good cause for expelling a member.”
At their Christmas ball in 1869, The New York Times noted the “ponderous movement of the Titans dancing” and their joy at the table where “they joined heartily in their devotions to the voracious deity from whom they derived their inspiration and their fat.”
Many other groups of large fellows met around the nation, from the Fat Men’s Base-Ball Club in tiny White Pine, Nevada, in 1870, to the jolly New England Fat Men’s Club that led the annual parade at the Vermont State Fair in 1911.
By the late 1800s, there were many fat men’s clubs, with more than 10,000 members in New England alone. Presidential candidates such as William Jennings Bryan and William Howard Taft spoke at some of their gatherings.
In 1904, the Lewiston Evening Journal wrote about a basketball game in Livermore Falls that drew a big crowd to see the Fat Men and the Professional Men compete on the court. “The cheering was deafening,” the paper reported, though it’s not clear which side more people rooted for.
Games between lean and fat men were common across America at the time. The U.S. Senate even took note of the phenomena.
During an 1871 debate on whether federal law should require integrated schools and churches, an Ohio senator, Allen Thurman, took issue with the notion, using the fat men’s clubs as an example.
“There is in the city of New York, I believe, a club of fat men, and no man is allowed to be a member unless he weighs 300 pounds,” the senator said, getting his facts wrong.
The Senate burst into laughter.
<img class="size-medium wp-image-13149278" src="https://multifiles.pressherald.com/uploads/sites/10/2019/12/Fat-Men-s-Polka-page-001-232x300.jpg" alt="" width="232" height="300" />
“Is that an infringement of the rights and privileges of the lean men?” Thurman asked his colleagues. “Must Congress pass a law to force the lean men on those fat fellows in the social intercourse of their club, and in the enjoyment of all its rights, privileges and immunities?”
That drew another round of laughter from senators.
The custom of plump people gathering together apparently had deep roots.
In 1721, English essayist Joseph Addison, writing in The Spectator, mentioned “a Club of fat men” that met in “a considerable market-town.”
They came together, he said at the time, “to keep one another in countenance,” not for any sprightliness or wit. Its rule was men who could fit through a single door were unfit to join, but those who required entrance through a pair of folding doors were “saluted as a brother.”
“I have heard that this club, though it contained but 15 persons, weighed above three tons.”
Addison added that in opposition to the club, a competing one of “Scarecrows and Skeletons” had formed, “being very meager and envious.”
As late as the Great Depression, occasional news stories about fat men’s clubs appeared in the press.
When business slumped in 1931, the Associated Press reported that the United States Fat Men’s Club’s 1,472 members collectively lost more than 3,600 pounds, a sign of some real belt-tightening in those hard times.
The club’s president, Carl Shaw of Boston, told the AP that “to get back to parity the club wants new members: big, plump, hefty ones.”
But it didn’t find them.
Once huge, fat men’s clubs quietly withered away.
Or perhaps corpulence became so ubiquitous that special clubs seemed pointless.
After all, according to the yearly findings of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the average American man between the ages of 40 and 60 now weighs 201 pounds.
In short, a typical American male these days would have been heartily welcomed into the Fat Men’s Club when it formed 150 years ago.

El ‘impeachment’ de Trump en el Senado no se podrá seguir al completo y desde todos los ángulos

Texto completo: La cobertura del juicio político a Donald Trump en el Senado ya empezó a causar polémica en sus inicios la semana pasada. Pero el tema aún no se ha solucionado y los reporteros que cubren el ‘impeachment‘ aún no saben con exactitud cuáles serán las restricciones .
La preocupación de los periodistas es que los límites que les imponga el Capitolio no les permita entrevistar a los legisladores sobre los procedimientos. Pero las reglas, que están negociando los líderes republicanos en el senado, también han generado incertidumbre entre la policía del Capitolio , encarga de hacerlas cumplir.
Incluso la cadena C-SPAN, normalmente tranquila, se ha visto afectada y ha pedido al Senado que permita a sus equipos de televisión retransmitir y documentar el juicio. Temen que, tal y como pasó hace 21 años en el juicio de Bill Clinton, las cámaras del gobierno limiten lo que los espectadores ven y oyen .
Según The New York Times, al contrario que la Casa Blanca, el Senado había sido hasta ahora un lugar seguro para la prensa que ha sido tratada con cordialidad en esta cámara. Sin embargo, parece que la hostilidad de la Casa Blanca se ha transmitido a los senadores .
“Hemos entendido durante mucho tiempo que en el fondo ambos servimos a las mismas personas y que es una relación de beneficio mutuo”, dice Sarah Wire, la reportera de Los Angeles Times que lidera el comité de los corresponsales del Congreso.
Los reporteros no podrán acceder a los pasillos del Congreso, como han hecho durante décadas, sino que estarán confinados en áreas restringidas mientras los senadores van y vienen al juicio . También se acortarán las entrevistas de pie de los senadores.
“ Así de ridículas son estas restricciones “, dijo la semana pasada en Twitter la reportara Emma Dumai. Un oficial del Capitolio interrumpió una entrevista que Dumai hacía a un senador para pedirle que se pusiera “detrás de una cuerda”.

Texto completo: Las imprudencias de Facebook siguen a la orden del día.
La red social tuvo que disculparse el fin de semana por ofender al presidente de China Xi Jinping con una traducción de su sistema.
Según el New York Times, el error salió a la luz cuando Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , líder de Myanmar, hizo una publicación en Facebook sobre la visita de Xi a esa nación. La traducción al inglés de Señor Xi se leía como “Mr. Shithole” que en español sería algo como “Sr. Agujero de mierda”. La expresión “Shithole” es usada de manera despectiva para referirse a poblaciones.

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — At the center of Michael Powell’s engrossing book “Canyon Dreams: A Basketball Season on the Navajo Nation” is the Chinle, Arizona, high school basketball team during the 2017-18 school year.
The book looks at – and behind – the on-court dreams of the individual players, their coach, Raul Mendoza, and the nervous excitement of extended families, friends and former players who make up the team’s thousands of fans. They share a recurring dream – win the state championship.
Powell interviewed players, each with his own personal off-court post-high school dream and considered how and why basketball on the reservation influences their lives.
“I knew that basketball was big on the reservation, having lived there,” Powell said. He and his family had lived in Fort Defiance, where his wife worked as a midwife.
He soon found out just how big.
In 2015, Powell first met Mendoza when he coached Window Rock boys in a varsity game against Chinle.
“We just hit it off,’ Powell said. “Mendoza has a wonderful sense” of being inside – yet outside – Navajo culture. Mendoza is Tohono O’odham, married to a Navajo.
Powell wrote a feature story on rez basketball, but realized he wanted to return to the reservation to, as he put, “dive deeper” into this subject for a book.
“I was waiting for something urgent, internally. This story (about Chinle) was that. It spoke to me. Made me want to spend a lot of time there. With his wife and two young sons, Powell moved to Chinle; they stayed from the end of October 2017 to mid-March 2018.
“We had a more intimate interaction with the Navajo culture, and I’m fascinated by history and culture and how that plays out,” Powell said. He found the Navajos open to his questions, despite his being “a Type A New York personality.” And he had to be open to their ways.
He recalled dinners with a family or just conversing with family members. “These are family gatherings, with a broad cross section of family, the aunties, the uncles and the cousins. … I had conversations with several medicine men that were wonderfully loosely jointed and rambling,” Powell said.
Powell learned just how much prep basketball means to the Chinle boys and girls. “It looms so large culturally in their lives,” he said. “High school basketball is their peak, athletically. And you represent your family, your clan, your community.”
Powell gave an example of the impact a game day has on reservation life. Many Chinle fans would head to the gym to watch the ninth-grade boys and girls play, followed by the JV boys and girls, and then the varsity girls and boys.
“You have a lot of people who sit for five hours and cheer on everybody,” he said.
The “canyon” in the book title is Canyon de Chelly National Monument on Navajo land in northeastern Arizona. The town of Chinle abuts the canyon.
Powell has been a writer for the New York Times since 2007 and has been a “Sports of the Times” columnist since 2014. He was part of a newspaper team that won a Pulitzer Prize.
An excerpt from the book focusing on a Chinle varsity boys road trip to Holbrook, Arizona, appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 6.

Texto completo: Las imprudencias de Facebook siguen a la orden del día.
La red social tuvo que disculparse el fin de semana por ofender al presidente de China Xi Jinping con una traducción de su sistema.
Según el New York Times, el error salió a la luz cuando Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , líder de Myanmar, hizo una publicación en Facebook sobre la visita de Xi a esa nación. La traducción al inglés de Señor Xi se leía como “Mr. Shithole” que en español sería algo como “Sr. Agujero de mierda”. La expresión “Shithole” es usada de manera despectiva para referirse a poblaciones.

Texto completo: ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — Grammy Award-winning guitarist Jason Vieaux will perform what he considers a future classic when he takes the stage of Popejoy Hall on Saturday, Jan. 25.
The world-renowned musician will play Baltimore-based composer Jonathan Leshnoff’s “Guitar Concerto,” along with a more familiar work, Vivaldi’s Concerto in D Major, RV 93, originally written for lute, with the New Mexico Philharmonic. The orchestra will play Mozart’s “Overture to the Marriage of Figaro” and his Symphonies No. 25 and 35, the “Haffner.”
“Jonathan Leshnoff is a fantastic composer,” the guitarist said in a phone interview from his Cleveland home. “He’s had quite a lot of success with major orchestras performing his work.”
Vieaux recorded the concerto with the Nashville Symphony in 2019.
“It’s really a star vehicle for guitar and orchestra,” Vieaux continued. “The melodic lines are as virtuosic as (Spanish composer Joaquín) Rodrigo. It can be very dramatic and sweeping, almost cinematic in scope.”
The New York Times deemed Leshnoff “a leader of contemporary American lyricism.”
Vieaux grew up in Buffalo, N.Y., listening to his mother’s Beatles and soul records, as well as his father’s jazz recordings. His mother bought him a guitar when he was 5 years old. Then the Buffalo Guitar Quartet came to his school when he was 7.
“We didn’t know there was such a thing as classical guitar,” he said. By the age of 8, he was studying with quartet guitarist Jeremy Sparks.
“I just absorbed it,” he said. “I got this sense that what I was actually studying was much more difficult note for note than playing a Zeppelin riff.”
By age 12, Vieaux was giving full-length recitals around Buffalo. At 14, he was playing with the Buffalo Philharmonic.
Today, he has performed as the soloist with more than 100 orchestras and at guitar festivals in Asia, Australia, Europe and Mexico. He was the first classical musician to play on NPR’s “Tiny Desk” concert series. Vieaux teaches at both Philadelphia’s Curtis Institute (he co-founded the classical guitar department) and at the Cleveland Institute of Music. In 2012 he launched the first online classical guitar academy for ArtistWorks.
For 25 years, Vieaux has sliced a crescent from a ping-pong ball whenever he breaks a thumbnail.
“It’s very rare to grow perfect, God-given nails,” he said. “That’s the number one substitute.”
His next CD will be “Bach, Volume II,” a collection of the composer’s works for violin. No release date has been set.

Texto completo: La cobertura del juicio político a Donald Trump en el Senado ya empezó a causar polémica en sus inicios la semana pasada. Pero el tema aún no se ha solucionado y los reporteros que cubren el ‘impeachment‘ aún no saben con exactitud cuáles serán las restricciones .
La preocupación de los periodistas es que los límites que les imponga el Capitolio no les permita entrevistar a los legisladores sobre los procedimientos. Pero las reglas, que están negociando los líderes republicanos en el senado, también han generado incertidumbre entre la policía del Capitolio , encarga de hacerlas cumplir.
Incluso la cadena C-SPAN, normalmente tranquila, se ha visto afectada y ha pedido al Senado que permita a sus equipos de televisión retransmitir y documentar el juicio. Temen que, tal y como pasó hace 21 años en el juicio de Bill Clinton, las cámaras del gobierno limiten lo que los espectadores ven y oyen .
Según The New York Times, al contrario que la Casa Blanca, el Senado había sido hasta ahora un lugar seguro para la prensa que ha sido tratada con cordialidad en esta cámara. Sin embargo, parece que la hostilidad de la Casa Blanca se ha transmitido a los senadores .
“Hemos entendido durante mucho tiempo que en el fondo ambos servimos a las mismas personas y que es una relación de beneficio mutuo”, dice Sarah Wire, la reportera de Los Angeles Times que lidera el comité de los corresponsales del Congreso.
Los reporteros no podrán acceder a los pasillos del Congreso, como han hecho durante décadas, sino que estarán confinados en áreas restringidas mientras los senadores van y vienen al juicio . También se acortarán las entrevistas de pie de los senadores.
“ Así de ridículas son estas restricciones “, dijo la semana pasada en Twitter la reportara Emma Dumai. Un oficial del Capitolio interrumpió una entrevista que Dumai hacía a un senador para pedirle que se pusiera “detrás de una cuerda”.

Krugman: The shameful treatment of America’s children

Texto completo: The other day a correspondent asked me a good question: What important issue aren’t we talking about? My answer, after some reflection, is the state of America’s children.
Now, it’s not entirely fair to say that we’re ignoring the plight of our children. Elizabeth Warren, characteristically, has laid out a comprehensive, fully financed plan for universal child care. Bernie Sanders, also characteristically, says he’s for it but hasn’t provided details. And as far as I can tell, all the other Democratic presidential candidates support doing more for children.
But policy toward children has attracted far less media attention than the debate over “Medicare for All,” which won’t become reality anytime soon — let alone the so-called Warren-Sanders “spat.” And my guess is that even well-informed voters have little sense of the grim exceptionalism of America’s child-oriented policies, which are Dickensian compared with those of every other advanced country.
A few numbers may be in order here.
Every advanced country mandates some form of paid leave for new mothers, typically three or four months — every country, that is, except the United States, which offers no maternity leave at all.
Most advanced countries devote substantial sums to benefits for families with children; in Europe these benefits average between 2% and 3% percent of gross domestic product. The corresponding number for the United States is 0.6% of GDP.
Even where the United States does help children, the quality of that help tends to be poor. There have been many comparisons between French and American school lunches: French schoolchildren are taught to eat healthy meals; American children are basically treated as a disposal site for farm surpluses.
What’s especially striking is the contrast between the way we treat our children and the way we treat our senior citizens. Social Security isn’t all that generous — there’s a good case for expanding it — but it doesn’t compare too badly with other countries’ retirement systems. Medicare actually spends lavishly compared with single-payer systems elsewhere.
So America’s refusal to help children isn’t part of a broad opposition to government programs; we single out children for especially harsh treatment. Why?
The answer, I’d suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can’t vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a poisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis.
These days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even before immigration transformed the U.S. ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.
This perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in U.S. inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.
The result was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most.
At this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. Sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused not by culture but by the disappearance of good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the U.S. heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.
What this means is that we’ve established a basically vicious system under which children can’t get the help they need unless their parents find jobs that don’t exist. And a growing body of evidence says that this system is destructive as well as cruel.
Multiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there’s a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.
It’s probably too much to claim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to doing so than tax cuts for the rich.
So we should be talking a lot more about helping America’s children. Why aren’t we?
At least part of the blame rests with Bernie Sanders, who made Medicare for All both a progressive purity test and a bright shiny object chased by the news media at the expense of other policies that could greatly improve American lives, and are far more likely to become law. But it’s not too late to refocus.
Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, I hope he or she will give our nation’s shameful treatment of children the attention it deserves.

Texto completo: This is a golden age for “Theyism.” This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite “they” out there and “they” are destroying life for the rest of us.
There is Donald Trump’s culture-war Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our values and opening our borders. And there is Bernie Sanders’ class-war Theyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and impoverish everyone else.
Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in society and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of America is trying to destroy the other part.
The Republican Party has been swallowed by Trump’s culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sanders’ class war.
These Democrats are doing this even though it is political suicide. Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing voters in the Midwest care more about their values — guns, patriotism, ending abortion, masculinity, whatever — than they do about proletarian class consciousness.
Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story is wrong.
Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as they negotiate wages with their employers. But then he blows this up into an all-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which capitalist power completely dominates worker power. This ideology crashes against the facts.
In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for those toward the top. If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?
Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity. For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34% and wages in those industries rose by 26%. Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20% while wages grew by 24%.
As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, capitalism is doing what it’s supposed to do. It is rewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive. If you improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run people can’t earn what they don’t produce.
Third, and most important, most of the increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within them. As John Van Reenen of MIT has found, all over the world superstar businesses are racing ahead of their competitors. As those companies grow more productive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more. Companies that can’t match that productivity don’t, and their workers lag behind.
A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that there is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody else. Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, productivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very strong. Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market shares. But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies. Workers in those businesses suffer.
Today’s successful bosses are doing what they should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and offering great service. A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a smaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workers’ wages. In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge.
Thus, the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; it’s the rise of productivity inequality. It’s the companies and individuals who don’t have the skills to take advantage of new technologies.
The real solution, therefore, is not class war to hammer successful businesses. It’s to boost and expand productivity for everybody else. That’s done the old-fashioned way — by having better schools and better vocational training, by having more open competitive markets, by creating incentives to expand investment, by making sure superstar businesses don’t use lobbyists to lock in their advantages.
I understand if you want to stick to an us-versus-them political ideology. It’s emotionally satisfying to base your political ideology on blaming people you dislike. In fact, I strongly recommend Michael Lind’s new book, “The New Class War,” which is the best version of us/them.
Lind makes a lot of vague generalizations about the “managerial elite,” which he blames for our problems. But at least he’s interesting and provocative. At least he understands that a politically plausible “Theyism” is economically left and socially right — combining the culture war and class war into a tidy narrative.
But if you want to deal with our real problems, stop the us/them warfare and start dealing with productivity inequality.
Successful executives are doing what’s best for their companies, gathering as much talent as they can. This isn’t evil. It’s not exploitation.
The job of public policy is to make it easier for everybody to do what successful people are doing. Productivity is the key to national prosperity. Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.

Texto completo: La cobertura del juicio político a Donald Trump en el Senado ya empezó a causar polémica en sus inicios la semana pasada. Pero el tema aún no se ha solucionado y los reporteros que cubren el ‘impeachment‘ aún no saben con exactitud cuáles serán las restricciones .
La preocupación de los periodistas es que los límites que les imponga el Capitolio no les permita entrevistar a los legisladores sobre los procedimientos. Pero las reglas, que están negociando los líderes republicanos en el senado, también han generado incertidumbre entre la policía del Capitolio , encarga de hacerlas cumplir.
Incluso la cadena C-SPAN, normalmente tranquila, se ha visto afectada y ha pedido al Senado que permita a sus equipos de televisión retransmitir y documentar el juicio. Temen que, tal y como pasó hace 21 años en el juicio de Bill Clinton, las cámaras del gobierno limiten lo que los espectadores ven y oyen .
Según The New York Times, al contrario que la Casa Blanca, el Senado había sido hasta ahora un lugar seguro para la prensa que ha sido tratada con cordialidad en esta cámara. Sin embargo, parece que la hostilidad de la Casa Blanca se ha transmitido a los senadores .
“Hemos entendido durante mucho tiempo que en el fondo ambos servimos a las mismas personas y que es una relación de beneficio mutuo”, dice Sarah Wire, la reportera de Los Angeles Times que lidera el comité de los corresponsales del Congreso.
Los reporteros no podrán acceder a los pasillos del Congreso, como han hecho durante décadas, sino que estarán confinados en áreas restringidas mientras los senadores van y vienen al juicio . También se acortarán las entrevistas de pie de los senadores.
“ Así de ridículas son estas restricciones “, dijo la semana pasada en Twitter la reportara Emma Dumai. Un oficial del Capitolio interrumpió una entrevista que Dumai hacía a un senador para pedirle que se pusiera “detrás de una cuerda”.

Texto completo: Las imprudencias de Facebook siguen a la orden del día.
La red social tuvo que disculparse el fin de semana por ofender al presidente de China Xi Jinping con una traducción de su sistema.
Según el New York Times, el error salió a la luz cuando Daw Aung San Suu Kyi , líder de Myanmar, hizo una publicación en Facebook sobre la visita de Xi a esa nación. La traducción al inglés de Señor Xi se leía como “Mr. Shithole” que en español sería algo como “Sr. Agujero de mierda”. La expresión “Shithole” es usada de manera despectiva para referirse a poblaciones.

“Hemos arreglado un problema técnico que causó traducciones incorrectas del birmano al inglés en Facebook”, dijo Andy Stone, vocero de Facebook. “Esto no debió pasar y estamos tomando medidas para que no vuelve a suceder”.
El mismo texto al ser traducido en Google no generaba el mismo error. El traductor de Facebook cuando se enfrenta a palabras que no tienen traducción lo que hace es traducir sílabas. La compañía dijo que al revisar el sistema palabras en birmano con “Xi”o “Shi” generaban la vulgaridad en inglés.

Injustice Is A Threat To Justice

Texto completo: Editor: Our statutory sentencing laws consistently designate “life imprisonment” as a “maximum” sentence in accord with the Pennsylvania Constitution, which clearly states “life imprisonment” is a “maximum” sentence. Is life imprisonment a maximum sentence?
Even without considering the incontrovertible fact our courts have inhumanely turned life-with-parole sentences into life-without-parole sentences from them bench by ruling life imprisonment is a minimum sentence in patent violation of our own Constitution and laws, many other Americans have noted the stark injustice of life-without-parole sentences.
“Life without parole is a very strange sentence when you think about it. The punishment seems either too much or too little. If a sadistic or extraordinarily cold, callous killer deserves to die, then why not kill him? But if we are going to keep the killer alive when we could otherwise execute him, why strip him of all hope?” Robert Blecker wrote in “Serving Life with No Chance of Redemption” in The New York Times in 2005.
This is reminiscent of what the most famous wrongfully convicted innocent man in all of history had to say shortly before he was executed. “Forgive them Father, for they know not what they do.”
So, as a lifer myself, I also pray for those who, with their actions and inactions, are responsible for inhumanely punishing thousands of Pennsylvania lifers “too much” by stripping them “of all hope” in flagrant violation of unambiguous statutory requirements, constitutional mandates and our humanity. This is un-American and un-Christian.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, “Injustice is a threat to justice everywhere.” Bob Dylan wrote, “How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn’t see?”
What do you see? Justice of injustice? Will you do something about it, or turn your head, pretending you just don’t see?

Texto completo: If you live with or work with someone who suffers from migraines, there’s something very important you should know: A migraine is not “just a headache,” as many seem to think. Nor is it something most sufferers can simply ignore and get on with their lives.
And if you are a migraine sufferer, there’s something potentially life-changing that you should know: There are now a number of medications available that can either prevent or alleviate many attacks, as well as a newly marketed wearable nerve-stimulating device that can be activated by a smartphone to relieve the pain of a migraine.
Migraine is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of severe, often incapacitating headache and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which controls the body’s automatic activities like digestion and breathing. The throbbing or pulsating pain of migraine is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.
Translation: Migraine is a headache, all right, but with bodywide effects because the brain converses with the rest of the body. It is often severe enough to exact a devastating toll on someone’s ability to work, interact with others, perform the tasks of daily life or even be in a normal living environment. When in the throes of a migraine attack, sufferers may be unable to tolerate light, noise, smells or even touch.
“There are 47 million people in this country with migraine, and for 6 million, the condition is chronic, which means they have more than 15 headache days a month,” said Dr. Stephen Silberstein, a neurologist at Thomas Jefferson University and director of the Jefferson Headache Center in Philadelphia.
Dr. David W. Dodick, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, Arizona, said: “It’s time to destigmatize migraine and provide sufferers with effective treatment. They’re not fakers, weak individuals who are trying to get out of work.”
In addition to the price paid by individuals with migraines, the cost to employers can be exorbitant. For example, in a recent survey by the Japanese Headache Society of more than 2,400 workers at Fujitsu, an information technology company based in Tokyo, the productivity of 1 in 5 employees was impaired by migraines, at an estimated cost to the company of nearly 150,000 employees of $350 million a year.
For the United States as a whole, the economic burden exacted by migraines is staggering - at least $11 billion in direct medical and related costs and at least another $11 billion in indirect costs from the disability it causes, according to Dr. Wayne N. Burton of Chicago, former global corporate medical director at American Express.
The condition results not only in absenteeism, but also in what specialists call “presenteeism” - people who are at work but unable to function effectively. A former editor of mine with migraines had to leave the office as soon as he sensed an impending migraine or he would be unable to get home until it resolved.
Though that was decades ago, today there still are several reasons migraines are poorly controlled for so many people. One is a lack of appreciation by both doctors and the public for what it entails, which can discourage patients from seeking treatment. Another is a tendency for migraine sufferers to assume they can or should be able to deal with the problem on their own, either with over-the-counter or prescription drugs.
Resulting from that assumption, Silberstein said, is yet another stumbling block - an abuse of medication, which can actually make the condition worse. “Half the patients with chronic migraine overuse the treatment based on surveys we’ve done,” he said.
On the other hand, he said, when an attack is imminent, many people wait too long to initiate treatment “because they’re in denial and hope the headache will go away on its own.”
“But the longer you wait,” he added, “the harder it is to get relief.”
But perhaps the main problem is a paucity of medical experts - 580 specialists, or one doctor for every 80,000 people with migraines, who are conversant with the condition and available therapies, Dodick said. Even if patients can find an expert, a lot of insurance plans don’t cover certified headache specialists.
Thus, too often, patients with an excruciating migraine end up in a hospital’s emergency room, which Silberstein called “the worst place to go when you have a migraine, with all the lights, noise, activity and the wait.”
As Dodick said, “The brain amplifies the signals coming in, intensifying the pain and symptoms throughout the body.”
There are four oral drugs in two classes that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of migraines: two anti-seizure drugs and two beta-blockers. And patients with chronic migraines who have symptoms every day or every other day can get injections of Botox.
“Forty percent of people with migraine should be on preventive medication,” Silberstein said, “but only 13% get it.”

Texto completo: Representatives from Brazil’s scientific community and government will head to Antarctica this month to inaugurate its new Comandante Ferraz Research Station, which replaces a facility lost to fire in 2012. The two low-slung buildings, designed by Estudio 41, a Brazilian architecture firm, house laboratories, operational support and living quarters - and could be mistaken for an art museum or a boutique hotel.
“Brazil is a tropical country, so we were not used to these conditions,” said Emerson Vidigal, a principal at the firm.
“These conditions” include temperatures that drop below minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit and winds that reach 100 mph.
Throughout the 20th century, architecture in Antarctica was a pragmatic, largely makeshift affair, focused on keeping the elements out and the occupants alive. In 1959, the Antarctic Treaty dedicated the continent to research. Since then scientists have come in growing numbers, with ever more complex needs. Construction in Antarctica, long the purview of engineers, is now attracting designer architects.
“As architects, we are concerned with human comfort, so we set out to create a kind of atmosphere that would promote well-being,” Vidigal said.
When British explorers built one of the first permanent structures there, in 1902, they insulated it with felt and clad it in wood. As accumulating snow rendered the door impassable, the crew resorted to using a window to come and go.
That sense of improvisation continued for decades. In 1956, Britain’s Royal Society founded Halley Research Station, but the facility was covered in snow by 1961 and was shut down in 1968. A replacement, Halley II, was reinforced with steel supports, but its life span was even shorter, from 1967 to 1973. Halley III lasted for 11 years, Halley IV for nine, and Halley V for nearly 15, with each rebuilding effort presenting a costly, complex undertaking.
When, in 2005, Halley needed rebuilding again, the British Antarctic Survey, which operates Britain’s Antarctic footprint, took a novel approach, teaming up with the Royal Institute of British Architects to sponsor a design competition. The winner, Hugh Broughton Architects, designed Halley VI to last at least 20 years.
In addition to being visually striking, Halley VI provides a more comfortable living and work environment. It is set on hydraulic stilts, allowing operators to lift it up out of accumulating snow drifts. And if the entire station needs to be moved - it sits on an ice shelf - skis at the base of those stilts make that possible.
“Before, these projects were all just about keeping the weather out,” Broughton said. “Engineers would be told, ‘This is the weather, this is the wind speed, these are the restrictions.’ But now these projects are about using architecture as a means of improving both well-being and operational efficiency.”
Other countries have taken note. In 2018, Spain opened a new research station - and hired Broughton’s firm to design it. Like Halley VI, it cuts a strong figure, its modular buildings clad in bright red fiber-reinforced plastic panels.
Not only do these buildings need to withstand some of the world’s most demanding conditions, but building materials need to be shipped in and assembled in the short 12-week window of summer. Most projects are built incrementally over several years.
When India’s National Center for Antarctic and Ocean Research decided to build a new research station, the architecture firm it chose - Bof Architekten of Germany - found a way to make construction more efficient. Rather than send shipping containers full of building materials to Antarctica and send them back empty, the architects integrated the shipping containers into the design.
For the United States, architecture in Antarctica is a matter of some urgency. The largest U.S. station, McMurdo, started out in 1956 as an improvised naval base, grew in an ad hoc manner over decades and needs updating.

Texto completo: Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi used to be Facebook's friends. Not anymore.
A day after Pelosi kicked off a new war of words, calling the social media giant's behavior “shameful” and “irresponsible," Biden ramped up the Democrats' open season on Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, during an interview with the New York Times on Friday.
"I've never been a fan of Facebook," the former vice president said. "I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan. I think he's a real problem. "
A federal law that shields Facebook and other internet companies from being held liable for what’s posted on their platforms should be revoked, Biden also told the newspaper.
During her weekly news conference on Capitol Hill, House Speaker Pelosi had sharp words in response to a question about Facebook's power.
“I think what they have said very blatantly, very clearly is that they intend to be accomplices for misleading the American people with money from God knows where,” Pelosi said.
Facebook disinformation in 2020: What you can do to stop its spread
Facebook declined to comment on Pelosi’s remarks. It could not be immediately reached about Biden’s criticism.
Not long ago, Facebook and its executive team including chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were praised by the Democratic leadership.
But soon after the 2016 presidential election, tensions emerged. The problem? A wave of scandals, starting with rampant misinformation and Russian interference during the election that favored Donald Trump and undercut his Democratic challenger, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Then came Facebook’s assist to Trump’s presidential campaign, the leak of millions of Facebook users’ personal information to Cambridge Analytica and data breaches.
Growing scrutiny of Facebook’s dominance has come from both sides of the aisle. Zuckerberg, who has mounted a charm offensive on Capitol Hill and the White House, has been a magnet for criticism.
Last week, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said the Facebook co-founder has gained too much power.
Fueling the tensions: Facebook’s refusal in May to remove a doctored video of Pelosi that made it sound like she was slurring her words. Then, Facebook said it would not fact-check ads from politicians ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Many Democrats see that policy benefiting Trump’s reelection campaign.
Biden’s campaign demanded Facebook remove a false ad from the Trump campaign accusing him of corruption for his role in Ukraine policy during the Obama administration. Facebook refused.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic presidential candidate, highlighted the problem by running an intentionally fake ad claiming Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump's reelection.
During an interview with "CBS This Morning" this month, Zuckerberg reiterated the company's belief that it should not censor politicians.
"What I believe is that in a democracy, it’s really important that people can see for themselves what politicians are saying, so they can make their open judgments," Zuckerberg said.
In an op-ed for USA TODAY, Facebook said scrutinizing the public speech of politicians is “a good thing. ”
“But for that to happen, the public and the news media have to see it. In fact, if Facebook became the gatekeeper of truth, the first people to complain would be those who are complaining now – for good reason. ”
Pelosi was not having it on Thursday, accusing Facebook of putting profits above all else.
“I think they have been very abusive of the great opportunity that technology has given them,” she said. “All they want is their tax cuts and no antitrust action against them. They schmooze this administration in that regard because so far that is what they’ve received. ”

The Bernie Sanders fallacy

Texto completo: This is a golden age for "Theyism." This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite "they" out there and "they" are destroying life for the rest of us.
There is Donald Trump's culture-war Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our values and opening our borders. And there is Bernie Sanders' class-war Theyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and impoverish everyone else.
Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in society and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of America is trying to destroy the other part.
The Republican Party has been swallowed by Trump's culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sanders' class war.
These Democrats are doing this even though it is political suicide. Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing voters in the Midwest care more about their values - guns, patriotism, ending abortion, masculinity, whatever - than they do about proletarian class consciousness.
Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story is wrong.
Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as they negotiate wages with their employers. But then he blows this up into an all-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which capitalist power completely dominates worker power. This ideology crashes against the facts.
In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for those toward the top. If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?
Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity. For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34% and wages in those industries rose by 26%. Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20% while wages grew by 24%.
As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, capitalism is doing what it's supposed to do. It is rewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive. If you improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run people can't earn what they don't produce.
Third, and most important, most of the increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within them. As John Van Reenen of MIT has found, all over the world superstar businesses are racing ahead of their competitors. As those companies grow more productive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more. Companies that can't match that productivity don't, and their workers lag behind.
A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that there is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody else. Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, productivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very strong. Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market shares. But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies. Workers in those businesses suffer.
Today's successful bosses are doing what they should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and offering great service. A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a smaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workers' wages. In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge.
Thus, the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; it's the rise of productivity inequality. It's the companies and individuals who don't have the skills to take advantage of new technologies.
The real solution, therefore, is not class war to hammer successful businesses. It's to boost and expand productivity for everybody else. That's done the old-fashioned way - by having better schools and better vocational training, by having more open competitive markets, by creating incentives to expand investment, by making sure superstar businesses don't use lobbyists to lock in their advantages.
I understand if you want to stick to an us-versus-them political ideology. It's emotionally satisfying to base your political ideology on blaming people you dislike. In fact, I strongly recommend Michael Lind's new book, "The New Class War," which is the best version of us/them.
Lind makes a lot of vague generalizations about the "managerial elite," which he blames for our problems. But at least he's interesting and provocative. At least he understands that a politically plausible "Theyism" is economically left and socially right - combining the culture war and class war into a tidy narrative.
But if you want to deal with our real problems, stop the us/them warfare and start dealing with productivity inequality.
Successful executives are doing what's best for their companies, gathering as much talent as they can. This isn't evil. It's not exploitation.
The job of public policy is to make it easier for everybody to do what successful people are doing. Productivity is the key to national prosperity. Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.
David Brooks writes a syndicated column for the New York Times.

Gen Z shoppers want cheap and cute

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.
Q: What do you think of sustainable fashion?
A: I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I'm honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

Cancer death rates show a record drop

Texto completo: Cancer remains a dreaded diagnosis, but there's heartening news. America is showing great progress against some of the most deadly forms of the disease, particularly lung cancer and the aggressive skin cancer melanoma.
Researchers have reported the largest-ever one-year decline in the U.S. cancer death rate, according to the American Cancer Society. The rate has fallen resoundingly -- nearly 30 percent -- from 1991 to 2017, affecting nearly 3 million lives. Anyone who lost a loved one to cancer in that quarter-century can applaud this progress.
What drove the improvement? Both personal choices and medical advances contributed, researchers say. Lung cancer is by far the biggest killer of the cancers, and smoking -- which is also implicated in other types of cancer -- has been declining for decades. There are powerful new ways to diagnose and treat lung cancer, and even patients with advanced disease are living longer.
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease. It still claims too many lives and strikes at our hearts in personal or public life.
The report came with some cautions: Death rates have increased for some cancers linked to obesity, including those of the thyroid, pancreas and uterus, The New York Times reports.
On the positive side, the decline in smoking cigarettes, not-that-affectionately known as cancer sticks, should continue to pay off for years to come. The HPV vaccine will continue its march against cervical cancer. Immunotherapy shows great promise.
Cancer is complicated, and the solutions are too. Bad habits, pollution and complex risk factors like obesity won't just go away. But this record year of improvements shows that better choices and investment in more effective -- and less destructive -- ways to diagnose and heal are making a dent.

Texto completo: After taking January off, Northwest Passages is ready to start tackling this year's reading list.
New novels, romance, running, they're all on the schedule. In fact, some of it's so new, you can't buy it yet (but Auntie's Bookstore can help you with preorders).
Here's a look at what's coming up for the book club:
Galentine's Day
In February, Northwest Passages will get between the pages of a romance panel of four bestselling authors who span the romance genre from puppy love to paranormal, and they are all from Spokane:
Asa Maria Bradley, by day a college physics professor, started writing her sexy modern-day "Viking Warriors" paranormal romance series in 2015.
Lucy Gilmore might seem like a relative newcomer to the genre, as she started writing her "Puppy Love" series in 2019, but she has written other romance titles under the name Tamara Morgan since 2012.
Katee Robert is a New York Times and USA Today bestselling author in the contemporary romance genre with the tagline "Seduction, Mischief and Murder."
Rebecca Zanetti writes paranormal and suspenseful romances with more than 25 books about vampires, cowboys and soldiers that have also earned her spots on New York Times and USA Today bestselling book lists.
If you go: 7 p.m. Feb. 24 at the Montvale Event Center, 1019 W. First Ave. The VIP Galentine experience is $20, which includes reserved front row seating, a reception with authors, a glass of wine and special Galentine Day Chocolate. Auntie's will be on hand with a selection of titles from all the authors. General admission is $6.
'American Dirt'
"American Dirt" by Jeanine Cummins is one of the most anticipated releases of 2020. The book tells the story of a mother and son's harrowing journey as migrants crossing the border from Mexico to the United States after their family was killed by a drug cartel.
The book is out this week, and Cummins will be at the Bing Crosby Theater on March 12. Cummins is known for her intricate stories of characters who survive tragic circumstances.
Her debut book was "A Rip in Heaven," a memoir of her experiences as a 16-year-old after her family experienced a heartbreaking crime. She's also published the novels "The Outside Boy" and "The Crooked Branch."
If you go: 7 p.m. March 12 at the Bing Crosby Theater, 901 W. Sprague Ave. VIP tickets are $50 and include a copy of the book, reserved seat and a glass of wine at a reception at Ovations with the author. General admission is $6.
'Eden Mine'
When S.M. Hulse, author of "Black River," participated in Summer Stories last August, she let slip that her new novel, "Eden Mine," was due to debut in late February.
Set in a small Montana town, the novel shows how faith prevails when violence literally tears apart the community and a siblings' bond. On March 18, Northwest Passages will host Hulse at the Montvale Event Center.
If you go: 7 p.m. March 18 at the Montvale Event Center, 1019 W. First Ave. VIP tickets are $45 and include a copy of the book, a reserved seat and a glass of wine at a reception. General admission is $6.
'Spirit Run'
Hold the date of April 30. Northwest Passages will be hosting a discussion with Noé Álvarez about his debut memoir, "Spirit Run: A 6,000-Mile Marathon Through North America's Stolen Land," set to be released in March. Álvarez was born to Mexican immigrant parents and raised working-class in Yakima.

The Oscars' long history of getting called out for lack of diversity

Texto completo: It's Oscars season. And, once again, critics are pointing out the lack of racial diversity among the nominees.

While the conversation about representation during awards season has become more prominent in recent years, artists have long called out the Academy Awards for doing a poor job of recognizing the work of people who aren't white.

Only one black actor received a nomination this year: Cynthia Erivo for best actress for "Harriet" (she also received a nod for best song).

"It's not enough that I'm the only one. It just isn't," she told the New York Times this week, noting "far too much work was done this year by incredible women and men of color that should be celebrated."

Her words echoed Eddie Murphy's from the 1988 Oscars ceremony. Before presenting the winner for best picture, Murphy told the audience that he initially declined the invitation from the academy, and re-enacted the conversation he had with his manager about it: " ‘I'm not going (to the Oscars) because they haven't recognized black people in motion pictures.' He said, ‘What are you talking about? Black people win Oscars!' I said, ‘Well, black actors and actresses have won Oscars throughout 60 years -- it was like Hattie McDaniel won the first one, then Sidney Poitier won one and Louis Gossett (Jr.)," Murphy said. (McDaniel won in 1940, Poitier in 1964 and Gossett in 1983.)

Murphy continued: "I'll probably never win an Oscar for saying this but, hey, what the hey, I gotta say it. Actually, I might not be in any trouble because the way it's been going, every 20 years we get one, so we ain't due (till) about 2004 -- so by then, this will have all blown over."

His manager insisted he couldn't "snub the academy," so Murphy agreed to present the award, but added: "I just want you to know that I'm gonna give this award, but black people will not ride the caboose of society, and we will not bring up the rear anymore. I want you to recognize us." (Murphy would go on to receive a supporting actor Oscar nomination 19 years later for "Dreamgirls," but, as predicted, he has yet to win an Oscar).

Halle Berry won best actress in 2002 for "Monster's Ball," the first black woman to win in that category. While weeping onstage, she acknowledged her peers as well as the black women who had been nominated before her:

"This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women that stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox. And it's for every nameless, faceless woman of color that now has a chance because this door tonight has been opened."

Fifteen years later, Berry said "that moment really meant nothing. It meant nothing. I thought it meant something, but I think it meant nothing." No black woman has won best actress since.

Critics have often pointed out that when black actors do get nominated, it's usually for stereotypical roles such as servants and slaves.

When Kim Basinger introduced a best picture nominee in 1990, she first highlighted a glaring omission: "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's scorching drama about racism and police brutality. "We've got five great films here, and they're great, for one reason: because they tell the truth. But there is one film that's missing from this list, that deserves to be on it because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all, and that's ‘Do the Right Thing.'"

"Driving Miss Daisy" won best picture that year. In it, Morgan Freeman played a black chauffeur to a wealthy, white, elderly woman; he'd later call the role "a mistake," leading him to be typecast in "wise, old, dignified, black man" roles. (Lee wouldn't be nominated for best picture until 2019, when his "BlacKkKlansman" lost to "Green Book," a divisive film about a poor, uneducated white man who chauffeurs a rich, acclaimed, black musician through the segregated South. "Every time someone is driving somebody, I lose," Lee said in the press room of the awards show.)

The conversation really kicked into high gear starting in 2015 when April Reign's #OscarsSoWhite tweet went viral. Mainstream media increasingly covered the glaring lack of diversity among nominees, drawing particular attention to the racial and ethnic makeup of the academy's voting body.

In 2016, only one nominee in the major acting and directing categories was not white. In the wake of the controversy, the academy announced major changes to its membership. Since then, the share of voting members who are people of color has doubled -- to 16 percent.

Chris Rock tackled the #OscarsSoWhite controversy head-on when he hosted the 2016 ceremony. He also told a joke based on stereotypes of Asian kids being good at math; the academy later apologized for anything "offensive" on the telecast.

But later during the broadcast, comedian Kevin Hart took to the stage to introduce a musical performance and said, "I want to take a moment to applaud all of my actors and actresses of color that didn't get nominated tonight."

"Tonight should not determine the hard work and effort you put into your craft. At the end of the day, we love what we do and we're breaking major ground doing it," he said. "These problems of today eventually will become problems of the old. Let's not let this negative issue of diversity beat us. Let's continue to do what we do best, and work hard."

Four years later, and those remarks are still relevant. Awkwafina won the Golden Globe for lead actress in a comedy for "The Farewell," but the Lulu Wang film about a family returning to China to say goodbye to their beloved matriarch was shut out by the Oscars. "Parasite," the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, received six Oscar nominations but not a single acting nod (a troubling trend regarding movies with predominantly Asian casts). Lupita Nyong'o, who won a supporting actress Oscar for "12 Years a Slave" in 2014, was overlooked for her work in Jordan Peele's "Us," as was Jennifer Lopez for her much-acclaimed turn in "Hustlers."

That's plenty to inspire any presenter who wants to continue the long tradition of calling out the Oscars -- at the Oscars.

Local film industry sets record

Texto completo: Report says projects generated $266M in economic impact for the region in 2019
From Isle of Hope and Daffin Park to River Street, film and television sets were a familiar sight around Savannah and Chatham County in 2019.
According to the recently released Savannah Regional Film commission annual report, 129 professional projects, including eight feature films, 18 television projects and 12 commercials, filmed across the area generated a record-breaking $125.6 million in direct spend and $266.3 million in economic impact for the region.
"I think (2019) was great," said Savannah Economic Development Authority President CEO Trip Tollison.
"If you look at where we started or at least where we were when the film office became a part of SEDA and where we are today, it's been a great steady growth projection."
Compared to 2018, the
total number of professional projects declined by 28, but direct spend increased by $5.5 million and economic impact increased by $11.7 million.
Beth Nelson, executive director of the Savannah Regional Film Commission, said although the number of projects may have declined, the quality has increased in recent years.
"The caliber of the projects we gotten have really gone up," Nelson said citing several projects that have recently received recognition including "Ford v Ferrari," which was recently nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture; "The Peanut Butter Falcon," took home several awards in 2019 including a South by Southwest Audience Award, and Patricia Arquette recently won both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe for her role in "The Act."
Tollison agrees.
"When you have that kind of critical acclaim from all the peers and others out there and Savannah is the backdrop, it only adds more viewers and more attention, which is what we want," he said.
Nelson said television projects are also continuing to play an important role in the local industry. The Netflix series "Ozark" came to town for a few days in June. More notable were Amazon Studios' "The Underground Railroad" and NBC's "Council of Dads," which is set to premier on March 10.
"While it counts as just one project, it's a months long shoot and it has hopefully the potential of coming back for another season," Nelson said of "Council of Dads," which filmed 10 episodes around the area, including Tybee Island, Daffin Park and Isle of Hope.
When the show premiers on March 10, its Savannah connection will run deeper than just the shooting location. The show is based on the New York Times Best Seller "The Council of Dads: My Daughters, My Illness, and the Men Who Could Be Me" by Savannah native Bruce Feiler.
"The other thing that's exciting is that Savannah will play as Savannah and it's on network TV, so everyone across the country will see Savannah as Savannah, so it's giving us a lot of exposure that way, too."
Incentives remain strong
Another driving force behind the local industry is the Savannah Entertainment Production Incentives, which offers cash rebates and relocation expenses reimbursement for qualified productions in the Hostess City.
The incentives, which are paid following verification by SEDA, were created in 2016 and through 2018 have paid out $3,129,899.56 and includes those people who applied and were accepted into the relocation program. The total for 2019 is not yet available.
In 2018 the SEDA Board of Directors approved extending the incentives through 2021 along with a few minor revisions, and Tollison said the changes have been positive.
The qualify for the incentives feature film or television pilot projects must have a budget of at least $2 million and half of the shooting days must be within 60 miles of Savannah's City Hall. A bonus of $25,000 is also available if half of the project crew listed on the final distribution list lives within 60 miles of City Hall and they are a Georgia resident.
The incentives for television- or internet-produced entertainment requirement of a minimum budget of $5 million.
"To have our Board reauthorize the program with some tweaks to really encourage more television or series or episodic productions is great. We think it compliments the state incentive very well and I think we're going to have a lot of eyes and ears on Atlanta for this legislative session as they review the current tax credit the state offers, the administration of the credit, and what that future landscape looks like," Tollison said.
The statewide film incentive has come under scrutiny after a recently released report by the state Department of Audits and Accounts found that the Georgia Department of Economic Development (DED) has used an inflated multiplier to calculate economic activity related to the credit.
According to the report, production companies spent $2.2 billion in 2016 to earn tax credits of $667 million. The Department of Economic Development has disputed the report's findings.
"Let's be honest, people and productions aren't going to look at Savannah without that state credit and that state credit is altered or tweaked -- especially if its altered or tweaked for the worse -- then that really does not bode well for Savannah or any where else in the state because that's where the incentive starts," Tollison said.
Tollison stresses that the local incentives are paid only after the work is completed and are heavily monitored and audited.
"We do our homework and we make sure everything is vetted," he said.
Looking ahead to the remainder of 2020 a few key issues that SEDA and the film commission will keep their focus on along with the state film credit include advocating for a sound stage, which Tollison said is crucial for continued success and he also hope's traveling between the two coasts gets a little easier.
"We're also still hopeful one day we can get a direct flight from L.A. to Savannah, that's obviously a market driven decision, but that would be, I think, very helpful," he said.
"And of course, making sure we keep the talent here and we add more crew to the area so that we can make sure we have the labor in place so that when the productions come we're not scurrying and trying to find help."
Nelson said she's hopeful that "Council of Dads" will also make a return to Savannah in 2020.
"Hopefully that will come back for season two. That's something we're really hoping for," she said.

Texto completo: COOINDA, Australia - At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match.
In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year - literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.
Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country's cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40%.
These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana.
"Fire is our main tool," Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. "It's part of protecting the land."
The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe.
"The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having indigenous people look after their lands," said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. "Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science."
In some ways, the aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.
But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.
Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country's thinly populated north, where aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents' concerns about the health effects of smoke.
The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces and the distinctive seasons - a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains - make burning more predictable.
Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country.
"We most certainly should learn to burn aboriginal-style," said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. "Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what aboriginal people could do."
Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals.
The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry.
"We don't have a fear of fire," said Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. "We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have."
This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas.
NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of pingpong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.
Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is long-standing: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of aboriginal methods.
The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and '90s when aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government.
Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings.
"The land was out of control," said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions.
The aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions.
According to calculations by Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57% fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started.
Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 aboriginal rangers, part time and full time.
"We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices," Yibarbuk said. "There's a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference."

With rally on Monday, Va. faces reckoning on gun laws Technology will put unified and angry people in Richmond on Monday, but, ultimately, we must reach common ground

Texto completo: Guns save lives and vaccines don't. So say some of our fellow Americans and they mean to prevail on those points.
Back in 1984, when I was writing editorials for the Daily Press, around 350 people packed Hampton City Hall, sporting stickers and holding signs that said, "Crab Smells Good."
That seemed counterintuitive, too. I had been past Hunt Crab Meal Co., the issue at hand that night. I could smell for myself.
But people tend to believe what they want to believe and, nowadays, you need only reach for your cellphone to find - and summon - like-minded company.
The vaccine issue got play last week in The New York Times, after vaccine opponents bested the leadership of the New Jersey Legislature on a measure to bar nearly all student exemptions for required vaccines.
"Technology is a huge piece of it," Sue Collins, a founder of the New Jersey Coalition for Vaccine Choice, told the Times. "Everybody has access to everybody, and they're holding it in their hands all day long."
Everybody has access to everybody. The methodologies of democracy have dramatically changed.
Even so, it's difficult to juxtapose the current furor over guns at Virginia's State Capitol - scheduled to turn into who-knows-what on Monday - with years past.
When I worked in the governor's office more than 30 years ago, the subject of guns hardly arose. No one spoke about it in excited, anxious terms. No one directly challenged the Second Amendment. And no one showed up outside the Capitol, hurtling threats.
The one controversy, as I recall, centered on legislation requiring hunters to wear blaze orange. In Virginia's gentle woods and fields, mayhem existed. Of the 77 hunting accidents in Virginia during the 1985-86 season, eight involved fatalities.
Worse even, these were fathers killing sons and brothers killing brothers.
There was some opposition to the blaze orange legislation, but it was specific. Some birds could see colors; some could not. That's what they said.
Those concerns were answered, the legislation eventually passed and, thank you, fewer hunters died from being mistaken for game.
But guns, per se? Intervene on those?
Well, the rough mindset on that topic got established - reaffirmed, really - in April 1969 during a memorable floor debate on constitutional revision in the State Senate.
State Sen. George F. Barnes of Tazewell got to the floor, eyebrows furrowed, and informed his colleagues that the language of the Second Amendment was not, in fact, echoed by similar language in the Virginia Constitution.
We should correct that, Barnes said, and Sen. M.M. Long of Wise County concurred.
Hampton Sen. Hunter Andrews responded, as only he could, "Mr. President, this is a true love-in of the Hatfields and McCoys; the great men of the mountains, Senator Barnes and Senator Long, are co-patriots on this amendment."
Andrews urged adoption of the amendment - and that got Norfolk Sen. Henry Howell on his feet.
"Remember," said Howell, "we got rid of King George, we won the war (the Revolution), we are one nation, a civilized society, with a great state National Guard, and we certainly do not need to monkey around with the militia."
A vote was taken on the proposed amendment - to duplicate in the Virginia Constitution the language and intent of the Second Amendment - and the tally was 31 Yeas and 1 Nay. The one "Nay" vote being Howell's.
As things go, you can take that as conclusive affirmation of Virginia's thinking - 50 years ago - for what the Second Amendment represents.
Have things changed that much since then?
Even with the measures now before the General Assembly - one handgun a month, universal background checks and local authority over guns in public facilities all passed the state Senate on Thursday - I wonder if the overall public attitude on guns and the Second Amendment has shifted.
What you do see is an attempt to institute some firebreaks that may - just may - prevent an armed maniac from committing mass murder.
As we know around here, this is no abstraction. The hope of stopping new tragedies is deeply felt. There is hope, too, for accommodation.
"Every virtue, and every prudent act is founded on compromise and barter," Edmund Burke said in 1775. "We give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and we choose rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants."
Technology will put unified and angry people in Richmond on Monday. But it will not change the reality that we must live with ourselves and reach, if we can, a common understanding.
After writing editorials for The Daily Press and The Virginian-Pilot in the 1980s, Gordon C. Morse wrote speeches for Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, then spent nearly three decades working on behalf of corporate and philanthropic organizations, including PepsiCo, CSX, Tribune Co. and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and Dominion Energy.

Oscar's 'Dark secret'; SAG nominations shine new race shame on Academy

Texto completo: With the Oscars slammed for its lack of diversity again this year, Sunday night's SAG Awards is ready for its close-up.
The Screen Actors Guild ceremony has another chance to upstage Hollywood's biggest night the same way it did in 2016, when all 20 Oscar acting nominations went to white people for a second year in a row, spawning the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag.
Over at SAG's smaller but still-televised show, Idris Elba won a 2016 trophy for his powerhouse performance in "Beasts of No Nation," and "Straight Outta Compton" got a nomination for its ensemble cast.
This time around, 19 of the 20 best acting Oscar nominations handed out Monday went to white people - the sole exception being Cynthia Erivo for "Harriet."
SAG, meanwhile, nominated Erivo alongside Lupita Nyong'o in its five-person Best Actress category this year and gave Best Supporting Actor and Actress nods to Jamie Foxx for "Just Mercy" and Jennifer Lopez in "Hustlers." The cast of the South Korean thriller "Parasite" also won a nomination for Best Ensemble.
"The SAG Awards will be on national TV Sunday, shaming the Oscars just weeks before their telecast," Tom O'Neil, editor of the movie awards website Gold Derby, told the Daily News.
"Academy members are Hollywood's pampered elite, and they're outrageously indifferent to people on the margins. This is the deep, dark secret that gets exposed once a year when Oscar ballots are published," he said.
O'Neil said much of the ongoing #OscarsSoWhite blame rests on an industry "that's not making enough prestige, awards-friendly movies that include non-white actors." But when great work is out there, SAG seems to do a better job of noticing, he explained.
"I think it's more gender-balanced and culturally diverse than the Academy as a whole," he said.
Looking at the mechanics, the Academy nominates actors through its Actors Branch, which reportedly stood at around 1,100 members in 2016 and has since invited around 400 more to join in a dramatic push to improve diversity.
The branch historically has been overwhelmingly white, with analyses published by the Los Angeles Times and New York Times in 2012 and 2016 pegging the number at about 88%.
As of last year, the Academy said 32% of its total membership was female, up from 25% in 2015, and that 16% of members were people of color, up from 8% in 2015.
SAG, meanwhile, nominates actors for motion picture awards through a 2,500-member panel randomly selected each year. The position is a temporary honor, so panelists are expected to do their due diligence and really watch a broad spectrum of films, O'Neil said.
"[SAG] is proud that our membership continues to recognize unique and diverse performances that more aptly reflect the world around us," the union said in statement to The News, adding that about a quarter of its overall membership lives in the New York metropolitan area.
One Hollywood veteran floated a theory on Twitter as to why the Academy still seems to vote the way it does, despite attempts to add more diversity.
"Call me crazy but I believe that white men, feeling threatened by recent pushes to hire more women & POC, are not voting for films made by those people because that would validate those films & create a shift in the market place," Glen Mazzara, who worked as a showrunner on "The Walking Dead" and created the A&E series "Damien," wrote in a post that went viral.
Speaking to The News, Mazzara said there's no way to prove Academy members are casting "protest votes" to protect their white establishment, but considering the persistent problem, "you could extrapolate my conspiracy theory."
"I don't see this same issue taking place in the Writers Guild or in SAG. I just don't," he said.
"It seems like the SAG membership did a good job of considering a lot of different performances from a lot of different actors, and you know, I commend them for putting in the work, watching the performances and being as inclusive as possible because they're all worthy of those nominations," he said.

It's 'love at first sight'

Texto completo: The white living room in Olusanya Ojikutu's home, with its soaring cathedral ceiling, is a temple to his traditional and contemporary African art. Sculptures bookend the sofa, paintings and prints decorate the walls, and the overall atmosphere is one of beauty, historic grandeur and repose.
Most of Ojikutu's sculptures are at least a century old, created for performances or rituals. "They served as intermediaries between the local people and their ancestors' spirits to make their lives better and protect them from evil forces in this world and beyond," he said.
Among the dozens of sculptures are a metal Kota reliquary guardian figure from Gabon, a wood Bamana Chi Wara headdress from Mali and a wood-fiber Bwa plank mask from Burkina Faso.
"African art has long been seen as a monolith, but it really has many different origins," said Ojikutu, who is also an artist. "It should be recognized as more nuanced and coming from the many countries on the continent. I try to show that expanse of art forms and visual cultures in my collection."
Ojikutu, 50, of Nigeria, immigrated to the United States in the mid-1990s. He and his wife, Yinka, both work in technology and live with their two teenage sons in a Washington suburb.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.
Q: Why is it important to have connections to the art you collect?
The connection I feel toward any piece I buy, own or display is almost always love at first sight. Typically it's a numinous experience; the work speaks to me. I feel this instant visual attraction followed by an unconscious burst of inspiration.
Ile-Ife (Nigeria), where I went to university, is considered the ancestral home of the Yoruba and the legendary birthplace of the gods and humankind, so I have a natural connection to Yoruba history, art and culture because it's my personal history.
I also feel a connection when I buy artists I know. Like Victor Ehikhamenor, who happens to be my friend. I bought "No Man Is an Island" (2018). If you look closely, you see small black figures and faces embedded in the large silhouette. The paradigm he presents viewers is, "There are people within you and behind you and in front of you." It's all about connections.
Q: The timespan between early African art and contemporary art is wide. Do artists today appreciate traditional African art?
Certainly I believe a handful do care about, study and are somewhat influenced by African art, particularly masks. And I feel I'm following in the footsteps of artists like Gauguin, Picasso, Modigliani, Klee, Matisse and, more recently, Bacon and Basquiat, who were emotionally connected to and influenced by traditional African art.
Q: Was there a trigger moment to your collecting?
I think there were two.
A long time ago, an artist friend, Dapo Ojoade, wanted me to look at a colorfully painted flat wood sculpture he made. So I went to his house and said, "I love it. I want it." That was the first catalyst.
Then in 2016, I attended the auction of the art estate of Merton D. Simpson. He was the most prominent African American dealer of African art and he was a painter himself. I thought, "I want to do what he has done."
This yellow painting is redolent of El Anatsui.
It is by El Anatsui, painted in the 1980s. The adinkra motifs are considered a precursor to his majestic tapestries.
The crown on this caryatid resembles the African American museum on the National Mall.
The crown's shape was the inspiration for David Adjaye's design of the museum.
I have a profound connection to the museum because I participated in the Middle Passage exhibit. The exhibitors wanted a mix of authentic voices to reenact the anguish and suffering of slaves crossing the Atlantic. I contributed the Yoruba voice.
Q: How do you share your collection?
Yinka and I organize a yearly salon in a Gertrude Stein kind of way in the lower level of our house. That's where our photo collection is -- pictures by Andrew Dosunmu, Zak Ove, George Osodi, Barthelemy Toguo, J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere -- many of my paintings and Nok terra cotta, a fragile fired-clay sculpture from sometime between 500 B.C. to 200 A.D.
We invite people over to talk about art. We make sure you feel comfortable and that when you leave you see African art as beautiful and as conversation pieces that inspire thoughtful concentration to be fully appreciated.

Texto completo: At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match.
In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year -- literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.
Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country's cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40%.
These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana.
"Fire is our main tool," Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. "It's part of protecting the land."
The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe.
"The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having indigenous people look after their lands," said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. "Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science."
In some ways, the aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.
But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.
Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country's thinly populated north, where aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents' concerns about the health effects of smoke.
The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces and the distinctive seasons -- a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains -- make burning more predictable.
Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country.
"We most certainly should learn to burn aboriginal-style," said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. "Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what aboriginal people could do."
Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals.
The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry.
"We don't have a fear of fire," said Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. "We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have."
This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas.
NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of pingpong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.
Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is long-standing: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of aboriginal methods.
The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and '90s when aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government.
Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings.
"The land was out of control," said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions.
The aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions.
According to calculations by Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57% fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started.
Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 aboriginal rangers, part time and full time.
"We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices," Yibarbuk said. "There's a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference."

Texto completo: The auto industry has been on a roll for a decade, and its resurgence shows few signs of coming to a halt -- at least for now.
Strong employment, low interest rates and robust consumer confidence combined last year to extend a record run of auto sales.
Americans are also continuing to buy ever bigger cars, at prices escalating faster than the overall inflation rate. And they are taking on more debt to do so.
Nationwide, automakers sold 17.1 million new cars and light trucks in 2019. It was the fifth straight year of sales exceeding 17 million, a distinction never achieved before. There were 17.3 million vehicles sold in 2018.
"We are past the peak," said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm with a large automotive practice. "But we are better off than we thought we would be going into 2019," he added, largely because of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Low fuel prices have also helped. The average retail price of regular gasoline is $2.57 and has not been above $3 in more than five years, according to the Energy Information Administration.
That helps explain why consumers continued gravitating toward pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and other roomy models, offsetting a steep fall in sales of sedans and compacts. Nearly two out of every three new models purchased last year were classified as light trucks, which includes minivans and even some small, SUV-shaped cars.
At the same time, the average new vehicle sold for $37,183, according to Edmunds. That represents an increase of 30% since 2009, a period in which overall consumer prices rose 20%. Much of the rise stems from increasing sales of trucks and larger vehicles, which sell for higher prices than cars. Many new cars also include elaborate technology like large touch screens, radar and other advanced safety systems.
The shift to trucks has powered General Motors and Fiat Chrysler in barely a decade from bankruptcy to near-record financial results. Ford's profit has been less stellar as it pushes to reorganize. Ford's U.S. sales fell 3% in 2019, as strong sales of trucks weren't quite enough to overcome declines in Ford's SUV and sedan sales.
Rivals that have traditionally been stronger in compacts and sedans -- like Toyota and Honda -- have also had bottom-line difficulties in North America, although they continue to make money.
Fiat Chrysler cashed in last year on the demand for pickups, with sales of its Ram jumping 18% to more than 633,000. That made it the nation's second bestselling vehicle after the Ford F-series pickup, with 896,526 trucks sold. Ram surpassed the former No. 2 bestseller Chevy Silverado. GM's U.S. sales were down 2.3% from 2018. Fiat Chrysler's sales were off 1%.
Another winner was Tesla. Though electric cars made up less than 3% of overall car sales, Tesla dominated the category, and reported that its worldwide deliveries were up 50% for the year. It did not break out sales in the United States.
Among the few companies to suffer significant declines were Mazda and Nissan, both of which have been slow to expand the range of their SUVs. Mazda's 2019 sales in the United States fell 7%, and Nissan's were down 10%.
Auto executives remain confident about the industry outlook, yet mindful that a slump will come at some point.
"I feel positive about the market in 2020," said Mike Manley, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler. "It's very difficult to tell exactly because it's an election year and you never know what's going to happen."
Most analysts see auto sales slipping only slightly in 2020, to a range of roughly 16.5 million to 16.9 million vehicles. "With the overall strength in the economy, with full employment, you've got consumer confidence at an all-time high," said Jack Hollis, group vice president and general manager of Toyota in North America.
In addition, the three big American automakers bought four years of labor peace in the fall with new union contracts, though at the cost of a 40-day strike against General Motors.
Nevertheless, the industry still faces some risks. The Trump administration's trade war with China remains unresolved. And the rising tensions between the United States and Iran are a reminder of the potential volatility of oil prices.
One worry is whether the steady rise in prices is sustainable, along with the increasing debt that owners have taken on to buy those more expensive cars.
More than one-third of Americans now have auto loans, up from 20% in 1999, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The share of consumer debt going to auto loans climbed to 9.4% in the third quarter of 2019, compared with 6% in the same period 10 years ago.
Many consumers are dealing with the higher prices by borrowing over longer terms. Auto loans approved in December had an average term of 69 months, compared with 62 months a decade earlier, Edmunds found.
That has helped keep monthly car payments from climbing as fast as sales prices. Still, those payments for loans generated in December averaged $577, up from $499 in 2014.
For Fiat Chrysler, consumer concerns about affordability have paid off. Last year, it introduced a brawnier Ram pickup available with a large touch screen and other advanced technologies. But Fiat Chrysler has continued making a more basic version, which can sell for $6,000 to $8,000 less than competing models.
Cost is pushing some buyers away from new cars.
Last August, when Pete Krupsky went to look to replace his high-mileage Honda Civic, he headed straight to his dealer's used-car lot. "I didn't want a new car because I can't afford the $25,000 or whatever the price is," said Krupsky, of Rosewood, Michigan.
He found a 2017 Honda Accord with 19,000 on its odometer -- for $18,000.

Texto completo: U. of I. chief gets a whopping raise
It is shocking that University of Illinois President Timothy Killeen is slated to earn $835,000 a year merely for doing his job well, while graduate and teaching assistants at the University of Illinois at Chicago needed to strike for three weeks to slightly improve their lot. Graduate students at UIC make a minimum salary of $18,000 and pay $2,000 in university fees. Their new contract reduced fees, increased contributions to health care plans and family coverage, and gave them a $2,550 pay increase but over three years.
The UIC workers were seeking to boost minimum salaries by 7.4% in the first year of the new contract, 7.2% in the second year and 8.2% in the third year. UIC offered a 4.1% jump in year one, then 4.1% and 3.75% increases in subsequent years.
UIC faculty members avoided a strike when they negotiated a contract that contains a 4% total raise pool per year as well as new policy protections.
How is it possible that Illinois can find the money to boost Killeen's salary by 40% but is unable to improve working conditions for hardworking faculty members, adjunct professors, graduate students, and clerical and technical personnel until they strike, and even then, is able to raise their salaries by paltry amounts?

Ban foam containers at restaurants
Chicago's restaurant and business community should support the ban on Styrofoam containers proposed by Ald. Scott Waguespack.
As a Chicago restaurant owner in Chicago for over 30 years and one who, with Ina Pinkney in 2008, founded the Green Chicago Restaurant Coalition, all six of my restaurants have been free of Styrofoam and polystyrene (No. 6 plastic) for over a dozen years. Neither profitability nor our customer base was affected when we made the switch.
Chicago is playing catch-up with the rest of the world on this issue. In addition to the European Union, many major U.S. cities, including New York City; San Diego, California; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Seattle; Washington; and Portland, Oregon, have some form of ban on the use of Styrofoam. Next year, the entire state of Maine will ban Styrofoam.
While the Waguespack ordinance is still in its early form and should be modified to make it even more practical and environmentally friendly, the Illinois Restaurant Association, the Illinois Retail Merchants Association and the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce should all be early and strong supporters of a Styrofoam ban. With sustainability being so much a part of Chicago's vibrant restaurant scene, there can be little doubt that our great chefs and restaurateurs will be solidly behind such action.
-- Dan Rosenthal, president, Sopraffina Marketcaffes, Trattoria No. 10, Chicago

Hope in fight against climate change
I largely agree with New York Times columnist Paul Krugman ("Australia shows us the road to climate hell," Jan. 10) but believe two things offer hope.
Climate change is my foremost concern. I closely follow the news and continually learn new things, from the latest grim statistics and prognostications to both encouraging and discouraging developments worldwide. But I'm in the minority. Most people "believe" in human-caused climate change but are preoccupied with other problems and don't realize that climate action can't wait. They know Australia is burning and ache for the baby koalas. They cluck sympathetically without comprehending the immediacy of the crisis.
Unlike Krugman, I believe that many people are open-minded but insufficiently informed. They must be reached and motivated to both take and demand climate action. Don't put too much blame on politicians. They tend to respond to the expressed concerns of their constituents, which are usually health care and jobs, not climate change.
I also disagree with Krugman on the need for and usefulness of a carbon tax. Again, many people are insufficiently informed about the wide-ranging benefits of a transparent, well-designed, revenue-neutral tax. They anticipate and fear sacrifice. Some are irrevocably opposed for ideological reasons or perceived self-interest and won't be swayed, but I think they are outnumbered. A growing number of economists believe a strong tax that returns most of the revenue to taxpayers is a necessary part of any climate strategy. It would sharply discourage the use of fossil fuels without regulations and government meddling.
But not all carbon taxes are created equal, and success or failure is in the details. Several models have been thoroughly analyzed and predicted to benefit almost everyone except those who gain from destroying the environment, climate, and future. The people who are insufficiently informed about such a tax must be reached.
It should be possible to awaken the somnolent. There seems to be progress. Whether we can still avert climate disaster is moot, but disaster a given unless we try.

Texto completo: The Trump administration moved Friday to roll back school nutrition standards championed by former first lady Michelle Obama, an effort long sought by food manufacturers and some school districts that have chafed at the cost of Obama's prescriptions for fresh fruit and vegetables.
The proposed rule by the Agriculture Department, coming on Michelle Obama's birthday, would give schools more latitude to decide how much fruit to offer during breakfast and which types of vegetables to provide. It would also broaden what counts as a snack.
The rule was applauded by food companies but condemned by nutritionists who predicted starchy foods like potatoes would replace green vegetables and fattening food like hamburgers would become staples of school "snacks."
"Schools and school districts continue to tell us that there is still too much food waste and that more common-sense flexibility is needed to provide students nutritious and appetizing meals," Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement. "We listened and now we're getting to work."
The Agriculture Department said the changes reflected requests made over the past two years by those who serve meals to children and teenagers throughout the school year. The department plans to release a regulatory analysis and open the public comment period on Jan. 21.
The proposal is the department's second attempt to roll back nutrition standards promoted by Obama through the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act, which required schools to serve children fruits and vegetables every day and to offer more whole-grain foods and fat-free or low-fat milk. It also required school meal providers to limit calories and reduce saturated fat, trans fat and sodium.
The department finalized a rule in December 2018 that gave school meal providers permission to serve flavored low-fat milk in the national school lunch program and school breakfast program. That rule stipulated that only half the weekly grains must be whole grain, and it gave providers more time to reduce sodium in meals.
Friday's proposal goes further. It allows schools to adjust fruit servings during breakfast, to reduce waste, it said, and to make room for "meats and meat alternates." Under current regulation, providers must provide one cup of fruit during breakfast for students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
The new rule would also relax current vegetable requirements, which say providers must offer a variety of vegetables, like leafy greens and starchy foods. A department official said the goal was to give more flexibility, not change the amount of vegetables offered.
The proposal would also allow schools to offer lunch entrees for a la carte purchase, in order to reduce waste.
Child nutritionists said the proposed rule could lead to school meal providers turning away from healthy foods, instead of coming up with ways to make the food more appealing. More flexibility on the types of vegetables offered could lead to meals dominated by starchy foods, like potatoes, which are cheaper than green vegetables.
The National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity said allowing lunch entrees for a la carte purchase would create a "giant junk food loophole." It could also lead to children frequently turning to meals that are meant to be eaten once a week, like hamburgers.
But conservatives applauded.
"The school breakfast and lunch programs have been riddled with waste for a long time, plate waste, being one, and that turns into financial waste," said Jonathan Butcher, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices -- fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided -- are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.
Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day -- at least once -- on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.
Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now -- they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.
Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A: Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.
Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A: The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.
Q: What else do you look for?
A: Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.
Q: What do you think of sustainable fashion?
A: I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I'm honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?
Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop -- but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

Texto completo: The sergeant in charge of one of the busiest Army recruiting centers in Colorado, Sgt. 1st Class Dustin Comes, joined the Army, in part, because his father served. Now two of his four children say they want to serve too. And he will not be surprised if the other two make the same decision once they are a little older.
"Hey, if that's what your calling is, I encourage it, absolutely," said Comes, who wore a dagger-shaped patch on his camouflage uniform, signifying that he had been in combat.
Enlisting, he said, enabled him to build a good life where, despite yearlong deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, he felt proud of his work, got generous benefits, never worried about being laid off and earned enough that his wife could stay home to raise their children.
"Show me a better deal for the common person," he said.
Soldiers like him are increasingly making the U.S. military a family business. The men and women who sign up overwhelmingly come from counties in the South and a scattering of communities at the gates of military bases like Colorado Springs, which sits next to Fort Carson and several Air Force installations, and where the tradition of military service is ingrained.
More and more, new recruits are the children of old recruits. In 2019, 79% of Army recruits reported having a family member who served. For nearly 30%, it was a parent -- a striking point in a nation where less than 1% of the population serves in the military.
For years, military leaders have been sounding the alarm over the growing gulf between communities that serve and those that do not, warning that relying on a small number of counties that reliably produce soldiers is unsustainable, particularly now amid escalating tensions with Iran.
"A widening military-civilian divide increasingly impacts our ability to effectively recruit and sustain the force," Anthony Kurta, acting undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, told the National Commission on Military, National and Public Service last year.
"This disconnect is characterized by misperceptions, a lack of knowledge and an inability to identify with those who serve. It threatens our ability to recruit the number of quality youth with the needed skill sets to maintain our advantage."
To be sure, the idea of joining the military has lost much of its luster in nearly two decades of war. The patriotic rush to enlist after the terrorist attacks of 2001 has faded. For a generation, enlisting has produced reliable hardship for troops and families but nothing that resembles victory. But the military families who have borne nearly all of the burden -- and are the most clear-eyed about the risks of war -- are still the Americans who are most likely to encourage their sons and daughters to join.
With the goal of recruiting about 68,000 soldiers in 2020, the Army is trying to broaden its appeal beyond traditional recruitment pools. New marketing plays up future careers in medicine and tech, as well as generous tuition benefits for a generation crushed by student debt. They often note that most Army jobs are not in combat fields.
But for now, rates of military service remain far from equal in the United States, and the gap may continue to widen because a driving decision to enlist is whether a young person knows anyone who served in the military. In communities where veterans are plentiful, teachers, coaches, mothers, uncles and other mentors often steer youths toward military service. In communities where veterans are scarce, influential adults are more wary.
That has created a broad gap, easily seen on a map. The South, where the culture of military service runs deep and military installations are plentiful, produces 20% more recruits than would be expected, based on its youth population. Northeast states, which have few military bases and a lower percentage of veterans, produce 20% fewer.
The main predictors are not based on class or race. Army data show service spread mostly evenly through middle-class and "downscale" groups. Youth unemployment turns out not to be the prime factor. And the racial makeup of the force is more or less in line with that of young Americans as a whole, although African Americans are slightly more likely to serve. Instead, the best predictor is a person's familiarity with the military.
"Those who understand military life are more likely to consider it as a career option than those who do not," said Kelli Bland, a spokeswoman for the Army's Recruiting Command.
That distinction has created glaring disparities across the country. In 2019, Fayetteville, North Carolina, which is home to Fort Bragg, provided more than twice as many military enlistment contracts as Manhattan, even though that New York City borough has eight times as many people.
This was not always the case. Military service was once spread fairly evenly -- at least geographically -- throughout the nation because of the draft. But after the draft ended in 1973, enlistments shifted steadily south of the Mason-Dixon Line. The military's decision to close many bases in Northern states where long winters limited training only hastened the trend.
Today, students growing up in military communities are constantly exposed to the people who serve. Moms pick up their sons from day care in flight suits. Dads attend the fourth-grade holiday party in camouflage. High schools often have Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps programs in which students wear uniforms to class once a week and can earn credit for learning about science, leadership and fitness through a military framework.
Many schools encourage students to take the military's aptitude exam, the ASVAB, in the way students nationwide are pushed to take the SAT.
That exposure during school is one of the strongest predictors of enlistment rates, according to a 2018 report by the Institute for Defense Analyses.
In Los Angeles, by contrast, the Army has struggled to even gain access to high schools. By law, schools have to allow recruiters on campus once a semester, but administrators tightly control when and how recruiters can interact with students.
Predictably, enlistment rates are low.
In 2019 the Army made a push to increase recruiting efforts in 22 liberal-leaning cities like Los Angeles. As part of that, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy visited Los Angeles Unified School District in December to push for greater access.
"He was doing a sort of listening tour," said Patricia Heideman, who is in charge of high school instruction for the school district and said there was a perception the military preys on disadvantaged students. "I told him from the educator perspective, we sometimes feel they are targeting our black and brown students and students of poverty," she said.

Jodi Benson: Expect tunes from under the sea to Broadway

Texto completo: “That song,” Jodi Benson said the other day over the phone from her home in North Georgia, “that song gave me the keys to the kingdom.”
No, not “Part of Your World,” the “I Want” number that launches the viewer’s love affair with Disney’s “Little Mermaid.” Benson’s reference is to “Disneyland,” her solo from “Smile,” the vehicle for her first featured role on Broadway, which brought her to the attention of the show’s lyricist, Howard Ashman, who engineered the fateful audition with Disney.
“Back then they weren’t looking the way they do now,” Benson said. “Stars and personalities and celebrities weren’t part of the equation. They just wanted to find the right voice for the character. They didn’t look at your bio, they didn’t look at your head shot. They just listened to your reel-to-reel tape.
“About a year later I got the call that it was down to me and one other actress, and I’d completely forgotten what it was for.”
It was for the role of her lifetime, Ariel, first in the line of Disney’s post-“Sleeping Beauty” heroines. “Someday My Prince Will Come”? As if! Ariel, Belle, Mulan, Anna and Elsa, Moana and the rest are not the type to sit and dream and wait.
On the Maui Pops Orchestra’s program Jan. 26 at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater, Benson sings Ashman’s lyrics from “Smile” (music by Marvin Hamlish) and “Mermaid” (music by Alan Menken), plus a generous assortment of less predictable yet choice bonbons.
Not to give away the candy store, let’s just toss out some teasers. For openers, there’s a breakout number that helped skyrocket the 21-year-old Barbra Streisand to the big time. Later on, listen for a Gershwin standard penned for the original Mrs. Anna of “The King and I,” Judy Garland’s signature tune, a Sondheim show-stopper and a whole lot more.
“I don’t pick the songs,” Benson said. “We give the producer and the maestro a long, long list, and they put together what they think their audience would like to hear. Sometimes they choose songs I haven’t done in a long, long time, even some I’ve never done before. I love when that happens. It keeps me on my toes.”
At the MACC, listen for two such novelties, one from “Guys and Dolls,” one from “A Chorus Line.” These are songs for ladies with some mileage and the bent fenders to show for it. In short, not part of what you’d picture as Ariel’s world.
Speaking of Ariel’s world, one song a twisted fan we know fantasizes about is the bossy comedy number with which the sea witch Ursula takes possession of Ariel’s voice in exchange for a pair of human legs.
“No,” Benson said, “that’s one I’ve never done. Mostly I sing all the princess songs, the hopeful songs. ‘Poor, Unfortunate Souls’! That would be a lot of fun someday.”

Classically trained ballet troupe embraces a fusion of styles

Texto completo: Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? Goodness, no! And certainly not with the chimes of the new year, even a new decade, still lingering in our ears. The Aspen Santa Fe Ballet’s appearance at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center’s Castle Theater on Thursday marks the company’s fourth visit to the Valley Isle, after an absence of five years.
Do you identify ballet with the aristocratic, pedigreed troupes of Paris, Moscow, St. Petersburg, Copenhagen, London and New York, their populous rosters stratified into stars (principals), lesser lights (soloists) and the glamorous rank and file (corps de ballet)? Do you regard those companies’ baked-in reverence for pomp and ceremony as the soul of the art form?
Then brace for a SWAT team of just 10 performers.
“We don’t hire dancers; we hire people,” ASFB’s co-founder and executive director, Jean-Philippe Malaty, said recently from Colorado. “Hopefully, they can dance and are great. We want to see what they have to say as artists. Choreographers always allow for that. We have a company aesthetic, but you will see very different personalities and sense of expression.”
New recruit or veteran of 20 years, all are equal in status, now perhaps taking the lead, now perhaps taking the lead from someone else.
If you’re envisioning ballerinas in stiff white tutus, twirling on point, that too would be off the mark. While some ballets in the company’s repertory do incorporate toe-dancing, the three on the current tour program do not. That said, the foundation upon which ballet was built, beginning with the five textbook positions, is never in question.
“All our dancers are classically trained,” Malaty continued. “They take a classical class every morning. You see the discipline in every dancer’s line and body. Our company does embrace a fusion of styles, but everything we do is rooted in classical ballet.”
To exaggerate a valid distinction, ballet is dance in quest of extension, of elevation, dance that wants to take to the air — as contrasted with modern dance, which releases energy from contraction and prizes the connection to the earth, which is why it is performed barefoot.
Now in its 24th season, ASFB is reportedly unique among ballet companies in that it is based in two cities, with schools in both. Yet in size and structure it closely resembles iconic modern-dance troupes. Yet here another distinction is in order.
Historically, modern-dance companies have mostly functioned as showcases for the choreography of founders like Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor. Malaty and Tom Mossbrucker, co-founder with Malaty of ASFB and the company’s artistic director, envisioned from the outset an ensemble that would be an instrument for an international cadre of contrasting and exciting creative talents.
“The only ballet Tom and I choreographed ourselves is our very traditional Christmas ‘Nutcracker,’ for which we bring in an extra two dozen dancers or so,” Malaty noted. “We met as dancers in the Joffrey Ballet and between us had done ‘The Nutcracker’ thousands of times. Besides, we knew our company better than anyone else. So, it only made sense.”
Occasionally, the company acquires a pre-existing ballet, but for the most part, the repertory consists of custom-made pieces.
“We’ve developed great partnerships and solid relationships,” Malaty said. “When the fit is right, we like to invite choreographers back to create new work on our dancers. Ongoing collaboration deepens the relationship and makes a finer product.”
The program for Maui mirrors this philosophy. “Where We Left Off” (2011), to music of Philip Glass, is by the New Yorker Nicolo Fonte, who has made 10 dances for the company. “Silent Ghost” (2015), with a score stitched together from many sources, is the company’s fourth piece from Alejandro Cerrudo, a native of Madrid.
The final entry, “1st Flash” (2003), one of ASFB’s eight repertory pieces by Jorma Elo of Helsinki, is set to the 40-minute Violin Concerto of Elo’s fellow Finn Jean Sibelius.
Conjuring up haunted, sometimes bleak wide-open landscapes, the score builds to a controlled tornado one early champion called “a polonaise” — the polonaise being a ballroom dance dear to the heart of Frederic Chopin — but “a polonaise for polar bears.”
Yes, or maybe grizzlies. Unlike the other pieces on the program, which both call for the company’s full complement of 10 dancers, “1st Flash” features just six, who will have their work cut out for them.

Texto completo: Running Thursday through Jan. 26, the Maui Fringe Theater Festival at the Iao Theater in Wailuku is now in its 10th year. Like exponentially larger events on the international arts circuit, it attracts self-producing stage folks eager to garner sexy quotes and hopefully a prize or two to drive future engagements. What predominates? As always, autobiographical solo shows performed by the playwrights. Cases in point: “Chemo Barbie” (a cancer survivor tells all), “He Wants to Run” (a man bonds with his neighbor’s dog), “My Name Is Mommy” (prize winner at the 2019 Hollywood Fringe Festival), plus the one-woman musical “Cave Girl” (“dark and hilarious”). For some flash on a larger scale, there’s the Maui Belly Dance Company. The uplifting “How Can I Help?” — cast of seven — is based on the writings of Paul Gorman and the recently departed spiritual guru Ram Dass. Shows run 60 minute or less; admission is $ 15. Judges have to see everything; others pay their money and take their chances. My money’s on the dog. Info: mauionstage.com or 242-6969.

Fugees: Why it's time for NJ legends to reunite

Texto completo: Ready or not, we believe the time has come for New Jersey's next great musical reunion. What the world needs now are Fugees.
Jersey fresh artists such My Chemical Romance of Belleville, The Misfits from Lodi, New Brunswick's The Gaslight Anthem and the Jonas Brothers out of Wyckoff have all made the rounds on the lucrative reunion circuit in recent years.
But the long-gone Essex County trio of South Orange native Lauryn Hill, the Haitian-born and Newark-raised Wyclef Jean and Irvington native Prakazrel "Pras" Michel were one of American music's defining acts in the mid-1990s. It's time to remind the world why.
They were far from prolific, releasing only two albums — 1994's "Blunted on Reality" and 1996's "The Score."
That sophomore album had monster singles galore — the Roberta Flack cover "Killing Me Softly With His Song," "Fu-Gee-La" and the haunting "Ready or Not" — as well as a cult favorite cover of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry."
While the bombastic "Blunted" didn't make much of a sales splash, "The Score" soared; it was released in February 1996, and by October 1997 it had moved more than 6 million units and reached the top of the Billboard 200, according to a 2016 Billboard retrospective.
Listening back to "The Score" now, it's easy to see why it shook the world.
Nearly a quarter century after its release, the album still resonates as a vividly fluid sonic statement that defies constraints of genre and time, as Brick City rhymes flow seamlessly with samples from The Flamingos and Enya to create a lush, cinematic tapestry of sound.
If anything, the group has only become more timely; their name, an abbreviation of refugees. served as "a reference to the diminished status that poor emigrants from countries such as Haiti encounter in the United States," according to a 1996 Rolling Stone profile.
Decades later, the American government's changing policies toward refugees from around the world entering the country remains a topical, contentious issue.
This was a beautiful North Jersey musical melting pot which earned a pair of 1997 Grammys — Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for "Killing Me Softly With His Song" — and also was nominated for Album of the Year (it lost to Celine Dion's "Falling Into You," co-produced by Roy Bittan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band).
Their too-brief body of work made an undeniable impact. Rolling Stone named "The Score" one of the best albums of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time, while the Asbury Park Press dubbed them the second-greatest hip-hop act to ever come out of New Jersey (behind only Naughty by Nature).
Following "The Score," each of the Fuguees found massive solo success.
The 1997 album "Wyclef Jean presents The Carnival featuring Refugee Allstars" boasted the hit "Gone Till November," and the following year Pras dominated the airwaves with the "Bulworth" soundtrack single "Ghetto Superstar (That is What You Are)."
Then there was the juggernaut of early solo-era Hill. "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" in 1998 had the hits "Doo Wop (That Thing)" and "Everything is Everything," and won five Grammy Awards, becoming the first rap album to ever win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
In the 20-plus years since the Fugees' cultural domination, Jean in particular has remained a highly in-demand producer and collaborator, working with the likes of Whitney Houston (1998's "My Love is Your Love"), Santana (1999's "Maria Maria," the basis of DJ Khaled's "Wild Thoughts"), Destiny's Child (1998's "No, No, No Pt. 2") and Shakira (2005's "Hips Don't Lie").
The next generation of New Jersey musical talent event benefited from Jean's wisdom when he visited Asbury Park in 2018 to work with the youth of the Asbury Park Music Foundation and performed at that year's Asbury Park Music and Film Festival.
But they've only been heard from sporadically as a unit during this millennium; there was a 2004 Brooklyn show filmed for the 2006 documentary "Dave Chapelle's Block Party," then in 2005 a BET Awards appearance, a European tour and a single, "Take it Easy."
As recently as 2018, Pras told New York hip-hop radio station Hot 97 FM that the group had been offered $90 million for a 15-month tour, but both Jean and Hill were non-committal.
Each member has experienced troubles and controversies in recent years. Hill served three months in a Connecticut federal prison in 2013 after failing to pay taxes while Jean's charity, Yéle, was scrutinized in a 2012 New York Times article.
Earlier this year, Pras was charged by U.S. prosecutors with making donations to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign as a proxy for Jho Low, who served as an adviser to former Malaysia prime minister Najib Razak.
Commercial hip-hop was born in New Jersey, thanks to the Sugarhill Gang's landmark 1979 recording of "Rapper's Delight" for Sylvia Robinson's Englewood-based Sugar Hill Records.
The artform's rich, shared history with New Jersey was in the spotlight when MTV brought its Video Music Awards to the Prudential Center in Newark in August 2019.
Several of the state's hip-hop luminaries shared the stage together, including Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature, Redman and Fetty Wap.
Wyclef was there, too, guitar in hand, to perform a verse and chorus of "Gone Till November" and some of "No Woman, No Cry" and then jam out as part of the grand finale on Naughty by Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray."
The celebration couldn't help but feel a little hollow; a singular commemoration of New Jersey's place in hip-hop history deserved more direct Fugees representation than a bit of a Bob Marley song that they also covered.
New Jersey's musical reunion boom in recent years has been great for representing the state's rock 'n' roll and pop history, reminding folks around the world that the Misfits were more than inspiration for a T-shirt line and proving that Gerard Way had a pretty good gig going before he created "Umbrella Academy."
Now it's time to do the same for Jersey's hip-hop legacy.
In their prime, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel created a whole that was somehow greater than the sum of its considerable parts.
The Fugees' lush, boundary-pushing universal sound would hit just as hard today as it did back in 1996, the artists and audience once again vibing on a truly global frequency.
The Fugees, and crew, arrive at New York's Radio City Music Hall in 1996 for the 13th annual MTV Video Music Awards.

Texto completo: Everyone who resolves to read more in the new year is immediately confronted with a question that is both exhilarating and daunting: What should you read first?
Between bestseller lists, celebrity book clubs and hot new releases it can be challenging to commit to your next read. Instead of getting lost in the dizzying number of options, why not trust your book-loving neighbors? We gathered data from Augusta County, Staunton and Waynesboro libraries to determine the most popular library books of the year.
The most popular book between all three library branches was the 2018 mystery 'Where the Crawdads Sing' by Delia Owens.
If you want to pick up 'Where the Crawdads Sing,' you might have to get in line. The book has constantly been on hold or checked out for almost an entire year, according to Staunton Director of Library Services Sarah Skrobis. When a copy finally became available at the beginning of January, the librarians almost didn't know what to do.
"We were amazed that we finally had an available copy," Skrobis said. "It's already back in the holds queue for someone else now, though, so it didn't stick around for long."
It isn't surprising that the book gained so much attention in the Valley. 'Where the Crawdads Sing"'was featured on New York Times bestseller lists, popular bookclub itineraries and more. The word 'crawdad' was even on Merriam-Webster's roundup of the most searched words of 2019.
Here are the top 15 titles based on consortium-wide reports of both holds and check-outs. According to Skrobis, including the number holds helps represent what books have the highest demand. The data for this list excludes manga series because the multiple installments under one title can skew statistics.
Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens
Long Road to Mercy by David Baldacci
The Reckoning by John Grisham
Past Tense: A Jack Reacher Novel by Lee Child
Becoming by Michelle Obama
Wolf Pack: A Joe Pickett Novel by C.J. Box
Redemption by David Baldacci

Dark Sacred Night by Michael Connelly
Neon Prey by John Sanford
Liar Liar by James Patterson
The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides
Look Alive Twenty-Five: A Stephanie Plum Novel by Janet Evanovich
Kingdom of the Blind by Louise Penny
The Chef by James Patterson
Based on these titles, thrillers and mystery stories are the most popular.
Although the Staunton, Augusta County and Waynesboro libraries often share patrons and resources, there are some differences between the locations.
For example, the most popular children's nonfiction titles at the Augusta County Library included 'Galaxies, Galaxies!' by Gail Gibbons and 'Space' by Martha E. H. Rustad. This pattern is likely because the library's summer reading game theme was space, Adult Services Programmer Ali McCue said.
Here's a breakdown of some popular categories at each library:
Augusta County Public Library Adults in Augusta county tend to love healthy cookbooks, major mystery and thriller authors and inspiring personal growth stories, McCue said. She also finds that young adult readers consistently choose books about teenagers who overcome adversity and make a difference in their world. Outside of novels, teens also love manga and Minecraft.

Texto completo: "You deserve a congresswoman who walks in on day one and knows how crazy Washington works."
Valerie Plame
Democratic Congressional District 3 candidate
AZTEC – Candidates for Congressional District 3 and U.S. Senate are visiting San Juan County as the date approaches for the San Juan County Republican and Democratic parties' pre-primary conventions.
The Democratic county convention will be Jan. 25 and the Republican convention will be Jan. 30.
San Juan County Democratic Party Chairwoman MP Schildmeyer said the county's pre-primary convention involves selecting delegates. These delegates will attend the state pre-primary convention on March 7 and vote for candidates. Any candidate who receives 20% of the vote will automatically be included on the primary election ballot. The Republican state pre-primary convention will also be on March 7.
Republican Senate candidate participates in forum Republican candidate Elisa Martinez, who is running for U.S. Senate, visited San Juan County this week and stopped by the San Juan County Patriot's Jan. 16 meeting in Aztec. This allowed her to become a last-minute addition to a candidate forum, replacing Congressional District 3 candidate Alexis Johnson who was unable to make the forum due to a storm.
If elected, Martinez will be the first woman to serve as New Mexico's senator. She identifies as both Native American and Latina. She is an anti-abortion advocate who founded the New Mexico Alliance for Life.
"I've been on the front lines with many of you fighting for the right to life for unborn children," she said.
Martinez also spoke out in favor of a border wall and said she supports the Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Valerie Plame meets with voters in Farmington Valerie Plame hopes to be the Democratic Party's nominee for Congressional District 3, and some of the Republican candidates have identified her as the candidate that will be hardest to defeat in the general election.
"You've got to pick the candidate who can beat that Plame woman," said Karen Bedonie, who is running for the Republican nomination, during the San Juan County Patriots meeting.
Out of all the candidates in both parties, Plame has the most name recognition. She served in the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for decades before her identity as a covert officer was leaked in 2003. Plame said a member of the President George W. Bush administration leaked her identity in retaliation for an opinion piece her husband published in the New York Times criticizing the war in Iraq.
"I love what I did," she said during a campaign visit. "I felt like it was really meaningful."
She said if her identity had not been leaked, she would still be overseas "chasing bad guys around the world."
More recently, Plame gained national attention for her action movie style campaign video, which featured her driving a sports car and has received more than a million views on YouTube.
Plame said her experience sets her apart from the rest of the candidates. She said she has more Washington, D.C. experience than her fellow candidates.
"You deserve a congresswoman who walks in on day one and knows how crazy Washington works," Plame said.
Plame said if elected she will be focused on the issues important to New Mexicans. She said the three issues she has heard people across the district talking about are employment, education and the environment.
In terms of the environment, she said she does not support a proposal to retrofit the San Juan Generating Station with carbon capture technology because it doesn't sound like a "fully-baked technology" and it still relies on coal. Instead, she said the two national labs in New Mexico should focus on developing green energy technology and the government should provide incentives for those technologies.
"New Mexico has such potential to be a leader in green energy," Plame said.
Republican CD3 candidates speak about guns during forum Three Republican candidates for Congressional District 3 emphasized their support of the Second Amendment while participating in a candidate forum during the San Juan County Patriots meeting.
Audra Brown carried her gun with her and said the 2019 New Mexico legislative session prompted her to run for office.
"This all started for me with Second Amendment advocacy," she said.
Brown said she was one of the people who traveled to Santa Fe during the 2019 legislative session to protest bills like the Extreme Risk Protection Order, also known as red flag laws. This bill ultimately failed but is on the 2020 legislative session agenda.
"I'm not a politician," Brown said. "But I don't think that's what we need right now. I think we need something stronger. We need something like our president. We need someone who will stand up, who will take the insults and smile, but not back down... Compromise is not negotiated reductions in our liberties."
Anastacia "Anise" Golden Morper said the Second Amendment protects rights like freedom of speech, freedom of religion and the right to think.
"Without our Second Amendment rights, we lose everything," she said.
She told a story about begging her father to let her going hunting with him. She said he required her to learn how to break down a weapon and reload the ammo before she could even go with him on a hunting trip. She said she learned how to do everything her father required and, at six years old, joined him on a hunting trip.
"It was hard to keep up with Daddy, because it was quail," she said. "But we had a great time. "I went hunting with my Dad just about every season after that."
She said as a single mother for 16 years she taught her children how to use firearms to defend themselves.
Bedonie's campaign website and the sign she brought to the meeting feature an image of her holding a firearm.
"That picture is not a political picture," Bedonie said. "It's a picture of an American standing for what she believes in."
She said the rifle represents her family accepting their American civility and the citizenship that Native Americans were granted in 1926 by her favorite president, Calvin Coolidge.
Bedonie also emphasized her support of fossil fuels, including coal.
"We need it," she said. "It's a gift from the holy people."
After the forum, Bedonie said if elected she will support the effort to retrofit the San Juan Generating Station with carbon capture and provide funding to the national laboratories in New Mexico to further develop the technology, as well as technology to remove uranium from water and oil from soil.
Johnson has statement read for her after storm prevents visit While Johnson was unable to make the forum, she had a statement read by one of her supporters.
"I am just one American patriot," Johnson said in her statement. "I am not a politician or a billionaire or a queen. Some may call me idealistic, young or tell me that I don't know how the process works. And some may even laugh at me for still believing in a free America, which our forefathers struggled and labored to build."

Texto completo: Who would ever believe a word uttered by Paul Skulnik, Florida's most notorious jailhouse snitch?
I doubt any of his eight ex-wives would attest to his credibility. (Nine if you count the Texas woman he scammed with a fake marriage certificate.) Marriage only provided Skulnik a means to loot their savings and max out their credit cards.
He also molested young stepdaughters from two of those faux marriages. So no, the women in his life aren't likely to vouch for his credibility.
When he wasn't stealing from his spouses, he was conning other acquaintances, including various in-laws, into underwriting his fraudulent schemes. He snookered them with fake names, fake occupations, fake degrees and bad checks. With claims that he was an undercover agent for the FBI or the CIA. That he was dying of cancer.
The Texas assistant DA who prosecuted Skulnik for sexual assault told Pamela Colloff of the New York Times and ProPublica that he was "grandiose, delusional and had narcissistic-personality disorder."
Who would believe such a fabulist?
The cops and prosecutors who put James Milton Dailey on Florida's death row. That's who.
Skulnik was a key witness in the 1987 murder trial of Dailey, charged as an accomplice in the murder of 14-year-old Shelly Boggia. The Pinellas County case lacked physical evidence but Skulnik testified that a few months before the trial, when he and Dailey were both confined in the Pinellas County Jail, he had happened to walk by the murder defendant's cell. And that Dailey, using gruesome details, told a stranger outside his cell door how he had murdered the girl.
This wasn't the first confession Skulnik supposedly procured in such fleeting circumstances. According the shocking ProPublica/Times investigation published last month, Skulnik provided investigators with confessions to 37 serious crimes between 1981 and 1987, including 18 murders, from prisoners at the Pinellas County Jail. Four of those cases led to death sentences.
Of course, fellow inmates well knew that Skulnik was an informant, looking to curry leniency in his own cases. Yet, in case after case, cops and prosecutors eagerly embraced the notion that criminal defendants had blurted incriminating details to an infamous snitch, who just happened to be in their vicinity.
Who would believe such a thing? Well, last month, a federal judge added his name to a long list of criminal justice officials untroubled by such a scenario. Or not bothered enough to intercede in the 73-year-old Dailey's conviction and death sentence.
U.S. District Judge William Jung, rejecting Dailey's latest appeal, shrugged off questions about Skulnik's credibility, though he admitted that jailhouse informant testimony "is often fraught with problems."
"Fraught with problems" is a considerable understatement. The University of Michigan Law School's National Registry of Exonerations found that 15 percent of the nation's wrongful murder convictions and 23 percent of those resulting in death sentences have been based, on part, on the testimony of jailhouse informants. On lies.
South Floridians might remember the words of the Palm Beach County Jail's so-called super-snitch, Freddy Cobia. In 2015, embarrassed prosecutors had fought to excise a recording of a Cobia conversation from the public record. He had boasted on the jailhouse phone, "I'm the only person in United States' history that could ever provide testimony that could close over 60 murder cases, you hear me?"
The Palm Beach Post reported that Cobia had extracted "confessions" from fellow inmates at least 23 times, including from three murder suspects. He had been convicted of a brutal murder himself in 2015 but cops and prosecutors kept him around the jail for years to elicit self-incriminating statements that might bolster otherwise tenuous cases. When the convicted murderer was finally brought up for sentencing last year, cops and prosecutors repaid him with recommendations of leniency. (The judge, not so impressed, gave him 40 years.)
Another notorious snitch, a murder-for-hire convict, provided clinching testimony about an overheard confession that sent Wilton Dedge to prison for 22 years for murder in 1984 before he was cleared by DNA testing. A rapist-turned-snitch testified that William Dillion told him all about a 1981 murder. Dillion spent 27 years in Florida prisons before DNA testing led to his exoneration.
Most of Florida's past snitch-based murder convictions, of course, didn't include DNA evidence that could later provide definitive evidence of guilt or innocence. You don't need to be a math genius to extrapolate that lying jailhouse informants, expecting sentence reductions in their own cases, helped send innocents to the death chamber.
James Milton Dailey could be next.

New Year's resolution: zero homelessness in Reno-Sparks

Texto completo: It's that time of year when we look at what we want to improve in our lives, so we resolve to lose weight, stop smoking or exercise more. Maybe it would be a good time as a community to decide to engage and really help our neighbors experiencing homelessness in our community — not just work on the issue, but solve it.
Homelessness is complicated: Anyone who has engaged in addressing homelessness understands that it's complicated. It's more than just housing, but without housing, the problem only gets worse. It's more than drug and alcohol addiction, but without adequate staffing and resources, the addictions go unchecked. It's more than moving people experiencing homelessness out of sight because they just find another location, which often results in homeless camps that are besieged with crime and unsanitary conditions.
With that, our region's parks and trails become less safe and, in some areas, unusable. There is no simple solution. If there were, San Francisco and many other cities would not be overwhelmed by the adverse impacts of growing homelessness. Are we going to wait until we get to that point, or can we do something now, as a community, to help those in need?
The community is ready to act: Over the past year local governments have come together to work on this issue. They established the Community Homeless Advisory Board and meet regularly to look at the challenges while working together to develop solutions. The CHAB commissioned a study by OrgCode Consulting and have already implemented some of the recommendations of the report. The former Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services campus was acquired from the state to house and rehabilitate homeless women and children and is being renovated. However, there is no funding to renovate or relocate the Record Street men's shelter. The Crossroads Program, which has over a 90% success rate, provides housing for those battling addiction and transitioning out of homelessness. The program has expanded for the women, but still has a waiting list for the men. There are also public-private ventures like the Village on Sage Street and the Eddy House expansion for our homeless youth. Still, we lack a real coordinated and funded plan, not just to help those experiencing homelessness, but to reduce or even eliminate homelessness in our community.
Zero homelessness is possible: A collaborative methodology was first pioneered in the health care sector to combat the spread of deadly infections. The only program that has proven to reduce or eliminate homelessness is a similar collaborative methodology. According to the New York Times, "nine communities in the United States have reached a rigorous standard known as "functional zero" for chronic homelessness — a standard that indicates homelessness is rare." This is one goal our community should consider as our New Year's resolution.
So how do we do this? While complicated, the solution is not impossible. There are a few things we can do to get us on the Zero Homeless List. First, demonstrate a commitment by the entire community, community leaders, care providers, businesses, citizens and the Veteran's Administration to work together to achieve a "functional zero homeless" outcome. Second, establish a system that monitors the homeless by name, in real-time with tailored solutions. Third, continue efforts to increase affordable and transitional housing. Finally, provide the funding needed for the facilities and wrap-around services that will guide those in need through the system to a better quality of life. If we continue to do more of the same, we will get the same unsatisfactory results. Most of us know that it is time to do more to help those experiencing homelessness. Let's make 2020 the year we decided to work together to achieve zero functional homeless in our community.

Texto completo: "Bill Harrah's name should be carved in marble for how synonymous he is with Reno."
Greg Ferraro
Lobbyist with a public affairs company that
has represented resorts
and gaming companies
Greg Ferraro remembers being 8 years old and riding his bike to Nixon Avenue in Reno to catch a glimpse of the latest celebrity guest of Bill Harrah. It's where the stars stayed when they were in town to perform at Harrah's. But it wasn't just Charo, Sammy Davis Jr. or Englebert Humperdinck who seemed larger than life to Ferraro, a longtime lobbyist with a public affairs company that has represented resorts and gaming companies. Bill Harrah, the patriarch of the Reno gaming industry, was a celebrity in his own right.
"Bill Harrah's name should be carved in marble for how synonymous he is with Reno," Ferraro said.
"Bill Harrah should be remembered for how he shaped and established the gaming industry as we know it today."
Harrah's little bingo parlor turned into three casinos and eventually expanded into one of the largest gaming companies in the world.
The news that the downtown fixture was sold to a Las Vegas real estate company wasn't unexpected by those who know the gaming industry but did bring up memories and compliments for Harrah.
On Wednesday, when the announcement came that Harrah's Reno was soon to close, Phil Satre walked through the downtown property.
"I'm disappointed for the people who have made long careers there," said Satre, who retired from Harrah's after 25 years in 2005. Satre served as the president and chief executive officer of Harrah's gaming division, becoming the CEO of Harrah's Entertainment and serving as the chairman of the board.
"There are a number of employees I saw, many who worked there when I was there in the 1980s. I shook their hands."
For Satre and others, Harrah's was a place where careers started.
"It's common to hear people say their first job was at Harrah's," he said.
Work ethic of Harrah People have called Harrah one of the most influential figures in gaming. Starting out with a bingo parlor in Venice, Calif., he moved to Reno, where laws made it easier to run a gaming operation.
He later opened a string of bingo parlors in downtown Reno, eventually opening the Harrah's gaming hall.
With an eye for detail, Harrah was known to seek out the best people and the best entertainment.
"Everything needed to be perfect," said Reno-based gaming analyst Ken Adams.
Adams said stars knew they had to do two-week engagements with two shows a night, but Harrah treated them well and they wanted to come back.
He also was known for breaking down racial barriers by hosting performers such as Sammy Davis Jr. and Bill Cosby.
Adams said other casino executive would walk through Harrah's Reno to see how things should be done.
"He set the standard."
Employees would race to replace burned-out lightbulbs before Harrah would walk through.
"It wasn't just the lights. If there was a piece of paper on the floor or a shirt wasn't tucked in correctly, employees knew, it had to be perfect," Adams said.
Satre agreed, adding that Harrah was innovative. He pioneered rewards programs for loyal gamblers and focused on slot machines.
"For others, slot machines were an afterthought and the focus was table games," Satre said. "But he knew to focus on those gamblers."
According to his 1978 obituary in the New York Times, Harrah catered to the small player and focused on bus tours to draw the middle class.
Ferraro said Harrah's was where locals would cash their checks on the weekends when the banks were closed.
"My grandparents called it Hooray, as in hip, hip hooray," Ferraro said. "It was their favorite place to go."
Personal life and cars Harrah became friends with celebrities, often eating meals with them and inviting them to his home at Rancharrah, a lavish 117-acre estate he bought in 1957. Celebrities including Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Debbie Reynolds and Steve Martin have been reported to have stayed at Rancharrah.
And as the gaming business boomed, Harrah started collecting cars, more than 1,400 classic and rare automobiles, many of which are now part of the National Automobile Museum in downtown Reno.
Old news articles about Harrah joked that he also collected wives. He was married seven times, twice marrying the same woman. With his second wife Scherry Teague, he adopted two sons, John and Tony. His third wife was Bobbie Gentry, a popular singer.
His widow when he died in 1978 after heart surgery was Verna Harrison Harrah, a Reno real estate agent.
Former Reno Mayor Bob Cashell remembers seeing Harrah's sons guarded by security as they played with his children. Harrah once took Cashell's sons up to meet actress Raquel Welch.
"I remember Bill brought my kids home and walked them to the door and I was in my pajamas," Cashell said.
But for all the security, celebrities, cars and wives, many described the larger-than-life gaming tycoon as shy.
"His demeanor was one of listening," Satre said. "He didn't talk a lot and made decisions in one-word sentences."
Where business deals and celebrations happened Cashell said Harrah's Steak House was known as the place to do business.
"That's where you would go to shake hands and get a good steak," Cashell said.
Satre's 40th birthday party was at Harrah's Steak House. He still remembers how country singer Loretta Lynn showed up to the restaurant and sang him happy birthday.
"It was a complete surprise," he said.
He also celebrated his recent 70th birthday at Harrah's.
"My children have insisted we are going back at least one more time," Satre said.
Satre said it is hard to imagine downtown Reno without Harrah's, but he was not surprised amid the company's financial problems.
Longtime Reno Gazette Journal business reporter John Stearns covered Harrah's and the gaming industry from 1994-2002.
"To me Harrah's was a fixture and foundation of downtown," Stearns said.
"It no longer being Harrah's symbolizes the change that is happening in Reno."

Fugees: Why it's time for NJ legends to reunite

Texto completo: Ready or not, we believe the time has come for New Jersey's next great musical reunion. What the world needs now are Fugees.
Jersey fresh artists such My Chemical Romance of Belleville, The Misfits from Lodi, New Brunswick's The Gaslight Anthem and the Jonas Brothers out of Wyckoff have all made the rounds on the lucrative reunion circuit in recent years.
But the long-gone Essex County trio of South Orange native Lauryn Hill, the Haitian-born and Newark-raised Wyclef Jean and Irvington native Prakazrel "Pras" Michel were one of American music's defining acts in the mid-1990s. It's time to remind the world why.
They were far from prolific, releasing only two albums — 1994's "Blunted on Reality" and 1996's "The Score."
That sophomore album had monster singles galore — the Roberta Flack cover "Killing Me Softly With His Song," "Fu-Gee-La" and the haunting "Ready or Not" — as well as a cult favorite cover of Bob Marley's "No Woman, No Cry."
While the bombastic "Blunted" didn't make much of a sales splash, "The Score" soared; it was released in February 1996, and by October 1997 it had moved more than 6 million units and reached the top of the Billboard 200, according to a 2016 Billboard retrospective.
Listening back to "The Score" now, it's easy to see why it shook the world.
Nearly a quarter century after its release, the album still resonates as a vividly fluid sonic statement that defies constraints of genre and time, as Brick City rhymes flow seamlessly with samples from The Flamingos and Enya to create a lush, cinematic tapestry of sound.
If anything, the group has only become more timely; their name, an abbreviation of refugees. served as "a reference to the diminished status that poor emigrants from countries such as Haiti encounter in the United States," according to a 1996 Rolling Stone profile.
Decades later, the American government's changing policies toward refugees from around the world entering the country remains a topical, contentious issue.
This was a beautiful North Jersey musical melting pot which earned a pair of 1997 Grammys — Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for "Killing Me Softly With His Song" — and also was nominated for Album of the Year (it lost to Celine Dion's "Falling Into You," co-produced by Roy Bittan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band).
Their too-brief body of work made an undeniable impact. Rolling Stone named "The Score" one of the best albums of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time, while the Asbury Park Press dubbed them the second-greatest hip-hop act to ever come out of New Jersey (behind only Naughty by Nature).
Following "The Score," each of the Fuguees found massive solo success.
The 1997 album "Wyclef Jean presents The Carnival featuring Refugee Allstars" boasted the hit "Gone Till November," and the following year Pras dominated the airwaves with the "Bulworth" soundtrack single "Ghetto Superstar (That is What You Are)."
Then there was the juggernaut of early solo-era Hill. "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" in 1998 had the hits "Doo Wop (That Thing)" and "Everything is Everything," and won five Grammy Awards, becoming the first rap album to ever win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
In the 20-plus years since the Fugees' cultural domination, Jean in particular has remained a highly in-demand producer and collaborator, working with the likes of Whitney Houston (1998's "My Love is Your Love"), Santana (1999's "Maria Maria," the basis of DJ Khaled's "Wild Thoughts"), Destiny's Child (1998's "No, No, No Pt. 2") and Shakira (2005's "Hips Don't Lie").
The next generation of New Jersey musical talent event benefited from Jean's wisdom when he visited Asbury Park in 2018 to work with the youth of the Asbury Park Music Foundation and performed at that year's Asbury Park Music and Film Festival.
But they've only been heard from sporadically as a unit during this millennium; there was a 2004 Brooklyn show filmed for the 2006 documentary "Dave Chapelle's Block Party," then in 2005 a BET Awards appearance, a European tour and a single, "Take it Easy."
As recently as 2018, Pras told New York hip-hop radio station Hot 97 FM that the group had been offered $90 million for a 15-month tour, but both Jean and Hill were non-committal.
Each member has experienced troubles and controversies in recent years. Hill served three months in a Connecticut federal prison in 2013 after failing to pay taxes while Jean's charity, Yéle, was scrutinized in a 2012 New York Times article.
Earlier this year, Pras was charged by U.S. prosecutors with making donations to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign as a proxy for Jho Low, who served as an adviser to former Malaysia prime minister Najib Razak.
Commercial hip-hop was born in New Jersey, thanks to the Sugarhill Gang's landmark 1979 recording of "Rapper's Delight" for Sylvia Robinson's Englewood-based Sugar Hill Records.
The artform's rich, shared history with New Jersey was in the spotlight when MTV brought its Video Music Awards to the Prudential Center in Newark in August 2019.
Several of the state's hip-hop luminaries shared the stage together, including Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature, Redman and Fetty Wap.
Wyclef was there, too, guitar in hand, to perform a verse and chorus of "Gone Till November" and some of "No Woman, No Cry" and then jam out as part of the grand finale on Naughty by Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray."
The celebration couldn't help but feel a little hollow; a singular commemoration of New Jersey's place in hip-hop history deserved more direct Fugees representation than a bit of a Bob Marley song that they also covered.
New Jersey's musical reunion boom in recent years has been great for representing the state's rock 'n' roll and pop history, reminding folks around the world that the Misfits were more than inspiration for a T-shirt line and proving that Gerard Way had a pretty good gig going before he created "Umbrella Academy."
Now it's time to do the same for Jersey's hip-hop legacy.
In their prime, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel created a whole that was somehow greater than the sum of its considerable parts.
The Fugees' lush, boundary-pushing universal sound would hit just as hard today as it did back in 1996, the artists and audience once again vibing on a truly global frequency.
The Fugees, and crew, arrive at New York's Radio City Music Hall in 1996 for the 13th annual MTV Video Music Awards.

Texto completo: I had the extreme good fortune of attending the Booker T. Washington Magnet High School Showcase 2020: All Eyes on Us on Friday, January 10.
I was amazed and inspired with the exceptional talent throughout the program: dance, music, creative writing, photography and visual arts. The efforts of the students, staff and others were truly remarkable in creating such a professional and inspirational program.
I must confess that I had no idea we had such a jewel here in our public school system. The program was even more amazing when you consider the tragic fire in August 2018 that destroyed so much leaving the school housed in an inadequate temporary location in a former elementary school.
I would encourage parents who have children with an interest in arts and academics to explore the opportunities at BTW. The school board, local government and the entire community need to ensure the students and staff have a top notch facility and equipment that will allow them to excel and ensure all programs can be continued.
BTW needs and deserves our full support.

We forget the path we've had with Iran It is amazing how many folks have no memory, or maybe it was happening when they were too young to remember the Iran and United States relationship the last fifty years.
They forget the deposed Shah coming here when the Ayatollah Khomeini returned from France to Iran. What was one the first things chanted in 1979 in the streets of Tehran? "Death to America." Then we had the taking and hostage holding of our personnel in the embassy. We have had a shadow war with Iran ever since.
But underneath all of the regional complications was the potential of a nuclear Iran. Our European allies thought through financial incentives Iran could be convinced it was in their best interest not to have nuclear weapons. We bought into the arrangement and agreed to the appeasement approach. However, reports continued showing their centrifuges and more recently newer ones working to achieve at some point fissionable material for weapons.
While we went along with the appeasement approach, General Soleimani was benefiting from the multi-nation largesse and going from country to country directing their allied terrorists, providing weapons and funding. He was keeping Iran's strategic presence in the region while fighting by proxy our interests. He ramped up the strikes as their economy was imploding due to recently imposed sanctions. He masterminded the strikes against Saudi oil production, the tankers in the Straits and our embassy.
The general was a state sponsored Bin Laden or Al Baghdadi and he deserved the fate the same they did.

Reproductive rights tangled in politics Political madness infects America and members of Congress have asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its Roe v. Wade opinion on abortion.
Supporters of abortion claim a woman's body is her property and she has the right to deny it to a baby.
It must follow that wages she earns with that body are her property and government has no authority to seize them as taxes. That same argument should apply to wages earned by the father of her baby.
"Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to conceive!"

We shouldn't have to pay for racial mistakes from before we were born As we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, I hope we can move closer to his idea of a color-blind society, and stop seeing each other as black or white.
Slavery ended more than 150 years ago. All the slaves, and all the slaveholders, died long ago. Why, then, are some people still talking today about making people pay for slavery?
No one should be made to pay for what he or she did not do. No one should be compensated for what he or she did not suffer.
Let us move on, and not pretend that guilt is hereditary or racial.
Crushing the injustices of the present is what should concern us today, not making people pay for what other people did, or trying to collect what was owed to someone else.

President Trump and the world's problems As I watch "The Squad" and MSNBC, and read the New York Times and Washington Post, I am convinced that President Trump is the main cause of the world's problems.
He clearly is causing global warming. And he so freaked out the Iranian government that they may have shot down a Ukrainian airliner. Trump's rebuilding of the US navy has given the Chinese no choice but to build and militarize South China Sea islands He has upset NATOs European members by insisting they take Europe's security more seriously. Trump has so confused Kim Jong Un that Pyongyang can't dare discard its nuclear weapons. And Trump has deluded even more US "deplorables" into supporting him. Finally, of course, Donald Trump remains an agent of Vladimir Putin.
When, oh when, will it all end ?

Texto completo: Thomas' take helps
reader see both sides
Since I subscribe to both the Sentinel and The New York Times daily papers, I have been reading some duplication of opinions until the Cal Thomas piece dated Jan. 16 ("Reaction to Iran protests feels different this time"). I find much to disagree with in Mr. Thomas' pieces; but, I do not want to become limited in knowledge or to be unaware of the right's positions.
Thomas equates the Iranian protests with welcome regime change and America's need to foster such change while questioning Democrats' reluctance to push this rhetoric. Thanks for printing opposing views so I can research and reflect. After all, regime change did not work out well in Iraq or Libya (which fostered the rise of ISIS). Interventions and war talk may be OK with some boomers; but not this one. Keep educating and challenging your readers.

Washington, Lincoln deserve own holidays
I am 82, and with each passing year, I become more sad, more disappointed, and more frustrated by the continued diminution of respect and honor accorded George Washington (the Father of our Country) and Abraham Lincoln (the Great Emancipator).
Had it not been for George Washington, we would be agonizing today over what our future held as a post-Brexit part of England. Without Lincoln, there might be a Confederacy competing with the Union for hegemony of North America.
These two, arguably America's greatest sons, formerly had their own dedicated national holidays. Now their status has been significantly lessened to a generic Presidents' Day ... with seldom a mention of either Washington or Lincoln.
Martin Luther King Jr., on the other hand, has a national holiday all his own. I don't wish to take anything away from King, who was a worthy champion of civil rights, but he was simply the best-known of those who fought and in some instances died, as he did, for the cause.
I seek to have separate national holidays re-dedicated to both Washington and Lincoln with appropriate celebrations for each. Further, I would prefer that King's day become Civil Rights Day to better honor not just King but all those other towering figures who fought and/or died for black equality.

Shocked by
sheriff's statement
I am shocked and scandalized by Seminole County Sheriff Dennis Lemma's statement that he would not enforce a constitutional amendment regarding an automatic-weapons registry ("Lemma: Registry wouldn't be enforced," Jan. 16). After all, such an amendment, if passed, is a direct command by 60% of the people or more. He is saying that he would defy the expressed will of the electorate?
And - what is a sheriff's job if not to enforce the law? Isn't this dereliction of duty? Would he be subject to criminal penalties himself and removal from office?
But perhaps he's done that himself, since he's up for election later this year. That would mean he was handing prospective opponents an issue sure to appall most voters.

Thanks for lauding Ortega's long life of service
My genuine thanks to the Sentinel Editorial Board and those responsible for naming 97-year-old Richard Ortega a Central Floridian of the Year finalist ("Ortega's military service spanned globe," Jan. 16).
We are a multi-generational culture that can tend to overlook our oldest citizens, leaving them with a sense that their days of social contribution are over. Not so! What a great example of service over self as a foundation for meaningful life. Thank you for lifting him up!

How time escapes in Hartford's West End

Texto completo: Every room in the Bissonnette home thumps like a heartbeat, punctuated by gongs, chimes and tinny bells.
Mark Bissonnette started life as a gearhead in New Britain. Now he repairs antique clocks and timepieces. He haunts rummage and estate sales to look for new challenges, but mostly, the clocks find him - more than 400 so far, packed into his rambling house in Hartford's West End.
At 14, Bissonnette took apart the family Buick. Whatever his father thought of the mess is lost to history. He told his son he was proud of his mechanical acumen, and he never said more when the car never ran right afterward.
Bissonnette grew skilled at dismantling and reassembly. He became a jet engine mechanic with the Air National Guard, and then his wife's grandfather gave him an old humpback mantle clock (so named because of the case's shape), and a jeweler charged him $75 to get it going again. The transaction made Bissonnette - ever the 14-year old - want to take it apart. He did so, and put it back together beautifully. Word got around. He takes the innards to his basement workshop to work on them on his grandfather's lathe. It's a heady feeling to get stopped time started again.
Some of his favorite clocks date back 200 years, when a clock marked the owner as a wealthy forward-thinker. Before clocks, people mostly had a vague idea about time passing, and so clock owners could get a leg up on neighbors who were still judging the hour by the position of the sun. Until the railroads stepped in during the 1880s, the New York Times reported that if you asked for the time in the continental U.S., you'd get no less than 56 different answers, depending where you asked. As train schedules began to link the country, some people resisted Big Government (or Big Railroad) telling people the time, but people eventually acquired clocks - mantel clocks, hall clocks, pocket watches and wristwatches.
Now those devices seem almost beside the point. Time keeps ticking, and to mark it, we have phones that also take pictures and generally rule our lives in the way clocks didn't. By comparison, a clock is not nearly so intrusive. You can always face away from a clock.
Gongs and chimes go off randomly, and that might make you question the repairman's ability to fix clocks until he smiles and tells you that he sets the clocks at different times just to annoy his wife, Kathy, who is a saint.
They've been married for more than 30 years. You find fun where you can. Kathy retaliated recently by handing a box of wine goblets to an aunt. It was her attempt to clear some space, and she knew her husband wouldn't argue with a gift given to a beloved aunt.
Bissonnette gleefully leads a tour to the basement, where the magic happens. He picks up the workings of a clock made in 1792 and gets lost in reverie. Who owned this clock? What faces have turned to it in surprise, in sadness, in acknowledgement that no matter how hard we try, time moves forward and we may have missed something in its passage. In fact, Bissonnette says that the part of the clock that shifts gears and moves the hands forward is called the "escapement of time," and there's a certain poetry that in this house time is, in fact, escaping.
Other things escape with time. You raise children to be adults, and then they come home, dump boxes that contain their detritus and move away. By the basement stairs, Bissonnette waves to a pile of cardboard boxes that belong to an adult child who was en route to China, where it is already night - or morning, depending when you read this.
Sometimes - as when the children grow up and move away - it would be nice to stop time, a little, or at least slow it down.

January thaw is nothing to be celebrated

Texto completo: Most weather forecasters these days proclaim warm winter days with contagious enthusiasm.
A New York Times article about the warm Northeast winter included an image of people smiling after just receiving their order from an ice cream truck. The caption reads, "An ice cream truck catered to people enjoying the springlike weather on the National Mall in Washington on Saturday."
The "#JanuaryThaw" hashtag accompanied untold numbers of Twitter posts.
A forecaster on Connecticut Public Radio announced that this January saw consecutive days in the 60s for the first time in years. He then followed that alarming information with "It's a great time to get outside and take advantage of this gift from mother nature."
Apparently, climate change and all the devastation that comes with it is a "gift from mother nature."
Given the fact that such weather patterns are grave concerns, should we really be happy about #JanuaryThaw and other warm weather events in the middle of winter? As scientists, responsible politicians, advocates and precocious young adults beg Americans to consider our planet's ominous future, why are forecasters undermining outreach by encouraging people to celebrate these phenomena?
George Lakoff's research into the relationship between language and reality reminds us that what we say about the world creates the world. Here's an example. We often use the phrase, "time is money." We might look at that phrase and think it is just a figure of speech; and yet, we earn an hourly or annual income. When you pay for a service, you are usually charged by the hour. And in college, you pay for your classes based on credit hours. It doesn't matter if one class is taught by a Nobel Prize laureate and the other by a teaching assistant, time defines cost, worth, and value.
Literally, we know time and money are separate things, but the reality we create reflects and is reflected by our language.
We also use phrases like, "He's running out of steam," "Her wheels are spinning," and "I need to recharge." Such language has helped shape a reality in which we treat ourselves as if we were machines. In our careers, we are valued based on our production. In relationships, we think of our partners as being high or low maintenance. And when we get sick, we rely on treatments that often address superficial symptoms, the same way we repair a water heater. When it comes to weather forecasts, we might be creating the metaphorical (and therefore real) relationship: "Climate change is convenience."
By now, the idea that language and reality co-create one another is well established in psychology. It's why we encourage positive self-talk in others and why every government censors language in some way, shape or form. Perhaps the translation into public discourse led to the current mess that is "political correctness"?
The idea that we need to be critical of language just so we don't hurt someone's feelings is erroneous and just plain wrong. It's a misinterpretation along the lines of thinking Colin Kaepernick's protests were about the military. As an educator, I'm not necessarily thinking about a student's feelings when I question the practice of grades, for instance. Rather, I'm concerned that the language of grades becomes the reality of learning. I'm worried that our culture defines learning as the accumulation of scores and credits rather than information and power. The same goes for our climate.
Since we know that language and reality exist as inextricable elements, it is absolutely unethical to create an attitude of convenience about climate change. I wonder what the reaction would be if climate change meant a rapidly cooling planet. Since most people associate cold weather with discomfort, would they be more willing to make the necessary changes in their lives? Would they reduce their reliance on modern transportation, stop using plastic, eat from local sources and avoid factory-farmed beef? Would the inconvenience of cold weather overcome the convenience of western civilization?
All I can do is wonder. In the meantime, maybe we can just be clear that "unseasonably warm weather" is a dangerous symptom of a warming planet, not a pleasant convenience.

Texto completo: Louis C.K., the once-influential comedian disgraced after acknowledging his sexual misconduct with multiple women, is coming to Phoenix.
He is scheduled for three nights of stand-up comedy at the Orpheum Theatre on Feb. 21, 22 and 23. He is also scheduled to perform at Tucson Music Hall on Feb. 24.
It's a comeback of sorts for the comedian, who created the critically acclaimed and Peabody Award-winning "Louie," but whose stunning fall from grace served as one of the more striking examples of the power of the #MeToo movement.
In November 2017, the New York Times wrote a lengthy, heavily sourced and graphic article detailing C.K.'s behavior with multiple women. It was shocking and disturbing, though rumors had swirled in comedy circles for years. This, though, was a thorough examination leaving little doubt.
If there were any, C.K. dispelled it. The next day he released a statement confirming the Times report.
"These stories are true," he said.
Later in the statement he said, "The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I've tried to learn from them. And run from them."
What made the accusations and the admission so surprising is that C.K. was right — in the comedy world, by virtue of his success and his reputation as a comic, he did wield power and influence. He was admired, as kind of a comic's comic, someone who would wade into tricky waters with confidence. Sometimes the comedy worked, sometimes it didn't. But he was fearless.
And gross, as the details of the Times story — which he confirms — show.
This took place just as the #MeToo movement was taking hold. While many men whose actions were reprehensible, and sometimes criminal, were being brought down, there often was little thought to what would come next. That wasn't what was important.
But C.K. seemed to indicate remorse and a willingness to learn at the time.
"I have spent my long and lucky career talking and saying anything I want," he said at the conclusion of his statement. "I will now step back and take a long time to listen."
FX Networks ended its relationship with him, and the film "I Love You, Daddy," which he wrote, directed and starred in, was shelved.
In August 2018 C.K. made an unannounced appearance at a New York comedy club. He has since resumed touring. Audience accounts of the shows say he doesn't directly address the accusations or the admission — another disappointment from a comic who has no trouble embracing controversy.
If he listened, you wonder, what did he hear?

Violence, art and social media Olivia Gatwood, a poet with a YouTube following, turns the tables on fear, obsession

Texto completo: If Olivia Gatwood had never found poetry, she would probably be dead by now. She said this nonchalantly backstage before a performance at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg for several hundred fans.
A few minutes later, she was slathering lavender oil on her tattooed arms. "I don't like perfume," she said. "It makes me feel like a dead lady - like I'm being embalmed."
Despite all the death talk and the fact that her latest collection of poetry, "Life of the Party," revolves around violence against women, Gatwood, 27, is easygoing and effervescent (not to mention resourceful - backstage, she turned avocados into impromptu guacamole with little more than a wine key and a coffee stirrer).
She recently finished her tour across the United States with singer Ari Chi and cellist Cailin Nolte. Gatwood plans and funds her own tours and often handles the transportation herself, driving a 10-passenger van from city to city.
Gatwood started performing poetry in high school; soon after graduating, she was part of Brave New Voices, a poetry festival that has been featured on HBO. But many of her fans found her through YouTube, where she has cultivated a mostly female audience with performances of poems such as "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" and "Ode to My Bitch Face" that have garnered hundreds of thousands of views. A children's book she wrote with Mahogany L. Browne and Elizabeth Acevedo, "Woke: A Young Poet's Call to Justice," is scheduled for release in March.
Gatwood grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city with more than its share of violence (its metro area had one of the United States' highest murder rates in 2018). The city's struggles, she said, affected her from a young age. In her poem "BODY COUNT: 13," she describes the West Mesa murders, an unsolved case involving the disappearance and murder of 11 women and a fetus whose remains were found on the outskirts of Albuquerque a decade after they were buried. She was 17 when the bodies were discovered.
Her parents, whom she described as hippies, never set a curfew and didn't always shield her from life. Her mother was a sex educator before becoming an HIV epidemiologist - Gatwood remembers having a stuffed animal in the shape of the chlamydia virus and knowing about HIV when she was 5 - and her father, who according to Gatwood resembles Ted Bundy, was a middle-school teacher from whom she inherited her emotional nature.
Her father, Byron Gatwood, said she was fixated on language early on. "She was very interested always in the dynamics of relationships, the idea of how people get along and what the rules are, whether they're written or not," he said.
"Life of the Party" is largely a memoir, with memories of friendship as well as violence. In "Mans/Laughter," Gatwood shares, among other things, the sexual harassment she endured from her boss while working at a bakery in high school. Her book doesn't mention that as a 15-year-old, she organized other women who had been victimized and reported the bakery to the EEOC. She eventually received a settlement of more than $10,000.
"I encouraged her not to. I said they're not going to do anything about it. And she, she plowed ahead totally on her own," her mother, Jill Gatwood, said. "I thought it was good that she was standing up for herself."
"Life of the Party" is also a meditation on Olivia Gatwood's obsession with the true crime genre and her long-running fear of male violence. "I've always been really afraid of men," she said. "I think that's really rational for a young girl to feel that way."
Living in a ground-floor apartment in Boston prompted much of the work in the book. In an author's note that details her many sleepless nights, she writes: "I was afraid of something very specific: a man climbing through my first-floor apartment window, which realistically could have been popped open with a butter knife, and strangling me in my bed." After she finished writing it, she said, she slept her first full night by herself.
Melissa Lozada-Oliva, a poet who hosts the podcast "Say More" with Gatwood and who said they first bonded over the gaps in their front teeth, said that she knew Gatwood struggled with the book. That was partly because Gatwood sought in her writing to address "her privilege as a white woman - acknowledging who gets to talk about violence and who gets to talk about violence being inflicted on them," Lozada-Oliva said.
During the Brooklyn performance, Gatwood was greeted with roaring applause when she read "Ode to My Bitch Face," which is just what it sounds like, and "Ode to the Women of Long Island" ("who / when I show them the knife I carry in my purse / tell me it's not big enough"). Afterward, she spent more than an hour signing books and getting to know some of the teenage girls and young women who came.
Mary Cornwell and Abigail Buchholz, a mother and daughter who drove five hours from Virginia, were among them. Buchholz first discovered Gatwood's work on YouTube and shared it with Cornwell, who said the poems resonated with her as both a woman and a mother. "It's beautiful and relevant to all generations," she said.
At the beginning of Gatwood's writing career, she wanted her audience to be "misogynistic men on the internet," the people who perhaps needed to hear her work the most.
After many death and rape threats, she shifted her focus.
"It's less important to me to change the minds of the people who want me dead," Gatwood said. "And more important that I make girls feel less alone."

There's a growing problem in the opioid fight: diarrhea medication

Resumen: In September, the FDA stepped in to limit abuse of Imodium and other anti-diarrhea drugs. Apparently it's a growing problem.

Texto completo: This lends itself to way more questions than answers, a friend of mine wrote on Facebook the other day above a weird photo.
It showed three boxes of Imodium A-D — that trusted anti-diarrhea medication — lying crumpled in a parking lot. What nightmarish emergency, he wondered, could have possibly led to this?
Turns out, it was nightmarish. Just not in the way most of us would think.
A few commenters on the post explained what was probably going on: People battling opioid withdrawal sometimes gobble Imodium by the fistful.
Imodium is the brand-name of loperamide: a drug that, if taken in gigantic quantities, can produce an opioid-like high — and present serious dangers to a person's health.
I had no idea this was a problem. But apparently it’s nothing new.
According to U. S. News & World Report, the U. S. National Poison Data System reported a 90 percent spike in loperamide overdoses between 2010 and 2016.
Abusing the drug can, naturally, lead to horrific constipation. But it can also wreak havoc on your heart – usually through irregular heartbeats, the New York Times reported in 2016. Back then, overdose deaths had reportedly occurred in at least five states.
"Most physicians just recently realized loperamide could be abused, and few look for it," the story read. "There is little if any national data on the problem, but many toxicologists and emergency department doctors suspect that it is more widespread than scattered reports suggest. "
A 2019 paper out of Rutgers University confirmed that. It said loperamide fatalities have spiked over the last few years.
All that has finally caused the FDA to step in.
In September, the agency announced it would limit Imodium A-D, Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief and Be Health Loperamide HCI capsules — as well as their generic offshoots — to 48 milligrams per package, or about 24 capsules per box. The maximum daily dosage is eight milligrams.
“Abuse of loperamide continues in the United States and taking higher than recommended doses can cause serious heart problems that can lead to death,” acting FDA Commissioner Ned Sharpless said in the release.
But the FDA isn’t going to come crashing through pharmacy windows if stores don’t follow those guidelines. The new rules are nothing more than voluntary.
That becomes pretty clear if you take a stroll through a local pharmacy.
Battling dirty looks from pharmacy workers and customers alike, I scoped out several stores around Evansville this week and found a variety of anti-diarrhea displays.
Some kept Imodium locked in clear plastic cases. Others sported cage-free boxes that held as much as 96 milligrams per package.
I suppose you could rant about how all this is a sign of a deteriorating culture. I can’t even buy diarrhea medication anymore without feeling like a drug addict!
The saddest part for me, though, is that people feel they have to resort to this. I hope whoever left those crumpled boxes behind can find the help they need to kick their addiction.

Texto completo: For every Greta Thunberg and school-skipping climate change protester, there is another member of Generation Z buying inexpensive clothes on a smartphone.
Their purchasing choices - fueled by influencer culture and catered to by a new wave of ultra-fast-fashion retailers such as Fashion Nova, PrettyLittleThing and Missguided - are as much about how an outfit will look on social media as in the real world.
Two Gen Z shoppers, one in America and one in Britain, invited us into their homes to talk about what they buy, and why. All of them work after school or save money to pay for their own purchases.
Mia Grantham is a 16-year-old British high school student. She lives with her father and her younger sister in Wilmslow, England. Her bedroom is small but immaculately kept, with a pillow shaped like a speech bubble reading "You've Got This" on her bed.
Mia's interest in clothes ramped up about 18 months ago, when she started getting an allowance and attracting followers on her social media accounts. She has more than 1,500 followers on Instagram, gets around 500 views per story on Snapchat and spends three hours per day on her iPhone XR (about five hours on weekends).
Her favorite going-out look is a red dress. She owns 14 of them.

Q: How often do you shop?
A: I browse every single day - at least once - on the PrettyLittleThing phone app. It's my favorite, and I don't look anywhere else, except if I see something on an Instagram influencer I like. Normally I look at shopping apps at the end of the day before bed for about 10 to 15 minutes. But if there is an event coming up that I want a new outfit for, then I could browse for more than an hour. I don't really go to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Q: Why is PrettyLittleThing your favorite fashion brand?
A: I pay 8.99 pounds as part of a yearly subscription, which gives me unlimited next-day delivery on anything I buy. I know all the delivery people really well now - they always know when I have plans on a Friday or Saturday night. I buy something at least once a week. Seventy percent of the time I send some ordered items back.

Q: How many pieces of clothing do you think you've bought in 2019?
A:Eighty? One hundred? Those are pieces I've kept.

Q: What is your favorite piece that you've bought?
A:The ones I probably wear the most are gray leggings that cost 2.50 pounds. For going out, I bought a silky red dress with a cutout for a house party. I've worn it out three times, which is a lot for me.

Q: What else do you look for?
A:Social media is a big consideration. I'm on Snapchat and Instagram, and occasionally Facebook. I take selfies for social media every single time I go out. I'm on Snapchat the most because of its messenger function, then Instagram, where I have both a public and a private account and spend an hour per day.
Q: What do you think of sustainable fashion?
A: I am hearing more and more about it because a lot of brands are now bringing out sustainable fashion capsule collections, where clothes are made out of recycled materials, for example. A lot look the same as the normal collection but cost a few pounds more. But if I'm honest, I do think: Why would I pay more, when I can get the same for less?

Andrea Vargas, an 18-year-old freshman at Hofstra University, loves hunting for sales. She looks for them on websites such as PrettyLittleThings and Boohoo, as well as physical stores like H&M.
"I go shopping when the season sales are on," she said one Saturday night at her family's home in Farmingdale, New York. She commutes to school and spends most weekend nights out with friends. Her plan for this particular evening was to go to P.F. Chang's with three girlfriends.
Her absolute favorite piece of clothing is a red plush jacket."It's just so cute," Vargas said. "I feel like it dresses up an outfit."
Vargas pays for her clothes herself, using money she earns by working at Target. The red jacket cost her around $40, and she said it was worth every penny.
But, she said, "I feel like there's no point in spending $40 on a T-shirt. Especially since I'm in college, I need to buy all these books."
Vargas guessed she had purchased between 100 and 200 items this year, including shoes and jewelry, and that her wardrobe comprises 500 or 600 total pieces.
She doesn't generally check where her clothing is made, and she doesn't feel guilty about how much of it she has. After she's done wearing something, it can have a second life.
"My mom is from El Salvador and my dad is from Nicaragua," she said. "They're not wealthy countries, so I like to give back to people who don't have a lot."
She estimates she wears each piece 15 times before ultimately donating it or selling it on Depop - but she also doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing every day on Instagram.
"If I have a shirt in one of my previous pictures, I try not to take a picture again in it," she said. "I don't like to repeat."

Texto completo: For most of us, we know what needs to be done to reach the next level.
If you want to improve health and fitness, we don't need another fad diet ... we need to exercise more and eat healthier food.
If you want to close more deals, you probably need to make more cold calls. If you want to ace the big exam, studying more is a pretty clear path.
Indeed, the problem most of us face isn't figuring out what to do; it's actually doing it.
Starting at a new effort can feel overwhelming and discouraging. That first gym workout is awful before, during, and especially after. Penning the first few pages of that novel you've always wanted to write is going to be arduous and difficult.
Here's the good news — the first few reps of any new skill, project, or discipline are the hardest ... by far.
The first time you've jogged a mile in 20 years is far more challenging than running 10 miles after training for months.
The first few times you get on a stage to present are a hundred times scarier than speaking in front of 1000 people once you've had some experience and practice.
The beauty of progress is that the difficulty curve geometrically decreases with persistence. In other words, you not only get better with practice, but it also becomes easier. If doing a particular thing feels too tough, realize that you only need to endure through the first few attempts.
'Easier over time' is a liberating mantra. It means that even the most intimidating challenges can be conquered if we can manage to suffer through the first early steps. The willpower needed to accomplish greatly isn't that of superheroes. We mere mortals can do incredible things if we can just tough it out in the early days of a new pursuit.
Creativity gets easier over time. Leadership gets easier over time. Sales gets easier over time. Managing conflict gets easier over time. Exercise gets easier over time. Learning a new language ... you guessed it. Easier over time.
I've been writing a weekly blog for over 10 years now, and I can tell you firsthand that it is easier over time.
When you're deep in a challenge, facing the inevitable struggle and want to give up, just remember that your next attempt (and the one after that) will eventually become easier.
What new skill, project, or habit have you put off because it just felt too difficult? Give it a fresh look — with the 'easier over time' lens — to boost your confidence, resolve, and ultimately results.

Texto completo: "Who is Val Demings?"
The New York Times headline this week was one among many across Florida and the nation following the sophomore Orlando congresswoman's selection as one of seven impeachment managers for President Trump's Senate trial.
Demings, D-Orlando, has been an established figure on the Central Florida political scene since her days as Orlando's first woman police chief, later running unsuccessfully for Congress in 2012 and Orange County Mayor in 2014 before winning her 10th District seat in 2016.
But her memorable moments during the impeachment hearings - as a member of both the House Intelligence Committee that investigated the Ukraine scandal and the Judiciary Committee that passed articles of impeachment - have since turned her into one of the Democratic Party's biggest breakout stars nationwide.
"[Her] performance in the committee hearings was a revelation, an ex-cop who knows how to talk to perps," wrote Esquire.
And her role as an impeachment manager has only increased her profile.
"Impeachment manager offers law enforcement experience," wrote the Times. "Val Demings for Vice President? Idea being pushed," asked Florida Politics.
'How history views it'
Aubrey Jewett, a professor of political science at the University of Central Florida, said the appointment "raised the viability of her profile, nationally and within the Democratic party - and even at home in her Central Florida district.
"For the most part, it's probably good for her political career," Jewett said. "But it carries some risk of backlash."
Jewett referenced former Republican U.S. Rep. Bill McCollum, another Central Florida Congress member who served as an impeachment manager for President Clinton's trial in 1999. Clinton was impeached on counts of perjury and obstruction related to his affair with Monica Lewinsky, but was acquitted in the Senate.
McCollum raised his profile as well, but impeachment proved to be unpopular in Florida and nationwide, Jewett said. McCollum ran for U.S. Senate and lost to Democrat Bill Nelson amid jabs from Democrats that GOP House members were too partisan in impeaching Clinton.
"If she chooses to run statewide, she'll certainly have better name recognition in the state of Florida," Jewett said. "But it also depends on how impeachment turns out, and how history views it."
Jewett also cautioned that while her police background is mostly helpful politically, "in some circles of the Democratic Party, it might work against her."
"There's a very strong faction in the Democratic Party right now ... that in their view, traditional law enforcement often meant enforcement of laws that hurt minorities disproportionately and look at the justice system as unfair," Jewett said, citing the slogan "Kamala is a cop" used by left-wing opponents against U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, a former prosecutor. "Not all Democrats think that, but that segment is growing fast."
Demings' time as police chief also included one of the rare blots on her record, when she received a written censure in 2009 as punishment for not properly securing her gun in her car.
The 'Bad guys'
Demings herself wouldn't bite at questions about her political future, telling reporters Friday, "I have got to stay very focused on the work in front of me. You'll have plenty of time to talk about moving forward. Right now with every bit of energy and intelligence and motivation that I have, I am focused on this impeachment trial."
Demings is the only manager who isn't a lawyer. But she cited her nearly three decades with the Orlando Police Department as providing the necessary experience for dealing with a trial that has only happened twice before in the nation's history.
Trump was impeached on counts of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for his role in withholding military aid to Ukraine at the same time he was pressuring its president to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.
"Serving as a law enforcement officer through every rank on the police department, I've seen the effect of good government and good leaders," she said. "And I've seen the effects of bad governance and bad leaders. And I believe the on-the-ground experience that I have, dealing with complicated very tough issues [will help]."
She served as an internal affairs investigator at OPD, and "when we talk about investigating our own, I've done that," she said. "That's really what we're doing now. This is about the wrongdoings of a person who has been given tremendous responsibility, who has been given the sacred trust of the American people, and chose to abuse them. ... I believe, as a law enforcement officer, I've been in this place before. And he will be held accountable."
As for the recent allegations from Lev Parnas, the indicted Rudy Giuliani associate who has since turned on Trump and his personal lawyer Giuliani and claimed "Trump knew exactly what was going on" in Ukraine, Demings again brought up her police background.
"He has his issues," Demings said of Parnas. "But I think back to some cases we put together in the police department. When we're investigating bad guys, we usually use bad guys to make cases on other bad guys. So I'm not sure how credible Mr. Parnas is. But he's sure been doing a lot of talking. And if you connect the dots ... [He's] corroborated a lot of the information or testimony that we've already received."
'History takes care of itself'
In any case, Demings said she hoped enough Republicans join Democrats in the Senate to be able to call Parnas and others as witnesses, but that the managers were prepared to move forward with their case nonetheless. Her specific role in the trial will be determined at a Sunday meeting, she added.
McCollum, one of only a handful of people who knows what it's like to be in Demings' shoes right now, said she can expect her role to change and evolve as the trial goes on.
"I started out preparing witnesses," McCollum said. Then midstream, lead manager Henry Hyde "was not comfortable with one of the particular people chosen [to speak]. I ended up with a half-hour summary of the case, talking about obstruction of justice, perjury, and how it all tied together in one strain. ... And then I did the close."
Demings, he said, needs to focus on her role and let her staff deal with everything else that comes up during the trial.
As for what it means to be a manager, "It's not so much what it means to her or me. I took it as a very solemn thing. I did not particularly want to do it, and I wish the president did not put us in that position. ... But I felt very strongly about it. And having listened to her in the Judiciary [hearings]," he said, he believed she does too.
In the end, McCollum said, "History takes care of itself."
Demings echoed McCollum in stressing she was only part of a greater process.
"This is not about me," she said. "It's not about Donald Trump, and it's not about Donald Trump's defenders. This is about protecting our democracy."

Texto completo: THE WITCHES ARE COMING by Lindy West (Hachette, 272 pp., $27)
Lindy West, a New York Times columnist and the bestselling author of "Shrill," returns with a new book of powder-keg political and activist essays "The Witches Are Coming." The collection aims to place the #MeToo movement in context while leaving plenty of room for West's trademark acerbic asides and millennial meanderings about the Goop Marketplace and the virtues (or lack thereof) of dresses with pockets.
The cover describes the book as "Essays From the Bestselling Author of 'Shrill'," while West calls them chapters. The eighteen titled sections at times defy both descriptors, favoring something closer to "notes," the term she used for her first book. There is less scene, more exposition; less vulnerability, more swearing; less character-building, more, well, just, more. More anger, preening, intelligence and implication.
Many of her usual targets are taken aim at here, including fat-shaming, sexism and the cruelty of faceless internet trolls. But West is often most effective when she pulls the unexpected into her laser view, such as the creators of "South Park," Adam Sandler's movies, or Chip and Joanna Gaines of the television series "Fixer Upper."
In "How to Be a Girl," West takes on the board game turned movie "Clue": "I gave 'Clue' a lot. My time, my love, my brain space, my video store rental fees. 'Clue,' in turn, gave me something back: my first inkling of myself as a woman situated somewhere on a scary, hierarchical, baffling, shifting matrix of women."
She continues to dissect the way she considered the four main female characters in "Clue." "I remember, as a child, looking from each of these women to the next, and trying to figure out which kind of woman I might grow up to be." She decides that she is Mrs. Peacock. "At age 8, the closest analog I could find for myself in my favorite movie - a movie with more female characters than most - was a corrupt senator's wife who was older than my father and dressed like a Rainforest Café."
West is a funny feminist, an oxymoron she untangles in one of her strongest essays "Joan" about comic Joan Rivers. Along with the expected brilliant humor, West's writing can also be beautiful and bewitching. Some favorite observations include "My husband plays the trumpet, which is sort of a loud pretzel originally invented to blow down the walls" or "To live in Seattle is to exist, perpetually, in the bargaining stage of grief."
Mostly, though, West does not give in to the beauty of the line, training her eye instead on pure impact, and while the energy here is certainly palpable, at times the episodic structure of "The Witches Are Coming" makes it feel more akin to listening to a podcast. The caustic jiujitsu is still on the page, but can feel clogged by the incessant ALL CAPS, whole paragraphs of exclamation points, text talk ["(knife emoji, skull emoji, coffin emoji)"] and single-sentence paragraph conclusion zingers.
One gets the sense that this shorthand is the result of having Important Things to Say at a time when the stakes could not be higher. "I used to think of my job as digesting the news, digesting the chatter, then saying what still needed to be said - whatever hard truths people were avoiding or invisible biases they were overlooking," she writes. West continues to employ history, logic, and her own brand of extreme truth-telling in this new collection, a well-timed rallying cry as we enter into the next election cycle.

Texto completo: "I hope you're not feeling indecisive," one of my dinner guests quipped as he handed me a clipboard gripping several sheets of lavender paper. Laser-printed there were thorough descriptions of more than 30 draft beers, meads and ales, grouped roughly into categories like "The Maltier Side" and "Sour/Funk." I had known about The King's Head Pub's encyclopedic tap selection of mostly local brews, but I wasn't prepared for the breadth of choices - especially during holiday beer season, when breweries produce their very quirkiest concoctions.
"Don't worry," our server said, when he saw the adults at the table hunched over our clipboards as if cramming for an exam. "I'll help you find something you'll love."
"OK, what kind of beer do you think I like?" one of my guests joked, turning to face him with a grin.
"Well, I know that you two are getting Shirley Temples ($2.50)," he said, pointing at my two pre-teen guests with the nub of his pen. "But as for the grownups, I'll need a little more to go on. I'm not the Sorting Hat!"
As promised, he guided us capably, proposing the hoppy Norway Brewing Company's Maine State of Mind ($6), when we were looking for a lighter Pilsner as well as Foundation Brewing's Josef ($6.50), a crisper, yeastier classic version in the same Czech style. When one of my guests asked for something toastier with more malt, he hit another bulls-eye with the Norway Bam's Brown Ale ($7).
That knowledge extended to the seasonal novelties as well. Feeling festive, my guests and I opted to taste two beers with flavor profiles that riff on eggnog. I enjoyed the Burley Oak Brewery Coquito J.R.E.A.M. ($7), a lactose-finished sour ale that tasted like its namesake, cinnamon-sprinkled Puerto Rican eggnog. And as much as the Wu Tang Clan nod ("Juice Rules Everything Around Me") in its name made me laugh, I found the beer overly sweet. Indeed, it might have made a better dessert than the perfectly respectable homemade cheesecake with blueberries that capped my meal ($8).
Foundation Brewing's Nog Nog, Who's There ($6), a lactose-finished collaboration with Portland's Chaval restaurant, was better-balanced - round and nutty (thanks to almond extract), with a fruity tartness that was, as my server described it, "like an entire apple pie in a glass."
"Our entire front of house team is all beer lovers. For a lot of people who aren't beer aficionados, they can get intimidated when they walk into a place that has 35-plus taps. But (bar manager) Mike Black is really educated. He writes detailed notes on the menus and trains all our staff," executive chef Tory Bridgman told me.
Bridgman, who has worked behind the scenes at several other Portland restaurants including East Ender and Hot Suppa, splits his time between King's Head and its sister business, JÃ¤ger, on Wharf Street. And while the two pubs both offer extensive draft options, JÃ¤ger's abridged menu of bratwursts and potato salads is about one-fifth the size of the menu at The King's Head.
"The food at The King's Head isn't as heavy, either," Bridgman said. "It's still comforting, but it's approachable. I call it beer-forward and broad-reaching, but nothing intimidating."
In practice, that means New American gastropub dishes that - like a kitten wearing a bell on its collar - provide plenty of warning of any impending culinary surprises. Take the ground lamb burger ($16), whose menu listing signposts its Mediterranean-inspired ingredients: apricot marmalade, garlic, bubbling cheese and a house-made aioli stirred through with a fine chiffonade of fresh sage leaves. "Oh yeah," our server said when my guest ordered the burger. "That sage has got a punch to it."
A flatbread appetizer ($12) takes that same ground lamb and transports it further south, adding curlicues of spice and heat from harissa paste and cumin to create a merguez-style sausage. Bridgman crumbles it across a thin dough, then adds layers of Havarti cheese and house-pickled red onions, jalapeÃ±os and Fresno chiles. There's a lot going on here (including a sticky balsamic-and-honey drizzle), but against all odds, it works.
So too, crunchy, puckery discs of kosher dill pickle soaked in buttermilk, then dredged in cornmeal grits and deep-fried ($9). Or even the Italian-inspired deep-fried burrata ($11), which despite its quickly staling focaccia sidekick still managed to wind up one of the meal's highlights, due in no small part to a green-olive-and-caper tapenade that sparkled with lemony aromatic tartness.
Seafood dishes are less successful. Pre-picked lobster meat in the lobster roll ($25) was overcooked on my recent visit, and the mammoth, butter-brushed brioche bun that cradled it had perhaps experienced its freshest days sometime earlier in the week. And while I applaud King's Head's use of locally caught, well-seasoned Casco Bay haddock in the fish and chips entrÃ©e ($18), the clam-fry-based batter surrounding the fish was as thick as a plaster cast and nearly as impenetrable.
Better dishes that evening included the classics you'd expect to be great at a gastropub: a gorgeously grilled New York strip steak served with fingerlings oven-browned in duck fat and grasshopper-green Brussels sprouts ($28); as well as the King's Burger ($15), a hefty eight-ounce brisket-and-chuck patty grilled until blushing medium-rare and plated alongside a tumble of crisp French fries hand-cut from Green Thumb Farms potatoes.
Those of us with fries kept offering them to our less fortunate table-mates throughout the night. "I bet he'd like a fry," the 10-year-old seated next to me said, pointing up at the taxidermied wild boar's head hanging above the men's bathroom. His parents chuckled and wondered aloud if the same could be said of the 10-point buck over the bar or the skipjack over the door to the kitchen.
"The owner (Justin O'Connor) is a big hunter," our server said as he passed by, overhearing our conversation and stopping by to explain how the space was - until 2014 - a storage area in a disused portion of what is now the Pierce Atwood building. As he explained, I looked around the wood-panel-and-exposed-brick walls and marveled at how the 74-seat space felt much older. "Nope," our server said. "Everyone is just really comfortable with this room and with each other. Maybe that's it?"
I wasn't sure about that. But one thing I do know is that, if you peer through the window to the kitchen, you'll see some home-brewed, pep-talk graffiti inside. "Best Kitchen Staff In Portland!!" it reads in what looks to be smudgy brown finger paint. From what my guests and I experienced this week, I'd concur that the kitchen staff is pretty good, but the knowledgeable, attentive front-of-house team members? Well, they're even better.

Texto completo: THE CITIZENS UNITED case after 10 years? Let's recall first what that case was about and why a number of First Amendment aficionados such as myself have been drawn to support what has become one of the most maligned Supreme Court cases in American history.
In 2008, Citizens United was a conservative organization with a yearly budget of about $12 million. A small portion of that money was contributed by for-profit corporations. Citizens United prepared a film harshly denouncing Hillary Clinton at a time when she seemed to be the most likely Democratic nominee for president. (Barack Obama was later nominated and elected.)
Taken as a whole, as Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy later observed in his majority opinion in the case, the movie was “a full length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President," a presentation that sought to persuade viewers that she was “unfit for the Presidency." But legislation then in effect criminalized airing — on television, cable, or satellite — advocacy for or against a candidate for president within 60 days of an election and 30 days before a primary if it was even partially funded by a corporation. As a result, the documentary could not be shown at times most likely to persuade viewers whom to vote for — or in this case, against.
From any First Amendment perspective, that was intolerable. No speech is as protected under the First Amendment as political speech and no political speech is as important as speech advocating whom to vote for, or against, for president. That is why the ACLU responded to the Citizens United ruling by explaining that it could “not support campaign finance regulation premised on the notion that the answer to money in politics is to ban political speech."
Yet because some of the money that funded Citizens United came from corporations, its political advocacy was silenced at the very time it could have had the greatest impact. The 5-4 decision in Citizens United held that any law having that effect violated the First Amendment and that corporations that had contributed to Citizens United could spend money from their corporate treasuries advocating the election or non-election of political candidates just as individuals could. The amounts spent, as federal law required, had to be publicly disclosed. But just as individuals could not constitutionally be limited in the amounts they could expend on political speech, neither could corporations.
Much of the public response to the Citizens United ruling was apoplectic. People who fully supported controversial Supreme Court rulings that, under the First Amendment, Nazis must be allowed to march and American flags to be burned, were appalled that corporations could play a serious role in the electoral process. The New York Times, itself owned by a corporation that was then the owner of this newspaper, spoke for many when it denounced the ruling on the ground that it would “thrust politics back to the robber-baron era of the 19th century" by allowing “corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections." The San Francisco Chronicle predicted that “voters should prepare for the worst: cash-drenched elections presided over by free-spending corporations." The Washington Post warned that “corporate money, never lacking in the American political political process, may now overwhelm . . . the contribution of individuals."
But nothing of the sort has occurred in the 10 years since the court's ruling. What is true is that since Citizens United and as a sort of follow-up to it, so-called “super" political action committees were created, into which both individuals and corporations have made contributions. Those from individuals have dwarfed those from corporations. Here are the numbers from the entire 2016 election cycle — all federal elections from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. In that entire time, so-called super PACs received a total of $1.8 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of that amount, $1.05 billion came from individuals; labor organizations and other entities contributed $260 million; the contributions of all corporations totaled $113 million. When we compare the largest contributors in 2016, the 10 largest contributions from individuals totaled $377 million; the top 10 corporate contributions totaled less than $39 million. The figures were similar in 2018, a non-presidential year in which a total of about $1.5 billion was contributed to super PACs, of which less than $68 million came from corporations.
As these vast numbers suggest and as is no secret, there remain enormous, often incomparable, disparities in the amount of money held by those in the top fraction of the top one percent of our population and the rest of the public. This might be addressed by tax or other economically focused legislation. As the ACLU has urged, it should not be addressed by limiting speech about who should be elected.
As Justice Kennedy put it in Citizens United , speech is “the means to hold officials accountable to the people" and “political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it by design or inadvertence." That was true a decade ago and it remains true today.

THE FOREVER PEOPLE OF SILICON VALLEY CHIP WALTER CHRONICLES CUTTING-EDGE QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY

Texto completo: Contrary to popular opinion, death is not inevitable. At least not for too much longer.
That's the startling and perhaps disturbing conclusion author Chip Walter comes to in "Immortality, Inc.: Renegade Science, Silicon Valley Billions, and the Quest to Live Forever."
The Pittsburgh-based science writer tracks several years of work by visionary scientists funded by the likes of Google. They're seeking not just to help us live longer, healthier lives. They're trying to actually end aging and thus extend human life indefinitely - or, as Mr. Walter puts it, to "cure death."
The account unfolds mostly since 2013, when Google launched Calico, a biotech company focused on aging. The gallery of characters features Calico founder Larry Page, Google Ventures' Bill Maris and Apple board chair Art Levinson. Science types include famed engineer and futurist Ray Kurzweil, who believes human and artificial intelligence is bound to fuse, in what he calls "the singularity"; biochemist Craig Venter, a key figure behind the Human Genome Project; and Aubrey de Grey, an eccentric Brit who pioneered the notion that aging is a disease.
If some of this material rings familiar from newsmagazine headlines, Chip Walter brings it all between two covers. He offers intriguing glimpses into his protagonists' personal lives - some of them lost parents early or had other formative experiences with death - alongside accounts of how all that investment money was assembled. And he provides cogent explanations of the science, for instance cataloging all the ways our very cells age.
There are also entertaining passages on animal aging. Genetic researchers, for instance, have extended the lifespans of laboratory earthworms and mice. Others ponder creatures including the bowhead whale, Greenland shark and naked mole rat, none of whom seem to grow old. While the scientific challenges remain daunting, Mr. Walter concludes that advances in computing power, gene-editing technology, and more, make victory over death, to use Mr. Kurzweil's term, "inevitable."
"Immortality, Inc." isn't always easy to follow: It's stuffed with a dizzying array of the names of people, corporations and projects, shifts in point of view, and leaps forward and backward in time. Readers might also find Mr. Walter's writing style distracting. He does offer some nice turns of phrase. At one point, Mr. Levinson wonders whether one newfangled technology is "a big fat lamp without a genie." And when Venter's computer scientists blanch at a technical challenge, he looks at them "like a saddened rector who had caught the altar boys sipping the church wine."
But often, Mr. Walter seems inspired by the antic style of Tom Wolfe (who is honored on the dedication page), and it doesn't always suit. We get sentences like, "[N]ow the human race had its A-Team on the case and woe betide the avenging angel, death's nemesis." (Pardon?) Elsewhere, Mr. Walter offers, "It was one of those nights when the whole spine of the Milky Way rises up like diamond dust and you can feel the great wheel of the cosmos hold you in its galactic hand"- a festival of mixed metaphors.
But in a book like this, a bigger concern is the lack of dissenting voices. As New York Times health reporter Nicholas Bakalar wrote in 2018, "[N]o serious scientist believes in immortality." Yet Chip Walter stakes out a spot on the technophile end of the spectrum - "Science is going to cheat death," he writes - and the fact that critics have real doubts about this research gets scant attention.
Similarly shortchanged are worries that making people immortal might have, you know, downsides. The first named critic doesn't appear till halfway into the book, and his concerns - such as, how would we accommodate all the extra people? - get just one page. Billions of Earth's human denizens still struggle to get by. Is a fantastical, and fantastically expensive, effort to indefinitely prolong life for (let's face it) the wealthy be where we should be putting our money?
Of course, such considerations won't stop efforts to "cure death." Still, anyone hoping to live forever ought to contend with the prospect that plenty of scientists say the climate crisis might threaten civilization within a few decades - a prospect that would cut short certain people's planned multicentury retirement schemes.
"Immortality, Inc." is a valuable look at this particular playing field, but Mr. Walter might have taken a harder look at the implications of the game.

Texto completo: ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON, the United States Senate will begin, in earnest, the third impeachment trial of a US president in American history.
The outcome is largely a foregone conclusion. Republicans will almost certainly ignore President Trump's corruption and abuse of power and vote to acquit him, even as new evidence is emerging that removes any lingering doubt about his misconduct in office.
The latest revelations from former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas provide ample confirmation of the damning impeachment narrative laid out by House Democrats.
Freezing military assistance and trading a White House meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter were not one-off events. According to Parnas, Trump and Giuliani were obsessed with manufacturing dirt on Biden and these efforts went back months.
It should be noted at the outset that Parnas is a shady character who is under federal indictment. Still, much of what he is alleging is supported by documentation as well as other evidence unearthed by the House impeachment inquiry.
For example, in text conversations released by the House Intelligence Committee, Parnas and then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko refer to a heretofore unknown quid pro quo from the spring of 2019 — an offer by Lutsenko to trade damaging information on Biden in return for the firing of Marie Yovanovitch, the US Ambassador to Ukraine. Lutsenko had a long-running feud with Yovanovitch, who had accused his office of being stained by corruption.
To get rid of her, Lutsenko dangled anti-Biden dirt in front of the Trump team — and in late April, Yovanovitch was fired.
However, when Lutsenko failed to live up to his end of the bargain, Giuliani and Parnas looked elsewhere. In May, the New York Times revealed Giuliani's intention to fly to Kyiv looking for information on Biden. After an immediate backlash he canceled his plans. But Parnas still went. He met with a key Zelensky aide and on Giuliani's orders, he claims, delivered a stern message — play ball on the Biden investigation or Vice President Mike Pence, who had already accepted in invitation to Zelensky's inaugural, would not attend.
The Ukrainians refused. The morning after Parnas says he informed Giuliani of the news, the White House announced that Pence would not be traveling to Kyiv.
With efforts to pressure Zelensky fizzling, Giuliani sought other avenues. Parnas says there was discussion in May of a quid pro quo with Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash, who is jailed in Austria fighting extradition to the United States to face charges of bribery. Parnas says he and Giuliani agreed to help Firtash squash the extradition if he could deliver dirt on Biden. At Parnas's urging, the oligarch hired two well-connected conservative American attorneys, Joseph DiGenova and Victoria Toensing, to directly lobby Attorney General Bill Barr. Though they were able to get a meeting with Barr, that effort failed too.
It was at that point that Trump enlisted government officials to do his bidding. He instructed Gordon Sondland, US Ambassador to the European Union, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Kurt Volker, US Special Representative for Ukraine, to work with Giuliani on Ukraine issues. Not long after, he froze military assistance to Ukraine and then conditioned a White House visit for Zelensky on the announcement of a Biden inquiry.
None of this had anything to do with ferreting out corruption in Ukraine. It had everything to do with getting dirt on Biden.
The question now is not whether Trump committed a crime. It's whether Republicans intend to hold him accountable.
These newest revelations suggest that investigators have only scratched the surface of the Ukraine scandal. Questions about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine (which the Government Accountability Office said this week was illegal) have been unanswered. So too are questions about the involvement of Pence, Perry, Barr, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Testimony from each of these men, along with former National Security Adviser John Bolton and White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, could shed light on the depths of Trump's wrongdoing.
But Senate Republicans are clearly not interested in the truth. Barring four GOP senators remembering their oath of office to uphold the Constitution and joining Democrats to set reasonable rules for the trial, the Senate will conduct a sham proceeding, with no witnesses and no subpoenas. Trump will be acquitted and his crimes will go unpunished.
A corrupt president, who has already tried twice to involve a foreign government in subverting a US presidential election, will remain in office, confident in the knowledge that there's no power he can't abuse and no crime he can't commit with complete impunity. And the descent of American democracy into banana republicanism will be complete.

Texto completo: Filming this special episode of "The Weekly" required a strict set of rules -- and a plan to keep a secret.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
As two of the producers with "The Weekly," The New York Times's documentary TV series, we have experience filming presidential races and know how challenging it can be to obtain access to the candidates. If you're lucky, what you often get is just a few moments with contenders as they walk from stage to bus, forcing journalists to make a meal out of crumbs. But when The Times's editorial board gave us the green light to film its endorsement process for the first time, we knew this would be a feast.
The rules set by the board meant the candidates had to leave their lifelines at the door -- jettisoning all campaign staff members before facing the board alone for 90 minutes, an eternity in political journalism. For us, this meant the chance to film answers to personal questions like "Who has broken your heart?" which could lend insight into their motivations, priorities and personalities.
We were excited but also humbled by the responsibility and the stakes. Certainly, we didn't want our presence to muck up a significant interview with a could-be president, so discretion was critical. To avoid distracting the candidates, we deployed four cameras, each with a camera operator, in a 15th-floor boardroom at The Times, along with a stationary high-angle camera.
We converted another conference room into a control center. From there, our director of photography coordinated camera coverage over radio as the director, executives and producers of "The Weekly" monitored all five camera feeds, listening in on the 20 audio channels (the board members and the candidate all had their own mic), and taking notes that would be used later to inform choices in the edit rooms.
At the end of filming, we faced a challenge that comes with television production. The program would run 50 minutes in length, but we had recorded roughly 14 hours of candidate interviews and hours of the board's deliberations. Any documentary involves boiling scenes down to their essence, but in this case, we had the added weight of creating a historical record.
To meet that challenge, we huddled with a few members of the board after every interview, identifying the exchanges that felt most salient. Then we set strict rules for the editing: We would stick to chronology -- no question or answer could come earlier or later than it actually happened, and the exchanges would, of course, be edited to condense but never to alter their meaning. The portions that didn't make it in would be posted in their entirety online, along with annotated transcripts. (The Times also has published excerpts in a special section of today's print edition.)
A last hurdle we encountered had to do with protecting the secret -- the endorsement itself -- which would be revealed during the show. Kathleen Kingsbury, the deputy editorial page editor, takes the board's vote into consideration and presents her decision to the publisher. Ordinarily those two -- plus a handful of Opinion staff members tasked with drafting the endorsement -- are the only people in the world who know until the pick is published.
But television shows require a veritable army of creative, technical and administrative professionals to get the job done. To keep the secret secret, we created two versions of the episode and left the final scene out during any reviews, which meant that most of the crew -- and even some top executives -- would see the ending for the first time on air.
We'll remember the extensive access to the candidates for years to come, but to our surprise, one of the most satisfying parts of the process was watching the board members grapple with the same decision many voters are wrestling with now. Their sometimes heated debates laid bare that at the end of the day, the editorial board is not a monolithic entity that issues decrees from up high, but rather a group of regular people -- granted, very smart people -- whose everyday job is to sort through a messy world and apply a sense of clarity. We don't envy the task.

Ukraine's Leader Learns Going After Corruption Was a Lot Easier on TV

Texto completo: For Volodymyr Zelensky, taking on the oligarchs and organized crime is a domestic test with geopolitical consequences.
KYIV, Ukraine -- Kateryna Rozhkova, the first deputy governor of Ukraine's central bank, had just about learned to live with the hundreds of protesters banging metal rods and drums outside her office when they started gathering every morning outside her house.
If that wasn't enough, just before Christmas, a brass ensemble showed up at her home blaring funeral music in accompaniment of a horse-drawn hearse and men dressed like the grim reaper.
The protesters presented themselves as part of a grass roots effort opposing official corruption, but Ms. Rozhkova says they were anything but. She says they were sent by a billionaire accused of defrauding the government of $ 5 billion and who is now locked in a fierce battle with the Ukrainian central bank.
"If there is this kind of reaction," Ms. Rozhkova said of the lawlessness she says Ukraine's anti-corruption forces are up against, "it means that there is a fight."
President Volodymyr Zelensky, a comedian, sitcom star and political neophyte, catapulted to the presidency of Ukraine last spring on a promise of sweeping away the country's shadowy web of money and influence.
Now, as Mr. Zelensky faces pressure to deliver on his promises, he is finding that actually bringing the corrupt officials and oligarchs to heel is a lot harder than satirizing them on his former TV show, "Servant of the People."
Previous Ukrainian presidents came to power pledging to tackle corruption, but usually with the intent of using that pose as cover for their own corrupt deals, activists say. Whether Mr. Zelensky can show that he is different from past leaders will be a decisive litmus test for his presidency -- and for Ukraine's viability as a country moving closer to the West.
Further complicating an already daunting task, Mr. Zelensky has been forced to deal with the fallout from the Trump administration's pressure campaign in Ukraine and the impeachment trial in Washington that sprang from it.
In the past, Ukraine enjoyed the steadfast support of the United States in fighting both corruption and a war against Russian-backed separatists. Now, Ukrainians say Washington's message has grown muddled, in part because Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and his Ukrainian allies see the Western-backed camp of Ukrainian anticorruption reformers as their enemies.
"Giuliani flying in -- rather than fighting corruption, he was supporting and meeting with all of the past corrupt people," said Valeria Gontareva, the former head of Ukraine's central bank. "As a result, it's very hard to say what the message is that we now hear from America."
Nevertheless, anticorruption activists say they see signs of progress.
Mr. Zelensky's new prosecutor general is modernizing his corruption-plagued office and firing hundreds of prosecutors. A flurry of laws passed by Mr. Zelensky's months-old parliamentary majority seeks to overhaul the justice system and criminalize illicit enrichment by public officials. The president has even signed legislation establishing a procedure for his own impeachment.
When it comes to enforcing the law, however, Mr. Zelensky's tests are just beginning. Ukraine's mafia, for example, is trying to bribe and threaten members of Mr. Zelensky's ruling bloc in Parliament to derail legislation to crack down on organized crime, said a senior lawmaker, David Arakhamia.
"They meet them by their house and say, 'We know where your parents live,"' said Mr. Arakhamia, the floor leader of Mr. Zelensky's party in Parliament.
And just this week Mr. Zelensky's handpicked prime minister, Oleksiy Honcharuk, offered his resignation after the leak of what he said was a doctored recording on which he is heard to say the president has a "primitive" understanding of economics. Mr. Honcharuk blamed the leak on forces trying to undermine the anticorruption drive. Mr. Zelensky refused his resignation.
Perhaps Mr. Zelensky's biggest challenge lies with his erstwhile patron, Ihor Kolomoisky, one of the oligarchs that Mr. Giuliani and his associates courted and the man Ms. Rozhkova believes is responsible for trying to intimidate her and her colleagues.
Mr. Kolomoisky advanced Mr. Zelensky's career by putting "Servant of the People" on his TV channel. Now, having returned from self-imposed exile in Israel and Switzerland, he is hoping to regain control of a bank that the government seized from him, alleging that he and his business partner siphoned billions of dollars out of it.
"Even more than getting it back, I want to punish the guilty" responsible for seizing the bank, Mr. Kolomoisky told The New York Times in November. "The guilty must be put on the spike and the death penalty brought back for them."
In a recent phone interview, Mr. Kolomoisky denied having anything to do with the protests against the central bank, which have been covered extensively on the television channel he owns and populated by people transported in buses bearing the logo of one of his businesses. He called Mr. Giuliani an "honorable person."
Ms. Gontareva, who nationalized Mr. Kolomoisky's bank, PrivatBank, in 2016, says she got a sample of the oligarch's methods last year. First, she was hit by a car while in London, where she was living at the time. Then her house in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and her son's car were hit by arson attacks. She decided to remain in London in self-imposed exile.
Mr. Kolomoisky dismissed Ms. Gontareva's allegations, saying she "has to be sent to the insane asylum."
Mr. Zelensky needs to demonstrate to Ukraine's Western creditors that he is serious about prosecuting large-scale fraud in order to secure billions of dollars in sorely needed loans from the International Monetary Fund.
In the impeachment proceedings in Washington, Ukraine has been tarnished by corruption accusations by Republicans and Democrats alike -- feeding worries that Kyiv now faces a long-term challenge in winning bipartisan support even as its conflict with neighboring Russia continues.
In America, "politicians are an extension of the electorate, and the electorate has already concluded that Ukraine is a corrupt country," said Oleksandr Danylyuk, who resigned as Mr. Zelensky's national security adviser in September. "In practice, I expect the support of the United States to be minimal in the next year."
The new prosecutor general, Ruslan Ryaboshapka, this fall allowed a longstanding case to proceed against a different business tycoon, Oleg Bakhmatyuk, who is also accused of siphoning money from his bank. But the Ukrainian authorities have not brought such charges against Mr. Kolomoisky.
That has led to accusations that Mr. Zelensky is giving his media ally and former business partner special treatment -- charges that both men deny.
But high-profile corruption cases "won't be credible until there's action taken against Kolomoisky," said Mr. Danylyuk, the former Zelensky adviser. "Bakhmatyuk won't cut it."
Mr. Kolomoisky denies any wrongdoing in the PrivatBank matter. Mr. Bakhmatyuk also denies wrongdoing.
Ukraine's problems extend beyond Mr. Kolomoisky, however. The powerful S.B.U. intelligence agency remains in dire need of changes to stop it from intervening "in all areas of social life and business," says the Anti-Corruption Action Center, a watchdog group. Rather than functioning as a Western intelligence service, the S.B.U. is able to take advantage of its wide-ranging powers to extract bribes and exert undue influence across Ukraine, its critics say.
"Right now, corrupt elites from various agencies are trying to understand how to operate under the new political realities in Ukraine," said the center's executive director, Daria Kaleniuk. "They're looking for whom to bribe, who to negotiate with."
A representative of Andriy Bohdan, Mr. Zelensky's chief of staff whom Mr. Bakhmatyuk blamed for his plight, did not respond to a request for comment.
Dmytro Sologub, a deputy governor of the National Bank of Ukraine, said post-Soviet Ukraine was particularly vulnerable to corruption even compared to some other post-Communist European countries. Caught between warring European powers for centuries, the country has little legacy of its own trusted institutions.
"The system we're trying to change now was created and modified in the course of 25 years," Mr. Sologub said. "That raises the question of how much time will be necessary to change it."

Texto completo: A Life of Real Estate ... and Secrets
Readers responded by letter and at nytimes.com to Julie Satow's article last Sunday on the late Faith Hope Consolo, the real estate titan and gambler's daughter who created a fictional high-society childhood. Letters have been edited. Too bad she didn't realize that her true story was much more interesting and admirable than her fabrications. She had no advantages from birth and overcame adversity to survive and thrive. She should have felt proud, not ashamed. Perhaps she created this false persona to get important work earlier in her career and then had to keep the lie going. As a successful business person, she could have written a book about her real life. I think it would have been a best seller.
Georgia M, Canada
The New York Times often makes me feel that I should have gone into the business of scamming rich people. because the tolerance for foolishness, pretense and nonsense among the wealthy seems to be extremely high.
momalle3, Arlington, Va.
Such an interesting story and a quintessentially New York one, which must have taken a lot of research to unearth. Thanks for the effort and for sharing it. I don't quite know whether to feel happy or sad for her. She lived a rich full life but one filled with deception. Somehow she must have paid a price for that deception in continually feeling inauthentic and hollow -- or do some of us really manage to fully believe the images we create? And we all do but usually to a much lesser extent.
Woody, Houston
Cool. A hustler who hustled hustlers. I like her. Makes life interesting to know about a woman like this. Sure, I have better role models, kinder, more attuned to doing good deeds, blah blah blah. But I still like a good con; can't help it.
Marilyn, USA
I am dismayed by the number of apologists for Ms. Consolo's deceptions. No, everybody does not lie or fabricate their pasts. That so many commentators believe such behavior is justified or excusable indicates a lack of integrity. Honest, conscientious people who manage despite rough childhoods and who live their lives with respect for others deserve our praise, not those who lie to and deceive others.
RYSD
I met Faith in the mid-1980s, when I was running a small real estate development company with my younger brother. My initial reaction to her interest in us was puzzlement. We were small potatoes compared to the huge national companies she dealt with daily. I knew of her, and was familiar with her achievements in retail real estate. I asked my brother: "Do you think she'll really meet with us? Would such a relatively small commission interest her?" Not only did she work with us, but her level of interest in our business was astonishing. We did a number of successful deals together. And she was the absolutely consummate professional. Her energy was monumental. As far as these revelations are concerned, they amount to much ado about nothing. Any falsehoods described are minor and irrelevant to her professional life and work.
ALLEN ROTH, New York
She was the female equivalent of Don Draper, the protagonist of the television series "Mad Men." If we forgive his peccadilloes, surely we can forgive hers.
Duane Tom, Alameda, Calif.
This is a story that should be a Lifetime movie, as Ms. Consolo obviously conquered multiple odds to have the glamorous life so many young women aspire to. Perhaps Melissa McCarthy starring. I have close friends whose Facebook and LinkedIn profiles are vividly curated, posturing all sorts of peripatetic travel, professional achievements, "blessed" days, accolades, etc., when in reality their lives are peppered with boyfriends who won't commit, neglectful husbands, children who miserably disappoint them, and work situations that rival draconian coal mines.
As one of my more truthful friends indicates through his brilliant photography, every picture tells three stories: 1. the picture itself; 2. the picture we want to believe is true; 3. the picture others see. Rarely are all three in sync.
TurandotNeverSleeps, New York
I thought of Bette Midler for a serious movie. But your casting of Melissa McCarthy is perfect too. Maybe they can both do it at different ages. But not Lifetime. There's a more serious story here. A story Lee Remick could have played brilliantly.

Texto completo: The New York Times's editorial board has endorsed presidential candidates for more than a century. In support of Abraham Lincoln's candidacy, editors wrote: "Things will go on very much as they have hitherto -- except that we shall have honesty and manliness instead of meanness and corruption." More than 150 years later, Americans are facing a critical choice. Foreign conflicts are brewing, and impeachment proceedings are unfolding at home. Citizens have the responsibility -- constitutionally enshrined, more urgent than ever -- to steer the nation's course at the ballot box. Many candidates are vying for the Democratic Party's nomination. Each offers a particular vision of the country's future, and a different set of strengths and solutions to realize that vision. ¶ The board's endorsement process is an opportunity to ask hard questions and engage candidates in the kind of prolonged back-and-forth that reveals insights that don't often emerge in debates or in campaign appearances. These illuminating interviews have historically happened behind closed doors. This year, the Times board experimented with a new level of openness. All interviews were conducted on the record. ¶ We hope this endorsement process will give readers -- and voters -- a new understanding of the key issues facing the nation and shaping the 2020 presidential race.

Sunrise Salutations
I work in a high school where two teachers receive a stipend for supervising the entrance at the beginning of the day. Both teachers sit behind a table facing the entrance, by which all teachers and students must pass, but they never say hello to the students or staff. If I say hello they sometimes respond, but other times nothing. I have stopped saying "good morning" but find it terribly uncomfortable to walk past in silence. Other times of day these same teachers try to engage in conversation, but I harbor resentment from the morning. Shouldn't greeters say hello?
-- New Jersey
The single best thing about leaving high school is abandoning the requirement to be anywhere by 7:45 a.m. I'm trying to summon a memory from the start of any first-period class. All I can come up with are recollections of signing in late at the security desk, which suggests either that I was tardy every day (possible) or that my brain is unable to form lasting memories before 8 a.m. I don't know what time your school starts, but it's definitely too early. Your co-workers get there even earlier.
Yes, it would be nice if everyone trudging into school received a personal country club welcome. You are clearly passionate about this issue; consider arriving at work early to greet crowds the way they deserve, pro bono.
People other than United States ambassadors to Western European nations are generally not paid to relax and have fun, yet a portion of the school's budget was allocated as compensation for arrival supervision. Perhaps this was the only way to ensure people would show up and do it. It would be grim to speculate about why administrators feel that dedicated staff members must monitor the ingress of every person on school property. (I imagine students would prefer to slip by unnoticed to conceal flagrant dress code violations.) You give no indication that the teachers are frequently absent or otherwise preoccupied. It sounds like they are ably performing their assigned task: "supervising the entrance."
A few possible explanations for why they might not greet you: They are scanning the perimeter for interlopers. They are not early birds. They recall past attempts to engage you in conversation that found you standoffish, owing to your secret tendency to "harbor resentment from the morning."
The best way to make a friend is to be a friend, and the best way to force someone to say hello to you is to make eye contact and offer a clear, bright "Hello!" every morning until you break them. Let's be gentle with one another before 10 a.m.
Fan Mail
I read your column online and always seem to draw a comparison to Hustler magazine's Forum because so many of the letters seem contrived. Then I think about their content, and I realize the writers must be either extremely insecure or just plain indecisive. Doesn't make me feel better, but reminds me I have just wasted a few minutes that I will never recover. We are in grave danger if any of them are allowed to vote or procreate.

The internet has brought a lot of good to the world, such as the highly revered Work Friend column, but it has also facilitated the spread of incorrect information and lackluster opinions on which even holders' grasps are tenuous. Forum was a Penthouse feature. Please click here.
Primal Screen Therapy
Our team had a meeting with another team requiring a screen share from my laptop. As the meeting ended and everyone "hung up," my manager, who was unable to attend, messaged me to ask how it went. I was unaware that our messaging was not the private conversation I thought it was; other people were reading our messages because they hadn't closed out their screens.
None of what we said was unprofessional or untrue, but a woman who can be difficult did a screenshot of the messages and sent it to my boss's boss, who had been on the call. I am really upset about this invasion of privacy, lack of respect and questionable ethical judgment.
I want to address this situation, as I feel violated and wronged. This person needs to have consequences, in my opinion; she is a V.P. and should know better. I don't know her well and will see her in person at a large-ish meeting in two weeks. I don't really want to call her myself, and I feel like H.R. should do something, but all of this just furthers the friction, even though she's bringing it on herself.
1) Shouldn't this person have closed her screen and/or let me know that my screen was still open? 2) What the $ &@? Sending the screen to my boss's boss -- what could she hope to achieve with that?!
-- Anonymous
1) Yes, that is the professional, polite and kind thing to do, but not the most strategic, entertaining or delicious thing to do, which is why many people would not do it.
2) A good guess about what she hoped to achieve: everything from your worst nightmares -- making you and your manager look careless, disagreeable, technologically inept, etc.
It certainly sounds like a lot of difficult people work in your office, but without my knowing your boss's boss, it's tough to determine how close your co-worker might have come to achieving her goal. That some people detest tattletales and that the leaked conversation does not sound explosive are points in your favor. I am curious who alerted you to the existence of the screenshot. If it was your boss's boss, you have a powerful ally (good) who loves drama (chaotic).
As an ever-increasing amount of office communication takes place in digital environments offering the appearance but not guarantee of privacy for participants, it is crucial to shed the presumption that these conversations are secret. At a minimum, don't send anything over a work platform -- be it instant messenger, email or chat room -- you wouldn't feel comfortable hearing read aloud by opposing counsel. (I say this as someone with brief cameos in the internal chat transcripts of a former employer that were entered into evidence in a Florida court.) Even better: Don't transmit anything you couldn't say at a normal volume in a restaurant across the street from your office.
From the comprehensive way you enumerate your co-worker's failures of judgment, and the resulting negative impacts on your emotions, I suspect you are experienced in the alchemy of transforming your complaints into others' punishment. It is for your own office reputation that I say: This is not an H.R. issue. Your computer was not hacked.
The good news is, this will never happen to you again, because you will be paranoid about it for the rest of your life.

Texto completo: The president weighed in before thousands were expected to gather in Virginia's capital for a gun rights rally.
RICHMOND, Va. -- Days before a planned gun rights rally that has set Virginia's capital on edge, President Trump warned that state Democrats were threatening Americans' right to bear arms.
"Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia," Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Friday. "That's what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!"
The state legislature, where Democrats recently took control for the first time in a generation, is considering several gun control bills, including measures that would require background checks for people purchasing firearms and give municipalities the authority to ban weapons in public buildings.
Thousands of people are expected to descend on the Capitol in Richmond on Monday to protest those measures, in a state where hunting is popular and gun ownership is common in rural areas. Several men with ties to right-wing militias who had planned to attend the rally have been arrested in recent days.
On Saturday, the area around the State Capitol was enclosed by a temporary chain-link fence, barricades and patrolled by groups of law enforcement officers.
Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency and banned firearms and other weapons on the Capitol grounds this week, further inflaming gun rights activists. The order was challenged in court by the rally's organizers, the Virginia Citizens Defense League. On Friday evening, the State Supreme Court upheld the ban.
Mr. Trump's position on gun rights has been difficult to pin down during his time in office. He supported "meaningful background checks" in the weeks after deadly mass shootings in Texas and Ohio last year, but later walked back that support after meeting with gun rights activists, including the president of the National Rifle Association.
That turnabout mirrored the president's shift after the 2018 shooting in Parkland, Fla., when he expressed support for stronger gun controls and then backtracked after speaking with N.R.A. officials.
In Virginia, Mr. Northam released a statement on Friday saying that the vast majority of those planning to attend the rally on Monday had no interest in creating disturbances, but that some were bent on stoking violence.
"Over the past few days, the news has confirmed that this rally is attracting extreme individuals and groups -- including national hate, neo-Nazi, and white supremacist groups -- who are threatening violence and looking to advance a violent agenda."

His Death Rattled World And Shook His U.S. City

Texto completo: The Sacramento region is home to thousands of Muslim immigrants. The death of one of them in Iraq was the spark that brought the United States and Iran to the edge of war.
SACRAMENTO -- The body of the man whose death, 7,000 miles away in Iraq, unleashed a geopolitical crisis lies in an unmarked grave below a mound of moist earth, on plot E-233 at the Greater Sacramento Muslim Cemetery. His grieving widow remains behind closed doors.
It has been almost three weeks since Nawres Waleed Hamid, a naturalized citizen who grew up in Iraq, became the latest American to die in the United States' nearly two-decade-long military entanglement in the Middle East. His death in a rocket attack in December in Kirkuk, where he was working as a translator for the American military, was quickly seized upon by President Trump, touching off a chain of events that for several days set the world on edge.
An Iran-backed militia was blamed for Mr. Hamid's death, and President Trump responded by ordering the killing of a prominent Iranian general, prompting retaliatory missile strikes by Iran against American troops inside Iraq.
Though tensions between Iran and the United States may have lessened since that moment when the two nations edged close to war, in Sacramento a sense of unease remains.
Citing Mr. Hamid's death as a reason for military action against Iran -- calling him an "American contractor" without mentioning that he was an immigrant -- made the president's posture especially stinging to some Muslims here, who have felt marginalized and vulnerable in recent years as the Trump administration has clamped down on immigration.
"That an Iraqi American Muslim immigrant was used as a pretext for military action in the Middle East is ironic," said Basim Elkarra, the executive director of the Sacramento chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. "It was shocking."
Like Mr. Elkarra, many people in Sacramento's sizable Muslim community are angry over Mr. Hamid's death, but have mostly chosen to keep their outrage private. Partly, that is because Mr. Hamid kept a low profile, with one foot in the United States and one in Iraq, and few people in the Sacramento area knew him personally. Mr. Hamid studied in California to become an American citizen yet returned to Iraq to work -- something he kept silent about with his circle of acquaintances.
Still, the reticence and angst offer a glimpse into how many people in Sacramento are wary of attracting attention because of their ties to the Middle East and fears over racist attitudes toward Arab immigrants.
Even for a United States citizen like Mr. Hamid, for example, going to work for the American military in Iraq can be as controversial as it is lucrative, and not something to showcase. In Iraq, Iraqis who work for the American military have long been targeted as traitors by anti-American militias, and have sometimes been killed. Even in Sacramento, going back home to work can be difficult: Iraqis in the city may be proud American citizens, but many are still critical of American policy in Iraq, blaming the United States for the violence and destruction of their homeland.
"You could be a translator at a time of peace for the U.S. embassy in Switzerland, and there would be no issue," said Mounir Kaddoura, an American of Palestinian heritage who runs the funeral home in Sacramento that prepared Mr. Hamid's body for burial.
Mr. Kaddoura said the Muslim immigrants he knows love America but are tired of endless wars in the Middle East and want American forces out of the region.
"But God forbid, if someone was attacking California, I'd grab a gun and fight," he said.
Many in Sacramento are reluctant to even discuss Mr. Hamid's death, for fear of retribution against relatives in Iraq, where armed groups are known to monitor digital media.
"People are afraid to comment online about the political situation because it can affect their families back home," Mr. Elkarra said.
The Sacramento Valley is home to some 75,000 Muslims, according to Mr. Elkarra, including thousands of Iraqis and Afghans who fled wars. There are more than 20 mosques in the region, serving different sects and ethnicities, as well as countless cafes, restaurants and grocery stores that cater to Middle Eastern immigrants. One such place is the Babylon City Market, a deli and grocery store whose shelves are stocked with dates and Middle Eastern candies and where workers bake diamond-shaped bread, common in the bakeries of Baghdad.
The store is Iraqi-American-owned, but manning the cash register was a young Afghan immigrant. The manager, Ahmed Adnan, moved to Sacramento when he was 9, a few years after the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. He said he felt unconnected to the mayhem in his homeland because he was so young when he left.
"I've not been through the misery," he said.
The number of new arrivals has dwindled substantially during Mr. Trump's presidency, and the possibilities for family members back home to join their relatives in America have been curtailed.
"It's not openly discussed, but everyone knows he's a racist, and against Muslims and asylum seekers," said Sajad Janmohamed, a retired doctor who runs the Muslim cemetery in Sacramento, in reference to Mr. Trump. "It's so cruel. Jesus was an asylum seeker."
Mr. Janmohamed hastily arranged for Mr. Hamid's funeral on Jan. 4 after Mr. Hamid's body arrived from Iraq. On the morning of the funeral, a message went out on a WhatsApp group that many area Muslims belong to, asking for attendees.
"He was the only person I knew here," Noor Al-Khalil, Mr. Hamid's widow, said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee, which first reported his burial. "It still doesn't feel real. It has been difficult to accept that he is no longer here."
The exact circumstances of Mr. Hamid's death on Dec. 27 are still mysterious. Mrs. Khalil said that he had stopped responding to her telephone messages, and then a representative from his employer appeared on her doorstep bearing the grim news.
The company, Valiant Integrated Services, issued a brief public statement, calling the death tragic and describing Mr. Hamid as a consummate professional who was "cherished and valued by his colleagues."
Angela Pruitt, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to provide any further details about Mr. Hamid's work.
He was the second interpreter working for the company to be killed in the Middle East in 2019. Ghadir Taher, a 27-year-old Syrian-American from East Point, Ga., died in a suicide bombing in Manbij, Syria, last January.
The company paid for Mr. Hamid's burial, The Bee reported.
Mr. Hamid studied computer science at American River College, a community college near Sacramento, between 2013 and 2018 but did not graduate, according to Scott Crow, the spokesman for the college.
Mrs. Khalil, a medical technician, declined to be interviewed by The New York Times.
She said in the interview with The Bee that the couple had two sons, aged 8 and 2. She was pregnant with the first when the couple arrived in the United States in 2011, she told the paper, and her husband was naturalized in 2017.
For the moment, she said, she plans to stay in their adopted homeland to raise her children.
"What would I return to in Iraq?" she was quoted as saying.
At the quiet funeral, Mr. Janmohamed was struck by how few friends of Mr. Hamid's were in attendance, and by the empty stare of his wife. "It was almost like she wasn't there," he said.
To make the funeral arrangements, Mr. Janmohamed dealt with a Virginia man who said he was a friend of Mr. Hamid's and had worked with him in Iraq, but offered no other details about the manner of Mr. Hamid's death or the work he did in Iraq. The man insisted that he remain anonymous, especially to the press.
"He said, 'Don't give my name to anybody,"' Mr. Janmohamed said.

Texto completo: Bad news used to spook the markets. Now it seems to lift them. How weird is that?
You might not have noticed, but financial markets have gone kind of nuts.
They don't seem to be following the old rules that governed stocks and other investments in the past. Generally, bad news drove stocks down. Small investors like me (and they don't get much smaller) would get nervous whenever confidence-rattling news like a trade conflict popped up.
Whether or not you sell stocks when you receive bad tidings, the sense that there's a relationship between rotten news and market dives gives the comforting feeling that you just might understand economics, at least a little.
But today's rising stock market seems to defy gravity. Nothing really slows it down for long, at least so far: not trade wars, domestic political deadlock and strife, international tensions or, of course, the increasingly obvious disaster of climate change.
I'm not claiming that we've done away with the business cycle of booms and busts. Supposedly smart people made that claim in the 1990s and in 2000, during the dot-com boom. Technological innovation had helped create a New Economy that would leave the business cycle in the dustbin of economic history, or something like that.
The arguments sounded almost plausible until things went south. By 2001, we were in a recession, and even before that decline, markets faltered. Turns out that all that talk of transcending business cycles was a bad case of irrational exuberance, as the economist and Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan memorably put it.
By the mid-2000s, things were humming along again, and the real estate market was doing very, very well -- though some sourpusses warned that things were getting a little, you know, exuberant. Nobody loves a naysayer, though, and a prominent economic commentator named Larry Kudlow criticized what he called "the bubbleheads who expect housing-price crashes in Las Vegas or Naples, Florida, to bring down the consumer, the rest of the economy, and the entire stock market."
Despite rosy proclamations like that, we know what happened next: That bubble, too, burst, and the Great Recession sent the economy into the doldrums for years.
What happened to the economist who so confidently talked about the bubbleheads? Let me Google here for a sec. Kudlow. Whatever happened to that guy, anyway?
Oh. He now advises the president. On economics.
Well, whatever others may say, I'm not here to tell you that we've abolished the business cycle. Instead, I've got a theory: The world has gone topsy-turvy. As Cole Porter put it in the song "Anything Goes":
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today,
And black's white today,
And day's night today ...
Could it be that the markets have actually decided that bad news is good? Is it possible that events and ideas that once would have sent markets into a downward spiral are somehow lofting them ever higher? And if so, should investors be perversely hoping for even more bad news?
How would I even test this hypothesis? Maybe by inviting disaster: I could stop flossing! Take up smoking again! Busk naked in the subway!
No, bad as those things would be, we need something that afflicts all of society. Maybe we can have more tariffs. After all, trade wars are good, and easy to win. We can make the government totally dysfunctional! Impeachment? (A mixed bag, that one: To some, it's good news.) Or maybe even hope for another war? Maybe with Iran? Leading to World War III?
Hmm. Maybe my thesis is being tested, after all. But these aren't things I want to see, so I'll stick with middling misfortune. Still, there might be other ways to validate my theory.
I called a certified smart person to find out if my theory is brilliant: N. Gregory Mankiw, an economist at Harvard University.
From 2003 to 2005, during the George W. Bush administration, he was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. He's also an economic hero of mine for a 2007 paper he wrote that suggested we should tax tall people at a higher rate than short people. As a short person, I found that this argument made economics come alive for me. (Unfortunately, Greg didn't really mean it; he was making a point about things we should and should not fairly tax.)
He also writes occasionally for The New York Times, but I can't count that as a credential for his expertise. After all, I write for The Times. I rest my case.
The first thing he wanted me to understand was that markets have actually been taking some of the bad news into account but are buoyed by other factors. "The news has been mixed," he said. "The trade war stuff has been bad for the markets, but the tax cut stuff has been good for the markets." The economy has continued to grow, and unemployment has somehow reached historically low levels without setting off inflation. "That's a bit of a puzzle," he admitted.
"If there's one big thing I would emphasize, it's how little economists know," he said. "We are really, really bad at predicting."
That lack of forecasting ability should not be so surprising, he said; it's not confined to economists. Mathematicians know an awful lot about numbers, he said, but "you wouldn't ask them what's the next winning Lotto number." And, he added, "the inherent unpredictability is not going to go away."
This was fascinating -- who doesn't love a conversation about macroeconomics? But it still wasn't helping me understand whether I was about to revolutionize economic theory with the Schwartz curve, which posits an inverse relationship between good news and good market returns. Or something like that.
As improbable as it sounds, was my idea NOT brilliant? Even, perhaps, stupid? I've been called an idiot before. More often than you might think! I can take it.
He chose his words carefully. "I would never call anybody stupid," he said, "but I would say that the idea is probably not brilliant."
He explained, "It almost never makes sense to say, 'This is a good time to buy, or this is a good time to sell, because we literally never, ever, ever know." That's the folly of day trading, he said: Trying to time the market is a game almost nobody wins. Buy and hold, he said, "is the right way to go."
Greg was no fun. But he wasn't wrong. I don't actually buy and sell individual stocks myself. Like most investors, my savings are largely parked in low-fee index funds. I'm chicken.
On the other hand, it's a relief to know that I don't have to be out there wishing for disasters to get rich. Writing about climate change, as I do in my day job, is already disastrous enough for me.

Texto completo: President Trump claims Nancy Pelosi has intentionally undermined Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign by delaying the impeachment trial. Mr. Sanders denounced that theory on Friday.
WASHINGTON -- The first version of the conspiracy theory was hatched on Twitter last Friday, Jan. 10.
"Don't rule out that the reason Pelosi hasn't sent impeachment to the Senate is to hurt Warren and Sanders, and to help Biden," Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, tapped out on his iPad. "By timing the trial so it takes place during the Iowa lead-up, she has leverage over the liberals."
Mr. Fleischer's message was retweeted 1,400 times.
Seven days later, Mr. Fleischer's theory that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attempting to influence the Democratic primary -- for which there is no evidence -- was being promulgated by President Trump.
"They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously," Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday, claiming his Senate trial was designed to keep Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Des Moines ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.
"Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again," the president added.
An idea that caught fire on Twitter and became grist for Mr. Trump demonstrates how the same echo chamber of right-wing media that boosted him in 2016 is exerting its power again just before the first primary votes are cast in 2020.
There was nothing new in terms of the process that got the idea in front of Mr. Trump. But the evolution from online conspiracy theory to Fox News fodder to presidential talking point demonstrated how a world of conservative influencers, Republican lawmakers and online media outlets can drive disinformation through repetition and amplification.
Two days after Mr. Fleischer's tweet, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, appeared on Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox News and repeated it. "This is the dirty little secret nobody is talking about: why the Speaker held these papers," Mr. McCarthy said on Sunday. "This benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee."
In fact, Mr. Sanders is not the national front-runner for the nomination and never has been, although he had a narrow lead in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. But Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders, viewing the self-described democratic socialist as the president's ideal Democratic opponent in November.
The Trump camp, in turn, is worried about Mr. Biden's competitiveness against the president in Midwestern battleground states, and would like to do anything possible to trip up the moderate former vice president in his tight primary race against the liberal Mr. Sanders.
Mr. McCarthy has continued to repeat the theory and profess support for Mr. Sanders, repeating the talking points in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. His television commentary was then written up by Breitbart News, the right-wing news and opinion site.
On Thursday, The Federalist, a conservative website, ran an article with the headline: "Is Impeachment Delay How Democrats Are Rigging Iowa Against Bernie Again?" It said Ms. Pelosi's decision to delay impeachment "provokes the question whether she is deliberately helping Joe Biden."
One day later, the message had reached the White House, where Mr. Trump, a frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, presented the idea as a fact.
"It's easy to see why Bernie and his supporters would think the establishment is screwing them again," said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, noting that the campaign often looks to Mr. Trump's Twitter feed for its daily message.
Conspiracies surrounding Mr. Sanders's political fortunes have been a particular fixation for Mr. Trump, dating back four years. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump circulated the false and unsourced claim that an "analysis" -- he did not say who wrote it or where it was published -- concluded that Mr. Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if not for superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who were not bound to vote for the winner of their states' primaries or caucuses.
At the time, Mr. Trump and his advisers realized the potential political benefit in lobbing these kinds of accusations. Their campaign, which relied heavily on depressing Democratic turnout as a way to win battleground states like Florida and Michigan, stood to gain by fanning the flames of the rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and dredging up the bitterness that many Sanders supporters felt over their loss.
Even after winning the election, Mr. Trump continued to claim that Mrs. Clinton had somehow robbed Mr. Sanders of victory. When Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, released a memoir in 2017, Mr. Trump inaccurately said the book showed that Mrs. Clinton "bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary" from Mr. Sanders.
In an interview, Mr. Fleischer said he had not seen the idea about the timing of the impeachment trial anywhere else and had not consulted with anyone when he first pitched it on Twitter. "I just do my best to realistically assess what's happening in Washington," he said. Mr. Fleischer said he believed that Ms. Pelosi does not think Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November, and that "she has one big thing on her mind: that's winning the White House."
He said his tweet took off because "if it has merit, it starts to gather momentum."
"If it has no merit, it's just another tweet," he added.
Republican staff members on Capitol Hill said the theory gained traction because of a broader narrative -- pushed by Mr. Sanders's own supporters -- that Mr. Sanders was generally getting a raw deal from the mainstream news media and other candidates in the race.
In a statement on Friday, in response to a question from The New York Times about the president's conspiracy tweet, Mr. Sanders denounced the theories. "Let's be clear about who is rigging what: It is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial," he said. "His transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November."
Ms. Pelosi's team has also made it clear she was not trying to meddle in the nominating process.
"Impeachment has nothing to do with politics or the presidential race," a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter this week, responding to Mr. McCarthy's accusation. "As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about."
On Friday, he added: "Regardless, Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense."

Texto completo: Joe Bryan has maintained his innocence since his sentencing for the 1985 murder. The highest criminal court in Texas this week denied a last-ditch effort to obtain a new trial.
In the decades since he was convicted of murdering his wife, Mickey Bryan, in 1985, Joe Bryan has maintained his innocence.
As Mr. Bryan aged behind bars -- he is now 79 and suffers from congestive heart failure -- the case attracted intense scrutiny. Key evidence has been questioned, and one man who delivered expert testimony on the blood splatter in the room where Ms. Bryan was killed -- a pivotal moment in Mr. Bryan's 1986 trial -- has conceded that some of his conclusions at the time were wrong.
Despite two appeals, one retrial and several attempts to make parole, Mr. Bryan's 99-year sentence stands. And on Wednesday, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the highest criminal court in the state, denied his application for a writ of habeas corpus.
The writ was something of a last-ditch effort to appeal the case. Now, Mr. Bryan's options to have his conviction overturned are significantly limited.
His lawyer, Jessica Freud, said the court's decision came down without an explanation. "This is absolutely disappointing and makes our options limited," she said in an interview on Thursday. "We're going to keep trying."
The Bosque County District Attorney's Office, which prosecuted the case, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday.
Mr. Bryan's case is often held up as a warning about bloodstain-pattern analysis, a forensic discipline that is increasingly considered unreliable and misleading, especially given the scant scientific training that many investigators receive before applying it.
Lynn Robitaille Garcia, the general counsel of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, said Mr. Bryan's case had a significant role in inspiring the state to develop a new licensing program for analysts doing crime scene reconstruction.
"Everyone now recognizes that was unsupportable work, including the expert himself," she said in an interview Thursday.
Obtaining a new trial requires more than proving that expert testimony relied on faulty science, however. "You have to show they wouldn't have been convicted if jurors knew this information," Ms. Garcia said. "That's not easy."
Ms. Bryan, a fourth-grade teacher, was found in her bedroom with four gunshot wounds on Oct. 15, 1985, in Clifton, Texas. She initially appeared to have been the victim of a burglary-turned-homicide. Mr. Bryan, a school principal, had been attending an education conference about 120 miles away in Austin at the time of the killing.
Sometime after Mr. Bryan returned from Austin, he let Ms. Bryan's older brother, Charlie Blue, use his vehicle. Mr. Blue would later tell the authorities that when he opened the trunk, he found a flashlight with what appeared to be bloodstains on the lens.
It was among a series of details that led the authorities to focus more on Mr. Bryan; they arrested him eight days after his wife was found dead. And as lawyers squared off in the State of Texas v. Joe D. Bryan, the stains on the flashlight and in the bedroom appeared to help the prosecutors substantially.
They called Robert Thorman, a police detective who was trained in bloodstain-pattern analysis, as an expert witness. Pointing to the patterns of blood as evidence, Mr. Thorman tied the strands of the case together in a narrative that involved Mr. Bryan driving from Austin to Clifton, shooting his wife at close range, changing his clothes and driving back to the conference.
But in the years since, many key pieces of evidence, including the blood-splatter analysis methods used by Mr. Thorman, have come under suspicion. The case was investigated extensively by Leon Smith, a longtime reporter and newspaper editor in Texas, and other journalists.
And it was the subject of a two-part investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times Magazine in May 2018.

In July 2018, the Texas Forensic Science Commission -- a nationally influential organization that investigates complaints about forensic evidence -- said that the blood-spatter analysis used to convict Mr. Bryan was not supported by science.
In a September 2018 affidavit, Mr. Thorman said that there had been faults with his methodology in the case and that some of his testimony "was not correct."
And in October 2018, the forensic science commission found that a Texas Department of Public Safety crime lab chemist had "exceeded her expertise and engaged in speculation" when she testified in 1989.
Barbara O'Brien, a professor at the Michigan State University College of Law, said that Mr. Bryan's case illustrated just how difficult it can be to persuade judges to revisit factual matters -- even when they are later shown to be false.
"Some would argue it's a big flaw in our system," she said. In general, judges "don't want to go back," she said.
Peter De Forest, a forensic scientist and professor emeritus at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said he believed that part of the issue with bloodstain-pattern analysis cases is that there are no clear guidelines about what is scientifically valid.
"It's disgusting, really," he said. "Judges are not in positions to be arbiters of what's good science."
As a field, Dr. De Forest said, bloodstain-pattern analysis still has the potential to be informative, but only when practiced correctly by those with adequate scientific education.
Part of the reason that bloodstain patterns are so prone to mislead, according to a 2009 report from the National Research Council on improving forensic science, is that complex patterns may appear deceptively simple.
The writ of habeas corpus denied on Wednesday included references to modern critiques of the bloodstain-analysis methods used in the case, new DNA evidence that could help Mr. Bryan and evidence pointing to another murder suspect, according to Ms. Freud, his lawyer. The response she received was a single sentence.
Mr. Bryan's options are now limited. One hope is for parole, Ms. Freud said. Her client has previously been denied parole seven times.

Texto completo: Barry Tuckwell, an Australian virtuoso of the French horn whose mastery over his fiendishly difficult instrument brought him international renown as the preeminent hornist of his era, died Jan. 16 at a hospital in Melbourne. He was 88.
The cause was complications from heart disease, according to his wife, Jenny Darling.
Mr. Tuckwell grew up in a musical home " his father, an organist, manned the hulking Wurlitzer at the local movie theater " but he showed only moderate musical promise during his early years playing the piano, violin and organ.
Only at 13, when he first picked up a French horn, did his prodigious talent shine through. Mr. Tuckwell was still in his teens when he began playing professionally with orchestras in Australia. He was 24 when, in 1955, he became principal horn player with the London Symphony Orchestra, a post he held for 13 years.
Thus began a musical career that would take him around the world over half a century. In 1968, Mr. Tuckwell left the London symphony to strike out on his own, becoming one of the vanishingly few horn players to establish solo performing and recording careers. He was widely described as the most recorded hornist in history.
A case of 'right arm disease' " his jesting term for the lure of the conductor's podium " led him to pursue conducting opportunities, as well, and in 1982, he became founding music director of the Maryland Symphony Orchestra in Hagerstown. Mr. Tuckwell retired from performing in 1997 and left his post in Maryland the following year, eventually returning to his native Australia.
The French horn (more properly called the horn, according to many enthusiasts) is formed from 20 feet of coiled brass tubing that opens into a flared bell. A descendant of the hunting horn, it is capable of producing rousing fanfares as well as musical lines of sublime delicacy, but only in the hands of the most skilled musician.
The embouchure, or position of lips and mouth, necessary to coax musical notes from the horn's twisted metal is notoriously tricky. Mr. Tuckwell compared playing the horn to 'driving a Daimler at top speed on a slick road' " even the slightest mistake could have disastrous consequences " and likened the experience of making music on one to 'posting a letter.'
'You put [air] in there, and God knows what happens to it on the way,' he once said in an interview with the television program 'CBS This Morning.' 'With a bit of luck,' he added, the air reaches the other end of the instrument as music.
By all accounts, Mr. Tuckwell had more than a bit of luck. A German music critic, once cited by the London Independent, observed of a Tuckwell performance that 'if the hunter had played like this, the deer would have died from ecstasy.'
Mr. Tuckwell became the leading interpreter of the small but exquisite repertoire for French horn. It includes four concertos by Mozart, which Mr. Tuckwell recorded several times over, two by Richard Strauss, and works by composers as disparate as Cherubini, Bruckner, Brahms, Ravel and Shostakovich. Contemporary composers including Oliver Knussen, Richard Rodney Bennett, Thea Musgrave and Robin Holloway wrote works for him.
Mr. Tuckwell 'almost never misses a note,' the music critic Winthrop Sargeant wrote in the New Yorker magazine in 1977. 'His agility might be compared to that of a coloratura soprano. His tone is rich, and variously colored and shaded. His legato exhibits a singing line and a faultless feeling for accent and phrasing. His staccato attacks, made with the help of the tongue, are firm, and where desired remarkably rapid, and his articulation has enormous variety.
'All these qualities have caused him to be called, with some justice, the Jascha Heifetz of the horn,' Sargeant continued, referring to the celebrated violinist.
Barry Emmanuel Tuckwell was born in Prahran, a suburb of Melbourne, on March 5, 1931, to a family of Welsh origin. His mother played the piano. His sister, Patricia, played the violin and later married George Lascelles, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and an internationally known authority on the opera.
Mr. Tuckwell said that he could read music before he could read books but that he did not seem destined for a life in music before he tried the horn.
'I really wasn't any good at them,' he recalled of his early experimentation on the piano, violin and organ. 'One day somebody said, 'Look, he's musical, he must be able to play something. Try this.' And it was a French horn, and it was something I could do. So I was very lucky.'
He said he drew inspiration from the musicianship of American jazz trombonist Tommy Dorsey, whose recordings he studied avidly. In 1950, after performing with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and later the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Tuckwell moved to England, where his appointments came to include a teaching position at the Royal Academy of Music in London.
Mr. Tuckwell led the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra in Australia before founding his ensemble in Hagerstown, a small city in western Maryland. He had been drawn to the area by Walter A. Lawson, a widely admired French horn maker who lived in nearby Boonsboro.
'I didn't know there were this many tuxedos in Hagerstown,' one attendee quipped to The Washington Post when the Maryland Symphony Orchestra debuted in 1982.
On Mr. Tuckwell's retirement, Lawson, who died in 2007, told the New York Times that his friend had 'taken an orchestra that played really simple stuff, a sort of civic symphony, and made it into one that can perform Mahler's First Symphony and Shostakovich's Fifth very well.'
'He's a real conductor,' Lawson said. 'He has left his imprint here, and the town loves him.' Mr. Tuckwell lived for a period in Hagerstown and became a U.S. citizen before returning to Australia.
His marriages to Sally Newton, Hilary Warburton and Sue Elliott ended in divorce.
He and Darling, companions of 14 years, were married last year. In addition to his wife, of Melbourne, survivors include two children from his first marriage, David Tuckwell of London and Jane Tuckwell of Bromham, in Wiltshire, England; and a son from his second marriage, Tom Shahani-Tuckwell of London.
Reflecting on the difficulty of his instrument, Mr. Tuckwell told the Independent that 'horn-players have evolved a kind of freemasonry over the years " a fierce sense of loyalty. If someone is having a bad night, the others will do what they can to cover him. Because nobody, but nobody, else really understands our problems.'
But he also reported moments of transcendence. In one of the final performances of his career, he played a horn concerto by composer Reinhold Glière and told the Baltimore Sun that he 'was very pleased with it.'
'It was one of those evenings,' he remarked, 'where you say to yourself, 'I finally did something worthwhile.' '

Texto completo: Religion scholar on Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness brand
With a new Netflix series debuting this coming week, Gwyneth Paltrow's posh wellness brand, Goop, is once again commanding headlines. Public health experts, weary from debunking coffee enemas and vaginal steaming, are gearing up for a new flood of conveniently-streamed Goop -y pseudoscience, which, judging from the psychic mediums and energy healing in the show's trailer, has not been tempered for a broader audience.-
Lost in the haze of mugwort steam, however, is an entirely different problem with Goop, which is religious, not scientific. Ultimately what Goop promises is purity: physical, moral and spiritual. Peruse its website, and you'll soon learn that the life of a normal person is profoundly impure. Conventional food, clothing, perfume, cosmetics " all toxic to our bodies, our children and the planet. Filled with fear, the reader wonders: What is the key to living a pure life? How can I avoid defiling myself and the world?
The answer, crucial to Goop's business model, is to spend lots of money. Unlike regular luxury products, Goop's detoxes, cosmetics, crystals and clothing are packaged in 'ancient wisdom' and easy altruism. No need to fret about the carbon footprints left by your imported Italian leather boots or your Goop-curated winter ski getaway: Paltrow's savvy priesthood sells indulgences that wash away those sins.-Purchases, like high-end prayers, bring the power to heal you and the Earth.
Tellingly, Goop's first fragrance was 'Church.' Church perfume runs $165 for a 1.7-ounce bottle (Chanel No. 5 is a comparative bargain at $105), and a Church-scented candle costs a whopping $72. Why? Unlike the toxin-spewing Yankee Candles of unwashed commoners, Goop's scents have 'healing properties,' since they are 'composed entirely of rare, all-natural elements imbued with the power to entrance, heal, and transform.'-
The 'all-natural' is crucial. In the church of Goop, holiness is rebranded as 'naturalness' and God as Mother Nature. Flattened into New Age platitudes, the ancient wisdom on offer ultimately boils down to a vague spiritual connection with nature. Like the fragrances, everything for sale is supposedly natural; products sold elsewhere, you're reminded constantly, are not: 'Those of you who have read goop for a long time know that we try to do well by our bodies, our kids, and the environment as much as possible,' reads a characteristic blog post. A typical unnatural lifestyle " read: unholy " desecrates all it touches. Living naturally is the only way to be well and do well.-
And make no mistake: You can't be well and do well on the cheap. The engine of Goop's brand is the premise that natural purity is expensive. Poor people can't afford to be this good. When Paltrow tells Harvard Business School students, 'It's crucial to me that we remain aspirational,' she is referring to a way of being, not merely a way of shopping. Spend a few moments on Goop's site, and you quickly understand that it isn't just beauty, or quality, that's set up as aspirational. It's wisdom and purity of intention, in contrast to the rest of the world. As the company puts it in its mission statement:-
'We believe that the little things count, that good food is the foundation of love and wellness, that the mind/body/spirit is inextricably linked, and we have more control over how we express our health than we currently understand.
'We believe in making every choice count.'-
The good life, in every sense, becomes a luxury.-
In my forthcoming book, 'Natural,' I describe this as 'consecrated consumption,' which transforms the ritual of using expensive natural products into a kind of sacrament. Purity is necessarily a function of class. Like the caste system, your socio-economic status determines your place in a spiritual hierarchy " and that of your children: 'Babies are born pre-polluted,' warns a Goop post on the importance of pre-pregnancy detox. If you want to conceive unpolluted children, you should take 'easy pre-steps' like 'detoxing your personal care routine, and eating organic as possible.'
This pseudospirituality is as misguided and dangerous as the pseudoscience used to sell it. By any reasonable measure, the lavish lifestyle of those who partake in the Goop 'luxury wellness' cruise is far worse for Mother Nature than that of their poorer counterparts, even if the latter can't afford 'clean beauty.' Our complicity in the environmental crises we face is more likely to be eased by taking public transportation " or, better, supporting politicians who prioritize clean energy and sustainable urban planning " than by wearing Phyto-Pigments Ultra-Natural Mascara to the In Goop Health wellness conference ($1,000 each day, B-12 shots and 'swag-loaded gift bag' included).-
And while money can indeed purchase wellness, it is not through the alchemical power of natural goodness but rather the ability to afford health care, to live farther from freeways and factories, and to enjoy freedom from the everyday anxieties of poverty. Goop distracts from systemic problems and reframes unwellness as a result of misguided individual choices that can be corrected with a #goopdetox and a meditation retreat. Are you sick? Is the natural world threatened? It's not a broken system, it's your poorly aligned chakras and conventional produce.-
Of course, Goop seems impervious to outside expertise. A 2018 New York Times Magazine headline " 'How Goop's Haters Made Gwyneth Paltrow's Company Worth $250-Million' " suggests that articles like this one are counterproductive. Goop itself has proudly adopted that position, declaring, 'The derision means that people begin to have conversations.' Why bring attention to what would otherwise be a fringe phenomenon for the 1-percent, ask the critics of the critics?
But Goop is not a thing of the fringe; it's merely the Netflix-ready version of a common faith. Paltrow did not invent the greenwashing of classist, consecrated consumption: Her brand of nature worship can also be found in that real-world Diagon Alley, the Whole Foods supplement aisle. (Whole Foods is owned by Amazon, whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post.) It is the reason people think organic food is salvific and conventional food is deadly ('Scary GMO Apples Hit Stores,' reads a Goop headline). It explains why parents in wealthy Los Angeles schools opt for 'natural' immunity, resulting in vaccination rates on a par with those in South Sudan. Worst of all, it depends on the assumption that the best life " both physically and ethically " is accessible only for the rich, and that wellness, ours and the planet's, is to be secured primarily by people making natural purchases, rather than communities making compassionate policy. Goop is a symptom of the fact that these beliefs are widespread, and remaining silent about why they are misguided won't make them go away.
If we really want to purify ourselves, we should take the simple step of detoxifying the world of this false religion wherever it's found. And a good place to start is with a prominent business that suggests there's virtue in shelling out $72 for an all-natural Church scented candle.

Bipartisanship

Texto completo: It is common for Americans to rue the absence of bipartisanship. Even expressly partisan figures like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and President Trump have called for more cross-party collaboration. Former vice president Joe Biden has said that 'no party should have too much power.' And there is even a prestigious think tank, the Bipartisan Policy Center, dedicated to the idea. The calls may be nothing new, but they have increased in intensity and volume as our times have become hyper-polarized, rendering bipartisanship the subject of many myths.-
Myth No. 1 Bipartisanship was the norm through most of U.S. history. NPR lamented that Sen. John McCain's death in 2018 symbolized 'the near-extinction of lawmakers who believe in seeking bipartisanship to tackle big problems.' A bipartisan pundit duo wrote in the Hill before the 2018 election that bipartisanship had a 'strong record of success,' citing President Bill Clinton collaborating with Republicans and President Ronald Reagan working with Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill.
But our history is littered with times when partisan rancor was literally deadly. As historian Joanne Freeman's 'The Field of Blood' points out, disputes between the parties included plenty of violence in Congress in the decades before the Civil War. In 1902, a fistfight broke out on the Senate floor when Democratic Sen. Benjamin Tillman was angered that fellow Democrat John McLaurin was even considering siding with Republicans . Physical altercations between the parties abated in the 20th century, at least, but partisan conflict has remained the norm. The period from the 1930s into the 1970s, when a 'conservative coalition' of Republicans and Southern Democrats worked together to form majorities, is the exception. And that bipartisanship was achieved at the cost of preserving and protecting Jim Crow.-
Myth No. 2 The partisan divide is driven by policy. In their platforms, the parties have stark differences in outlook and policy. Journalist Jonathan Salant says they are '180 degrees apart.' The Pew Research Center concludes that Democrats and Republicans are growing ever more divided on fundamental priorities.
But more than specific policies, strong tribal identities and intense competition for control of government drive our partisan polarization. One psychology study found, for instance, that public views on climate change polarize when Democrats and Republicans are told that the policies they are asked to evaluate were supported or opposed by the other party. The Affordable Care Act was designed to appeal to Republicans by adopting key elements from the GOP alternative to the 1993 Clinton health-care plan and from then-Gov. Mitt Romney's plan in Massachusetts. The unified Republican opposition was not about policy differences but was part of a deliberate strategy, crafted on the eve of Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009, to oppose and delegitimize all his major initiatives. On immigration reform, the Senate had broad bipartisan agreement during the Obama years, but legislation died in the House because of a desire to keep the president from securing a victory. Once Donald Trump took office, Republican senators who had supported those reforms turned against them. For example, Florida's Marco Rubio, one of the key architects of the earlier reform, shifted to back Trump's more restrictive approach.
From health care to climate to stimulus to deficit reduction to trade, debates where there was long common ground " and where there still is significant overlap " have been superseded by partisan warfare.
Myth No. 3 Bipartisanship is more valued by voters than by politicians. Voters often express frustration that their elected representatives just won't stop bickering and do the right thing. More than two decades ago, John Hibbing and Elizabeth Theiss-Morse documented in their book 'Congress as Public Enemy' that voters have little patience for the actual workings of democracy, its unruly debates and inevitable compromises. As a result, they embrace the rhetoric of bipartisanship to avoid the unseemliness of politics. A recent survey from USA Today, Public Agenda and Ipsos found that Americans 'are sick and tired of being so divided.'
In reality, the voters who are best informed " who make up less than a majority of voters " are also the voters most attached to parties. Reinforced by activists and partisan media, these voters expect their representatives to toe the party line, not embrace bipartisanship. This is consistent with well-demonstrated affective negative partisanship:-Voters view the other party as the enemy and don't approve of their representatives consorting with it.-The credible threat of a primary challenge is a frequent topic of discussion and concern in the halls of Congress.
Myth No. 4 Major policy changes require bipartisanship. When then-first lady Hillary Clinton struggled with the administration's version of health-care reform in 1993, then-Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said, 'Something like this passes with 75 votes or not at all.' Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) has said a reason most of his legislation is bipartisan is that 'if you introduce legislation that only has support from one party, it will not last very long.'
But the notion that major social policy requires broad bipartisan consensus has been belied by a host of examples. It is true that many Republicans joined Democrats in the final votes to pass Social Security and Medicare, and a larger number worked with the majority Democrats on improving the legislation and making sure the programs were implemented. The same happened with Democrats' support for implementing George W. Bush's Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. But bitter partisan warfare and rhetoric marked the lead-up to these programs' passage, and successes came because enough members of the majority party backed those proposals. On Medicare Part D, for instance, initial Democratic support declined dramatically in the face of partisan hardball played by then-Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Republican leaders. The New York Times reported the day after the House vote: 'A fiercely polarized House approved legislation on Saturday that would add prescription drug benefits to Medicare, after an all-night session and an extraordinary bout of Republican arm-twisting to muster a majority. The Senate opened its debate under threat of a filibuster.'
Myth No. 5 The two parties are equally to blame for partisan squabbles. Democrats and Republicans are often both held responsible for the rise of hyper-partisanship. The term of choice among a minority of skeptics is 'false equivalence.' After McCain's death, former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw said that 'both parties, they're more ideologues than they are authentic people.'-Howard Schultz's aborted independent effort early in the 2020 presidential campaign also faulted both parties for Washington's problems.
But our research has found that one party bears more of the blame. The bipartisanship that was common in the House through the mid-1970s began to fray as racial and cultural differences came to define the increasingly polarized and competitive parties. Partisan polarization began with these shifts in the coalitional bases of the parties, but Republicans, because of their increasingly homogeneous positions on race, religious traditionalism and other cultural issues, had more incentive to move right than Democrats had to move left. In the 1990s, Newt Gingrich and his allies fomented tribalism, using the House ethics process as a political weapon and uniting the GOP into a parliamentary-style opposition party. They had important and vocal allies in partisan media, starting with Rush Limbaugh and talk radio. Much the same happened a bit later in the Senate, where McConnell turned the filibuster into a weapon of mass obstruction and got his party to unite against every Obama initiative.
Today, Republicans are one of the most extreme (even radical) conservative parties in the democratic world, with no members in the House and arguably barely one in the Senate who would qualify as moderates or traditional conservatives, while Democrats look like a traditional center-left party. Though the 'Squad' of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib receives much attention, a breakdown of voting records shows that the Democratic caucus is populated by more moderates than leftists. The asymmetric nature of this polarization makes bipartisanship almost impossible.

Texto completo: Americans deserve an economy that is driven by values
Economist Milton Friedman’s 1970 New York Times Magazine essay, “The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits,” was one of the impetuses that started a movement that has taken our economy on a rapid turn toward maximizing profits over people, money over values and “me” over “us.”
I have seen the worst of this mentality during my decade working at a multinational corporation. So often our goals in search of “efficiency” were at the expense of others’ livelihoods, putting the values-driven and business-driven parts of me at odds.
I feel this is the same conundrum we so often face as a nation: my interest vs. our interests.
I am supporting Sen. Elizabeth Warren because I feel she is the best person to tackle the issues of corruption and wealth inequality in our culture.
We see this debate enter into our political discourse when we talk about topics like education, wealth inequality and health care. I see a lot of Warren in myself.
We both made missteps in our youth and didn’t attend college at an early age like many of our peers. She was able to afford commuter college working part-time as a waitress.
As the son of a single mother who was raising three boys on a secretary’s pay, the price I paid for an affordable post-secondary education was more than two years in Iraq.
I agree with Warren: College should be free. I don’t believe the price of an education should be 3% of one’s life in a war zone, or a lifetime of crippling debt.
This profit-over-people mentality, which is so prevalent in our culture, imposes a misguided view that profits equal prosperity when everything that actually matters in our life revolves around values, connections and compassion.
Warren’s empathetic leadership style and track record of accomplishment are exactly what we need at this moment to bring us back from the brink and create the values-driven economy we deserve.

A reconsideration of nuclear power
Recently, CPV Sullivan Wind LLC leased 800 acres on Green Mountain in Claremont “with an eye toward building and operating a wind-power farm” (“Land deal could mean a wind farm coming to Claremont,” Jan. 12).
This site is about 14 miles from the 12-turbine Lempster Wind Power Project. If we assume the new project generates the same power as Lempster does, then that’s 24 megawatts — or 10,000 homes — worth of wind power.
Sounds like a great number, until it is put into perspective. The Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, which closed a few years ago, could generate 620 megawatts, enough to power 250,000 homes.
There are currently three wind power projects in New Hampshire and five in Vermont. Generously assuming full output, the total potential wind power generation combined is about 320 MW — barely half Yankee’s final capacity.
Taking a look at solar, if we give the also-generous assumption that peak summer generation applies all year, Vermont offers a total of about 338 MW of power from solar, and New Hampshire about 99 MW.
Combining all existing solar and wind power across both states, we get 757 MW of peak, ideal-condition power generation potential. Taking a more realistic account for variation, let’s call it 500 MW.
This deserves restating differently: The 1960s design Yankee plant, when it first opened, generated the same 500 MW of power. New Hampshire’s circa-1970s Seabrook Nuclear Plant, meanwhile, is generating 1,246 MW, 2.5 times all those solar panels and wind turbines in our states.
We’re pumping exactly the same amount of carbon into the atmosphere — zero — whether we’re taking it from one nuclear plant in 1972, or from the combination of every single solar panel and wind turbine across Vermont and New Hampshire in 2020. Yet our energy requirements have more than doubled.
Well intentioned environmentalists and politicians, especially Progressives, who write off nuclear, would be well served to consider how much carbon-free energy we could safely generate with 2020s nuclear power technology.

A mistake of much greater magnitude
We have been incredibly lucky. Somehow the mistake some poor Iranian mortal(s) made this month resulted in only 176 dead (“Western leaders say missile hit plane,” Jan. 10). Imagine the destruction if some poor mortal(s) of whatever nation made a similar mistake — and lit off an atomic weapon, thus starting a worldwide nuclear war. As CNBC noted last March: “There are about 14,500 nuclear weapons in the world. Nine nations are members of the world’s nuke club. The U.S. and Russia own the majority of the world’s nuclear weapons.”

Let's focus on Trump's broken promises

Texto completo: Is Ohio blue? Is Ohio red? Is Ohio purple? As with the ambiguously colored dress that captivated the Internet a couple of years ago, everyone has a different perspective on Ohio's political outlook.

One thing we can all agree on, though, is that Ohio is in play this year. President Trump just can't seem to stay away from the Buckeye State, a sign that his campaign will be investing heavily here heading into November's election.

Democrats have been highlighting Mr. Trump's broken promises in Ohio, pointing to job losses, the Lordstown plant closure, and manufacturing and farming declines in the state. They're right. President Trump has let Ohioans down after he promised we would thrive during his administration. Those broken promises are devastating.

But he kept promises too, and those are just as harmful to Ohioans as the ones he didn't keep. If we want to beat him this November, we need to focus on those promises and the people the GOP have hurt.

We all heard Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women and wanting to punish us for having abortions.

Thanks to his extreme rhetoric and the hundreds of anti-choice judges he's named, the Ohio General Assembly has been asked to consider an abortion ban that will allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty for women who have abortions. That's right. The death penalty for abortion.

Mr. Trump promised to fund private charter schools. When he was elected, schools were already suffering from tax cuts that stripped opportunities from students.

Ohio Republicans followed his lead and made that problem worse with our most recent state budget, transferring even more local school district funding to private charter schools.

And don't even get me started on the new Ohio law requiring teachers to give students full credit for wrong answers for religious reasons.

One of Mr. Trump's most infamous campaign promises was building a wall and making Mexico pay for it. We have a wall, but we're still waiting on Mexico's check.

This pointless exercise in construction and wasteful spending has done little to curb border crossings, but it has increased the violent, hateful anti-immigrant and racist rhetoric in our society.

The ill-fated Muslim ban has made a similar impact. An entire generation of our children are growing up in a world where unchecked racism and Islamophobia are commonplace. Whether we're red or blue, Ohioans aren't OK with that.

His long history of racism continued when he moved to Washington. The same man who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times calling for the death penalty for the exonerated Central Park 5 often uses Twitter to launch racist attacks at members of Congress.

Is it any surprise that communities like East Cleveland are struggling to overcome the effects of redlining while the President is calling majority-black cities disgusting and rodent-infested and worse?

Democrats can't lose sight of the people who make up the party. In January, 2017, the day after Mr. Trump's inauguration, more than 4 million people took to the streets for the inaugural Women's March.

They weren't marching for jobs and manufacturing. Beating Mr. Trump starts with facing what he is - a racist, sexist, bully - and making it perfectly clear to Ohioans that there's a better choice out there.

Mass. judge orders Facebook to turn over information to Healey

Texto completo: A Massachusetts judge has ordered Facebook to turn over information regarding thousands of apps that the social media behemoth suspects of misusing users' data to the state's attorney general office.
Suffolk Superior Court Judge Brian A. Davis's Friday decision spurned arguments from Facebook, which had previously refused to give the information to state investigators.
The judge's order came almost two years after Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced a probe into Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Facebook has said that personal information of up to 87 million people, most of them Americans, may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm connected to President Trump during the 2016 election.
Facebook's technological infrastructure allows third-party developers to create apps that can be utilized by the platform's users, according to court documents. Davis, in his order, said such apps include games, location-based services, music-playing services, and news feeds.
According to Healey's office, the case is about protecting state residents from the unauthorized disclosure and potential misuse of data they choose to share with Facebook.
“Consumers have a right to know how their personal information is used," the Charlestown Democrat said in a statement Friday. “Facebook simply telling its users that their data is safe without the facts to back it up does not work for us."
As attorney general, Healey has the authority to investigate unfair or deceptive trade practices. In this case, her office seeks, among other things, “to identify other instances of potential misuse and consumer harm, to assess whether Facebook has acted and is acting consistently with its representations to users regarding its policies and practices to safeguard their data on the Platform, and to identify other potential targets for investigation or enforcement action," according to court documents.
Since announcing its investigation in March 2018, Healey's office has since issued three civil subpoenas to try to determine the breadth of unauthorized sharing of Facebook users' data with third parties. Healey wants to know which other app developers may have engaged in conduct like Cambridge Analytica. The office also wanted to establish whether Facebook took steps to protect users against such sharing.
Davis, in his Friday decision, said it is “sufficient for present purposes to say that Facebook has produced some, but not all, of the information requested by the Attorney General."
Facebook had argued that the information Healey's office seeks is protected by the work product doctrine or attorney-client privilege, according to Friday's order. The work product doctrine is intended to “establish a zone of privacy for strategic litigation planning . . . to prevent one party from piggybacking on the adversary's preparation," the order said.
The attorney general's office, in court documents, has called that argument “meritless."
Facebook, through a spokesman, said that it was “disappointed that the Massachusetts Attorney General and the Court didn't fully consider our arguments on well-established law, including the work product doctrine."
“We are reviewing our options, including appeal," said the spokesman in a statement.
The same month Healey's office announced its investigation, Facebook launched an internal probe aimed at investigating “all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform in 2014 to reduce data access, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity," according to court documents.
Friday's order stated that since announcing that probe, Facebook has given public updates indicating that millions of apps had been investigated, and has suspended tens of thousands of apps and about 400 app developers. But the tech giant has denied Healey's office some information regarding the findings of its own investigation.
“In particular, Facebook has refused. . . to turn over to the Attorney General certain information generated in the course of its [probe] about the specific apps, group of apps, and app developers that Facebook claims to have flagged as potentially problematic or, at the very least, has identified as worthy of additional examination," Davis wrote.
He ordered Facebook to give Healey's office the information within 90 days.
Cambridge Analytica was founded by such conservative power brokers as billionaire Robert Mercer and former White House aide Steve Bannon. Unlike Facebook, which has offices in Cambridge and was born in a Harvard dorm, the firm has no presence in the community located across the river from Boston.
A status conference for the case is set for March 31 in Plymouth Superior Court.

'Get your mops &amp; buckets ready': Trump opposes sea wall around New York City

Texto completo: President Trump came out strongly against a seawall to protect New York City from storms.
The New York Times reported on Friday that the Army Corps of Engineers is currently examining five options to protect New York City from increasingly frequent storms, one of which includes building a six-mile wall to block any flooding. The proposed barrier is estimated to cost $119 billion and would take 25 years to construct. President Trump took notice of this, voicing his opinion on Twitter.
"A massive 200 Billion Dollar Seal Wall, built around New York to protect it from rare storms, is a costly, foolish & environmentally unfriendly idea that, when needed, probably won't work anyway. It will also look terrible," the president said on Twitter. "Sorry, you'll just have to get your mops & buckets ready!"
Tweet
The president is not alone in his opposition to the barrier. Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, also opposes the seawall, urging the Corps to consider other options in a letter. Stringer says that the barrier, once built, would not be sufficient to counter rising water levels should it occur.
"These sea gates will not be able to protect communities from flooding caused by rising tides and rising sea levels, and once they’re built, that’s it. We’re not going to get the money again," Stringer said.
Others, such as Kimberly Ong, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, have pointed out the sanitation risks of the proposal. Ong cites how a barrier could "trap sludge closer to shore" because sewage can back up in the city when it rains.
"We’d essentially be sitting in a bathtub of our own excrement,” she told the New York Times.
This particular debate on New York City's infrastructure began after the city was rocked by Tropical Storm Sandy in 2012. Forty-three people in New York City died, and over 2 million people were left without power as a result of the storm.

'Miracle on the Hudson' pilot blasts Lara Trump: 'Show some decency'

Texto completo: Captain Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger, the retired pilot who safely landed an airplane on the Hudson river in 2009, slammed Lara Trump in an op-ed on Saturday.
"Whether you stuttered as a child or laughed at one who did; whether as a parent you try to protect your own stuttering child from taunts such as those made by the president’s daughter-in-law; these words come without hesitation: Stop. Grow up. Show some decency. People who can’t have no place in public life," Sullenberger, 68, wrote in the New York Times.
Sullenberg discloses that he is a supporter of Joe Biden for president, noting that he attended a fundraiser for the former vice president in 2019. However, he believes Trump's mocking of Biden "goes beyond politics." The incident Sullenberg refers to occurred at a campaign event for President Trump on Thursday in Iowa, where Lara Trump ostensibly mocked Biden's stutter on debate stages.
"I feel kind of sad for Biden ... I'm supposed to want him to fail at every turn, but every time he comes onstage or they turn to him, I'm like, 'Joe, can you get it out? Let's get the words out, Joe," said the president's daughter-in-law.
Tweet
Lara Trump denied the accusation that she mocked Biden in a tweet on Friday, citing it as "another example of the egregious reporting we see every day in the mainstream media."

Texto completo: Billionaire presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg requested an extension on keeping the details of his fortune secret until after millions of voters have participated in the 2020 Democratic primaries.
Bloomberg received an extended deadline to file his financial disclosure form more than two weeks after Super Tuesday, the New York Times reported.
The former New York City mayor, who is worth an estimated $50 billion, entered the race in November, months after his Democratic rivals.
Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, another billionaire running for the nomination, have been accused of using their wealth to buy the nomination. Bloomberg, 77, has already poured more than $200 million into television and digital ads in the past two months.
If Bloomberg were to end his candidacy before March 20, he could exit the race without having to make any financial disclosures.
His campaign previously said he would release his tax returns but has not said when or how many years he’d disclose.

Texto completo: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will step back from their royal duties and will repay the millions they spent to refurbish their Frogmore Cottage residence, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
Under the new agreement, the couple will no longer receive public funds for royal duties and will give up their “royal highness” titles. They will maintain their private patronages and associations and will live at Frogmore Cottage when they are in the United Kingdom. Prince Harry will also give up his official military appointments.
The new arrangement will take effect in the spring, the palace said.
“Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,” Queen Elizabeth II said in a statement. “It is my whole family’s hope that today’s agreement allows them to start building a happy and peaceful new life.”
Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 38, announced last week that they planned to become financially independent and divide their time between Britain and North America.
The couple had plans to discuss the new arrangement with Prince Charles, Harry’s father, and other members of the family later this month, but they disclosed their plans earlier than expected when they learned that a British tabloid was preparing a story about the discussions, the New York Times reported.

Two Utah filmmakers want a recording of Super Bowl I, but have to fight the NFL

Texto completo: As the NFL wraps up the celebration of its 100th year, an odd coincidence has cropped up. If the Kansas City Chiefs and the Green Bay Packers take care of business in their respective conference championship games Sunday, those teams will meet in the Super Bowl for the first time since the first Super Bowl was held in 1967.
But good luck to any fan with an itch to look back at the game that started what has become the biggest annual one-day sporting event in the in the nation, if not the world; one that draws over a hundred million viewers and has practically become a national holiday. Yes, both NBC and CBS broadcast the game at the time — but then both recorded over those tapes. Today, only one tape is known to contain nearly all of Super Bowl I. It is owned by a North Carolina nurse named Troy Haupt, and it is being held in legal limbo by the NFL.
Two Utah documentary filmmakers have made it their mission to set it free.
“There’s a cut-and-dried short film there; here’s something you probably don’t know and it’s stuck in limbo,” said Tim Skousen, a BYU film school alumnus who has settled in South Jordan. “But if we really wanted Super Bowl I to see the light of day, there was something that had to be done.”
So Skousen and fellow BYU film school graduate Jeremy Coon, 40 — best known for their work on the cult classic film “Napoleon Dynamite” — began a Kickstarter campaign Wednesday with the ultimate goal of streaming Super Bowl I the week prior to the 2021 Super Bowl.
SUNDAY’S CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES
AFC
Tennessee at Kansas City, 1:05 p.m., Ch. 2
NFC
Green Bay at San Francisco, 4:40 p.m., Ch. 13
They set an initial goal of $50,000. That, they say, would be enough to allow them to produce a rudimentary documentary on the mystifying tale of the loss, discovery and censoring of the rare footage of the original Super Bowl. If they raise $200,000, they promise to make a more refined film. Their stretch goal, meanwhile, is $1.5 million. With those resources, they say, they will not only be able to acquire the only known tape of the game but pay for copyright lawyers they’ll need after they stream it live against the NFL’s directive.
As valuable to the project as donations, though, is public support. Coon and Skousen say enough of that might give them leverage against the NFL and help convince the league to grant them permission to air the game tape without getting the courts involved.
“That’s what’s exciting about it; it has the ability to democratize the Super Bowl,” Skousen said of the Kickstarter campaign. “That’s the cool thing. … This is one of the times where you as a football fan can actually affect the outcome of this story.
“You can vote with just a couple dollars. You have the mechanism to make your opinion known.”
As of 2 p.m. Wednesday, “The Tape: The Lost Recording of Super Bowl I” had raised $686 from 15 backers. By the same time Thursday, it had raised $5,885 from 66 backers. The campaign will run for 30 days, well past Super Bowl LIV, scheduled for 4:30 p.m. MST on Feb. 2.
“I feel a little relieved because part of me was going, ‘We’re going to throw this out to the world and no one is going to give a crap about it,’” Coon, who lives in Salt Lake City, said Wednesday. “I feel we have a long way to go, but we’re hunkering down to see where this is going.”
Data of our lives
As documentary filmmakers, Coon and Skousen often find themselves in precarious situations. Coon had a plane crash 12 feet from him while filming “Raiders: The Greatest Fan Film Ever Made.” Skousen spent time in Sing Sing, the maximum security prison in New York, while making “Zero Percent.”
This project presents a different threat.
“This is the first time I’m like, ‘Can I lose my house?’” Skousen acknowledged.
Still, when Coon first read a 2016 New York Times article about the saga of what is believed to be the only existing copy of almost the entire broadcast of Super Bowl I — it is missing halftime and part of the third quarter — he knew right away he wanted to make a film about it. He reached out to both Skousen and Haupt, the owner of the tape, that same day.
A decade earlier, Haupt found two reels from a vintage quadruplex recorder packed away in his mother’s attic in his childhood home in Pennsylvania. An old friend had read a story in Sports Illustrated listing the broadcast of the Super Bowl I as one of its top 25 lost sports treasures of all time and valuing it at about $1 million. Film at the time was expensive and footage from a game where everyone already knew the result — quarterback Bart Starr led the National Football League’s Packers to a 35-10 win over the American Football League’s Chiefs — seemed expendable. So, on went “Days of Our Lives,” at least in NBC’s case, right over the footage of Willie Wood’s third-quarter interception that turned the game around for Green Bay.
No copies of the broadcast were thought to exist until shortly after Haupt’s friend reminded him that as a kid he’d seen a box labeled “Super Bowl I” at Haupt’s house.
Why or how Haupt’s father recorded the CBS broadcast of the game on the wardrobe-sized quadruplex recorder at his work is a mystery. This was long before recording shows for home viewing became commonplace or even feasible. He died of cancer before he had a chance to explain, and the two reels went to the attic, where they weathered 30 years of heat and cold until Haupt found them.
The Paley Center for Media in Manhattan restored the footage and transferred it to a tape. More than game footage, the broadcast is a time capsule. In addition to in-game action, it includes some now cringe-worthy commercials, including one extolling the health virtues of a brand of cigarettes and another marketing a tire company to women “for when there’s no man around.”
Haupt, 51, then offered to sell the tape to the people he thought would be most interested in it: the NFL. Initially, the league offered him $30,000 — considerably less than the $1M Haupt was asking. It later rescinded its offer while sending Haupt a letter threatening legal action if he sold the tape, according to the New York Times. The family was frustrated and scared.
That’s where Coon and Skousen stepped in.
Poking the bear
Coon said he knew by taking on the project he would be picking a fight with the most popular and powerful professional sports league in the country.
“The NFL should have paid a reasonable price for it, owned it and put it out,” Coon said. “This should be a celebration rather than anything antagonistic. It’s just the NFL has not wanted to play nice, for some reason.”
Calls placed to NFL headquarters in New York seeking comment were not returned. League spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Wall Street Journal, “We are not aware of this latest endeavor, but we continue to reassert our right to enforce and protect our intellectual property.”
Before getting in too deep, the filmmakers sought out the advice of David Nimmer, an expert on copyright law. He told them he believes the NFL does not have a strong case for two reasons. One, the league is not believed to possess its own copy, especially since the NFL Network in 2016 released a recreation of the broadcast cobbled together from old NFL Films video and stills. Two, if it didn’t bother to preserve it, the league also most likely did not renew its copyright on the broadcast, possibly scuttling it into public domain.
Coon and Skousen nonetheless expect to hear from the NFL before their Kickstarter campaign expires. While they wait, they’ll watch the AFC and NFC championships with vested interest. Coon, who grew up in Texas, is a Dallas Cowboys fan. Skousen was raised rooting for Washington. On Sunday, though, they’ll both be cheering on the Chiefs and Packers.
“If it happens again, it will be the first time it’s happened since Super Bowl I, and I really think this thing could explode,” Coon said. “It’s the 100th anniversary of the NFL. A lot of things are piling up.”

Texto completo: The other day a correspondent asked me a good question: What important issue aren’t we talking about? My answer, after some reflection, is the state of America’s children.
Now, it’s not entirely fair to say that we’re ignoring the plight of our children. Elizabeth Warren, characteristically, has laid out a comprehensive, fully financed plan for universal child care. Bernie Sanders, also characteristically, says he’s for it but hasn’t provided details. And as far as I can tell, all the other Democratic presidential candidates support doing more for children.
But policy toward children has attracted far less media attention than the debate over “Medicare for All,” which won’t become reality anytime soon — let alone the so-called Warren-Sanders “spat.” And my guess is that even well-informed voters have little sense of the grim exceptionalism of America’s child-oriented policies, which are Dickensian compared with those of every other advanced country.
A few numbers may be in order here.
Every advanced country mandates some form of paid leave for new mothers, typically three or four months — every country, that is, except the United States, which offers no maternity leave at all.
Most advanced countries devote substantial sums to benefits for families with children; in Europe these benefits average between 2% and 3% percent of gross domestic product. The corresponding number for the United States is 0.6% of GDP.
Even where the United States does help children, the quality of that help tends to be poor. There have been many comparisons between French and American school lunches: French schoolchildren are taught to eat healthy meals; American children are basically treated as a disposal site for farm surpluses.
What’s especially striking is the contrast between the way we treat our children and the way we treat our senior citizens. Social Security isn’t all that generous — there’s a good case for expanding it — but it doesn’t compare too badly with other countries’ retirement systems. Medicare actually spends lavishly compared with single-payer systems elsewhere.
So America’s refusal to help children isn’t part of a broad opposition to government programs; we single out children for especially harsh treatment. Why?
The answer, I’d suggest, goes beyond the fact that children can’t vote, while seniors can and do. There has also been a poisonous interaction between racial antagonism and bad social analysis.
These days, political support for programs that aid children is surely hurt by the fact that less than half the population under 15 is non-Hispanic white. But even before immigration transformed the U.S. ethnic landscape, there was a widespread perception that programs like Aid to Families With Dependent Children basically helped Those People — you know, the bums on welfare, the welfare queens driving Cadillacs.
This perception undermined support for spending on children. And it went along with a widespread belief that aid to poor families was creating a culture of dependency, which in turn was the culprit behind social collapse in U.S. inner cities. Partly in response, aid to families, such as it was, increasingly came with work requirements, or took the form of things like the earned-income tax credit, which is linked to earnings.
The result was a decline in assistance for the poor children who needed it most.
At this point, however, we know that cultural explanations of social collapse were all wrong. Sociologist William Julius Wilson argued long ago that social dysfunction in big cities was caused not by culture but by the disappearance of good jobs. And he has been vindicated by what happened to much of the U.S. heartland, which suffered a similar disappearance of good jobs and a similar surge in social dysfunction.
What this means is that we’ve established a basically vicious system under which children can’t get the help they need unless their parents find jobs that don’t exist. And a growing body of evidence says that this system is destructive as well as cruel.
Multiple studies have found that safety-net programs for children have big long-term consequences. Children who receive adequate nutrition and health care grow up to become healthier, more productive adults. And in addition to the humanitarian side of these benefits, there’s a monetary payoff: Healthier adults are less likely to need public aid and are likely to pay more in taxes.
It’s probably too much to claim that helping children pays for itself. But it surely comes a lot closer to doing so than tax cuts for the rich.
So we should be talking a lot more about helping America’s children. Why aren’t we?
At least part of the blame rests with Bernie Sanders, who made Medicare for All both a progressive purity test and a bright shiny object chased by the news media at the expense of other policies that could greatly improve American lives, and are far more likely to become law. But it’s not too late to refocus.
Whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, I hope he or she will give our nation’s shameful treatment of children the attention it deserves.

Emma Marris: How to stop freaking out and tackle climate change

Texto completo: You are scrolling through the news and see yet another story about climate change.
Australia is on fire. Indonesia is drowning. At the same time, Donald Trump is trying to make it easier to build new fossil-fuel projects.
As you read, your chest tightens and a sense of dread washes over you, radiating out from your heart. You feel anxious, afraid and intensely guilty. Just this morning, you drove a gasoline-powered car to work. You ate beef for lunch. You booked a flight, turned on the heat, forgot your reusable grocery bags at home. This is your fault .
As an environmental writer, I’m often asked for guidance on coping with climate change. I have thoughts. Even better, I have a five-point plan to manage the psychological toll of living with climate change and to become part of the solution.
Step 1: Ditch the shame.
The first step is key to all the rest. Yes, our daily lives are undoubtedly contributing to climate change. But that’s because the rich and powerful have constructed systems that make it nearly impossible to live lightly on the earth. Our economic systems require most adults to work, and many of us must commute to work in or to cities intentionally designed to favor the automobile. Unsustainable food, clothes and other goods remain cheaper than sustainable alternatives.
And yet we blame ourselves for not being green enough. As the climate essayist Mary Annaïse Heglar writes, “The belief that this enormous, existential problem could have been fixed if all of us had just tweaked our consumptive habits is not only preposterous; it’s dangerous.” It turns eco-saints against eco-sinners, who are really just fellow victims. It misleads us into thinking that we have agency only by dint of our consumption habits — that buying correctly is the only way we can fight climate change.
As long as we are competing for the title of “greener than thou,” or are paralyzed by shame, we aren’t fighting the powerful companies and governments that are the real problem. And that’s exactly the way they like it.
Step 2: Focus on systems, not yourself.
Even if we manage to zero-out our own contributions to climate change, it would be practically a full-time job, leaving us little time or energy for pushing for the systemic changes we need. And the avoided emissions would be tiny compared with the scale of the problem. Each person in the United States emitted an average of 16 metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide in 2018, according to the Energy Information Agency. The entire country emitted 5.28 billion metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide that year.
I have chosen to fight against a proposed gas pipeline, liquefaction facility and liquefied natural gas export terminal that the Canadian company Pembina wants to build in Oregon, where I live. If built, the project would result in emissions of over 36.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Some 42,000 people submitted comments to a state agency asking it to deny permits for the project. If we manage to stop construction, each of those people could claim credit for preventing one-forty-two-thousandths of those emissions — some 876 metric tons per person! It would take 54 years of individual zero-carbon living to make the same dent.
My point is that the climate crisis is not going to be solved by personal sacrifice. It will be solved by electing the right people, passing the right laws, drafting the right regulations, signing the right treaties — and respecting those treaties already signed, particularly with indigenous nations. It will be solved by holding the companies and people who have made billions off our shared atmosphere to account.
Step 3: Join an effective group.
These sweeping, systemic changes are complicated and will be hard won. No single person alone can make them happen. Luckily, there are already dozens if not hundreds of groups dedicated to climate activism. Some are local and focused on stopping particular fossil-fuel projects, like Rogue Climate in Southern Oregon, with which I am working. Others are national and focused on changing federal policy, like Zero Hour and the Sunrise Movement. Still others, like Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future, are international and focused on putting moral pressure on climate negotiators and governments around the world. Groups like Project Drawdown research the nuts and bolts of decarbonizing the world. Climate change is linked to income inequality and injustice, so if your passion is fighting for racial justice, the rights of the poor, or indigenous rights and sovereignty, that works, too. Or you might volunteer for a climate-focused local or national political candidate.
Step 4: Define your role.
The power of these groups is not simply strength in numbers. They work well because they divide up the work that needs to be done and give each task to those best suited to it. This also makes the fight less daunting. Instead of trying to become an expert in international regulatory law, global supply chains, atmospheric science and the art of protest, you can offer the skills and resources you already have, and trust that other people with complementary skills are doing what they can do, too. If you are a writer, you can write letters to the editor, newsletters and fliers. If you are strong, you can lift boxes. If you are rich, you can donate money. Only you know what and how much you can reasonably do. Take care not to overdo it at first and risk burning out. Set a sustainable level of involvement for yourself and keep it up. As a bonus, working with a group will increase the richness and diversity of your personal relationships, and may well temper your climate anxiety and depression.
Step 5: Know what you are fighting for, not just what you are fighting against.
Even though keeping global warming under 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) would absolutely be better than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) of warming, there is no threshold that means that it is “too late” or that we are “doomed.” The lower, the better. It is always worth fighting.
As we fight, it is important for our mental health and motivation to have an image in mind of our goal: a realistically good future.
Imagine dense but livable cities veined with public transit and leafy parks, infrastructure humming away to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, fake meat that tastes better than the real thing, species recovering and rewilding the world, the rivers silver with fish, the skies musical with flocking birds.
This is a future where the economic inequality, racism and colonialism that made decades of inaction on climate change possible has been acknowledged and is being addressed. It is a time of healing. Many ecosystems have changed, but natural resilience and thoughtful human assistance is preventing most species from going extinct. This is a future in which children don’t need to take to the streets in protest and alarm, because their parents and grandparents took action. Instead, they are climbing trees.
This future is still possible. But it will only come to pass if we shed our shame, stop focusing on ourselves, join together and demand it.

The Queen said the Sussexes “will continue to maintain their private patronages and associations.”
The couple also will no longer formally represent the Queen, the statement said.
"Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much-loved members of my family, the Queen wrote. “I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.”
The couple will forgo state funding and repay millions of taxpayer dollars used to refurbish their official residence in Windsor, The New York Times reported.
The agreement will go into effect later this spring and will be reviewed by the palace after a year, the newspaper reported.
“The Sussexes will not use their HRH titles as they are no longer working members of the Royal Family,” according to the statement from Buckingham Palace.
The agreement was made to end the crisis that began 10 days ago when the couple announced plans to step back from their royal duties and spend time in North America, the Times reported.

The financial perks of off-season travel: Cheaper airfare, cruises, rental cars, tours

Texto completo: Airfare, hotels and even some tourist attractions get pricier during the high season when swarms of travelers hit the road in record numbers. But while weather conditions might be perfect during high season, it’s the off-season that offers the best deals.
From cheaper flights to empty cruises, GoBankingRates. com shows you how off-season travel lets you experience the world without spending a fortune.
Airfare plummets in the off-season
Low airfare is just one of the many desirable advantages of off-season travel. But, you’ll need to do your research to find out when your favorite destinations are in low season.
While summer flight prices are traditionally high, some destinations actually have lower rates during the hotter part of the year. Some typical winter destinations like ski resorts see a dip in foot traffic in the summer, but still have a lot to offer visitors when the snow’s melted, according to Consumer Reports.
Even destinations like the Caribbean see a dip in tourism over the summer. If you can handle scorching temperatures, you’re bound to find steep discounts on airfare. For even deeper discounts, keep your travel plans open and run “flexible trip” searches with online travel sites.
Grab your calendar: These are the cheapest days to fly in 2020
Get low-cost luxury seating on empty flights
These days, plane passengers don’t just pay extra for premium seats. In fact, many airlines charge hidden fees for the more desirable economy seats, such as those with a few extra inches of legroom.
For example, Air New Zealand charges up to $1,500 extra for two passengers in its Economy Skycouch seating. This fee gets you three seats with flip-up footrests and armrests that transform the row into a comfy couch.
If you arrange for off-season travel, you might not need to pay for better seats. Since long-haul flights are likely to be sparsely populated at this time, you can create your own “sky couch” by nabbing an empty economy row and a few pillows. You’ll arrive at your destination rested and ready for fun.
No, you can't move into that empty extra legroom seat: They cost extra
You can pay less to stay longer
It’s common knowledge that hotel rates drop during the low season. Along with scoring hotel rooms for rock-bottom rates, you can often purchase luxury accommodations for less.
According to The New York Times, Miami hotels often reduce high-season rates by 50% during slow times. Additionally, you can snag special deals like free valet service, a fourth night free or a hefty credit toward meals at the hotel restaurant.
If you’ve been dreaming of vacationing in Europe on the cheap, expect to find lower hotel rates from November through March. The cold will be biting, but popular destinations tend to be more affordable. Travel from mid-June through August, though, and say goodbye to your savings.

Go low: What months are considered low season for travel in Europe?
Leisure activities cost less
Whatever leisure activities you have in mind for your vacation, you’ll likely pay less during the low season. If getting a relaxing massage or rejuvenating facial is on your shortlist, book during the off-season to get more for your money. In fact, in July and August, Miami’s low season, the city’s premier spas (under the auspices of “Spa Month”) drop their prices by up to 50%.
You’ll find great spa deals when you head to ski country in warm weather, as well. Spas in Vail, Colo. , for example, offer significant discounts for off-season visitors.
If you’d rather spend time with a caddy than a massage therapist, you’ll find discounts on off-season greens fees across the country. Off-season tours are less expensive
If you dream of embarking on a wildlife safari in Africa or a guided tour of Egypt’s pyramids, rearranging your schedule can save you money. According to Travel + Leisure, safari lodges offer serious low-season deals and discounts, with prices dropping by up to 40%.
For example, you’ll pay up to $3,770 in the high season for a family tent at the legendary Cottar’s Safari Service, which boasts sunset views across the Serengeti. Green-season (mid-March through May) prices dip to $2,181 a night, however.
Many tour companies offer special off-season discounts, as well. Go Ahead Tours, for example, cuts prices on tours happening around the world – from Alaska to the U. K. and Italy – with low demand.
Tour guide: 5 best websites for booking day tours and other travel activities
You can go cruising for a deal
If you want to relax on an affordable cruise, you can still get big discounts by scheduling your trip off-season. High and low seasons vary depending on the body of water in question, so do your research before booking a trip.
While you can certainly score a deal on a traditional ocean cruise during the off-season, the best savings occur on the river. Not only can you get discount rates on European river cruises during the “shoulder” months of fall or early spring, but you’ll also enjoy more elbow room and better accommodations at this time of year.
Repositioning cruises will save you even more. With this cruise option, your ship departs from one port and drops you at another. As a result, you can explore two different cities while enjoying big discounts. Best of all, repositioning cruises are typically less crowded, so you won’t have to worry about packed pools or lines at the buffet.
What is wave season? And are these early-season cruise deals really worth it?
Score more rental car for less money
It’s nice to have wheels when you are away from home, and many travelers consider a rental car an essential part of the travel package. Like every other commodity, rental car prices rise when a lot of other people are renting, too.
In fact, rental agencies use software that links both to online travel sites and competitor sites. Prices rise when demand peaks and inventory is low. It doesn’t take a brain scientist to figure out that this most often happens in a location’s high season.
So, how do you get the best rate? Travel off-season and book a vehicle well in advance. Then, check the going price every few weeks until your travel day. If a better price is available, grab it and cancel the reservation you have. You won’t incur a fee for this and might even be able to snag more car for less money.
Prices dip for off-season dining
Eating out can make or break a vacation, as well as a vacation budget. The more you love fine dining, the more it makes sense to consider off-season travel.
Remember, supply and demand is the basic rule. As demand drops in the off-season, prices drop, including food prices. That’s as true in popular European destinations like Barcelona as it is in America’s resort cities.
Some cities even hold “restaurant weeks” during the off-season. For example, popular Miami Beach is less popular when it swelters in August and September. So this sultry South Florida city offers incredible food deals at this time, such as “Miami Spice,” which is packed full of restaurant bargains and foodie-related events. Plus, with fewer tourists, you’ll get reservations more easily – and your waiters will be less stressed.
Ride the rails for less
Taking a train might be the main course of your vacation, such as if you’re traveling across Canada by train. It can also be a delicious side dish, like when you’re visiting London and then heading to the coast on a South Western Railway train. In either case, you’ll likely do far better on price if you book in advance and travel off-season.
According to South Western Railway, traveling outside of busy periods pays off financially. You’ll also have a quieter, more serene ride. Almost any destination with a clear high season will lower fares during the low season.
Think of Alaska, the Last Frontier. It attracts crowds to incredible Denali Park in the summer, but riders disappear in the long, cold Alaskan winter. Does it surprise you to learn that a train ticket between Anchorage and Fairbanks goes for $244 in summer but only $195 in winter?

Texto completo: The Transportation Security Administration caught more firearms at airport checkpoints in 2019 than in any other year since it was created in 2001, the agency said, as part of a steady uptick that its leader called "deeply troubling."
The agency said that it found 4,432 firearms last year in carry-on bags or carried by passengers, neither of which is allowed. That number was 5% higher than the 4,239 firearms discovered in 2018 and nearly five times the 926 found in 2008, the TSA said.
A vast majority of the guns found in 2019 -- almost 90% -- were loaded, the TSA said. About one-third of the guns caught had a round in the chamber.
"The continued increase in the number of firearms that travelers bring to airport checkpoints is deeply troubling," David Pekoske, administrator of the TSA, said in a statement this week. He advised flyers to follow the rules of the "proper way to travel safely with a firearm."
The airports where the most firearms were found in 2019 were at three major hubs: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, 323; Dallas/Fort Worth International, 217; and Denver International, 140.
Jenny Burke, a TSA spokeswoman, said the agency did not speculate on why the numbers were increasing because "a lot of factors" could play a role. She said it was important "to note that there is an increasing volume of travelers every year."
Jeff Price, a professor of aviation management at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, said the increase was a "conundrum our industry has been trying to figure out for a while."
"It's not like it's unknown to the average public that you're not supposed to carry a gun on the plane," he said.
Price, who trains airport staff nationwide on security issues, said improved technology could be detecting more firearms.

US driven by Trump's evil, and it is spreading op-ED

Texto completo: It passed with the usual shrug by the usual handmaidens of hatred when the president of the world's most powerful democracy threatened to commit war crimes by bombing Iranian cultural sites - the kind of barbarism practiced by the Taliban and rogue-state thugs.
After being told that he would be in violation of Geneva Convention rules that the United States had helped to create back when America was actually great, President Donald Trump relented, but still wondered: Why not?
The warlord-in-chief had already gone out of his way to protect a Navy SEAL member who'd been accused of committing war crimes. And what kind of man did the president upend the military code of justice for?
"The guy is freaking evil," one fellow SEAL told investigators, referring to Special Operations chief Edward Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with the corpse of a teenage boy who'd been killed in his custody. After the presidential intervention, the formerly shamed serviceman was posing at Mar-a-Lago.
On any given day, Trump is vindictive, ignorant, narcissistic, a fraud - well, his pathologies are well known. But it's time to apply the same word to him as the brave Navy man did to the renegade in his unit. Under Trump, the United States is a confederacy of corruption, driven by a thousand points of evil. And that evil is contagious.
We all grew up hearing an ageless warning about public morality: that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.
The presumed outcome is reassuring, a story we tell ourselves. But in the last three years, that homily has been proven right, in the country where it was not supposed to happen. The Trump presidency has shown just how many ostensibly good people will do nothing, and how evil, when given a free rein at the top, trickles down.
When Trump retweeted a Photoshopped image of the two most important Democratic leaders of Congress dressed in Islamic garb in front of the Iranian flag, there was no chorus of condemnation from his side. Here was a graphic lie, a cheap defamation, the kind of dirty little trick that politicians usually give to the felon operating under the radar. For Trump, it was just another Monday.
Was it politics, or evil, when candidate Trump smeared a Gold Star family in 2016? Was it a mere shift in public policy, or evil, when Trump allowed people acting in our name to put children in cages and separate them from their mothers?
Was it mere theatrics to revel in a chant of "Lock her up," about Hillary Clinton, who has now been exonerated, twice, by federal investigators? Was it normal for the 44th successor of a president who could not tell a lie, to lie more than 15,000 times?
Trump has so desensitized us that a day without a round of blunt force cruelty from the White House is newsworthy. And now it all comes to a boil in the impeachment trial. The facts are not in dispute: Trump tried to force a struggling democracy into doing his political dirty work for him. He tried to squeeze a foreign power into meddling in our election. What is very much in doubt is whether enough good people will do something.
In the process of this high crime, Trump broke the law, as a nonpartisan congressional watchdog reported Thursday. The greater evil is the violation of the lofty purpose written into this country's founding documents. The smaller evils are the Republican senators who know the president violated his oath and deserves to be impeached but don't have the guts to say so.
"Do not, as my party did, underestimate the evil, desperate nature of evil, desperate people," writes Rick Wilson, the Republican operative and witty Never-Trumper, in "Running Against the Devil," his new book. "There is no bottom. There is no shame. There are no limits."
As for the contagion of evil, you need not look far. In Texas this month, Gov. Greg Abbott said his state would become the first to refuse to take in even a small number of legal, fully vetted refugees. These are people who've been approved by the federal government for asylum, after being displaced by war, famine or persecution. In the past, people from Vietnam, Cuba and Africa have been welcomed, and have gone on to become some of our finest citizens.
A handful of citizens, the Catholic Church, some members of Congress, objected. "Accepting refugees with open arms - giving without keeping score - is who we are as Americans," tweeted Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., herself an immigrant.
Sorry, that's not who we are as Americans in the Trump era. When the hate flag is flying, most of Trump's followers have stood up and saluted.
Here's the two-step that all good people must take now: First, realize the level of depravity that has taken over the White House, and second, fight accordingly.
"Do not come to this fight believing that the Trump team views any action, including outright criminality, as off limits," writes Wilson. This doesn't mean you have to cheat, lie, or coerce. But it means you do have to fight, or be counted among the do-nothings who allowed evil to flourish.

Texto completo: RICHMOND - A second attempt by gun rights groups to lift the firearms ban around Capitol Square for Monday's rally was denied Friday.
Gun Owners of America and the Virginia Citizens Defense League - the primary organizer of Monday's rally that is expected to draw thousands of people to Richmond - filed a lawsuit Thursday saying Gov. Ralph Northam didn't have the authority to ban guns on Capitol grounds. After a hearing held that same day, a Richmond Circuit Court judge ruled against the groups, and they appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court a few hours later.
Supreme Court justices said Friday night they didn't have enough information to make a ruling on whether to consider the appeal.
"The circuit court decided this case in less than one day, and, accordingly, the record before the (Supreme) Court is scant, there is no transcript or written statement of facts detailing the events of the hearing, and we are unaware of any evidence that was taken," justices wrote in their ruling.
David Browne, a lawyer for the gun rights groups, said the ban violated rally-goers' Second Amendment rights and raised "concerns" about First Amendment rights. He argued having a gun at a rally was a form of symbolic speech.
Toby Heytens, the state's solicitor general, argued the ban didn't prevent anyone from assembling, speaking or petitioning their government, and said simply carrying a gun isn't considered free speech.
Northam on Wednesday declared a state of emergency and issued the temporary ban on all weapons at Capitol Square, saying public safety officials had found credible threats of violence targeted for Monday's rally.
Public safety officials briefed the leadership in the state legislature Friday afternoon on the threats they say they've learned of ahead of Monday's gun rally.
The secure briefing for Senate and House leaders in both parties came after GOP leadership wrote Northam a letter Thursday requesting a meeting.
"Considering the abridgment of the constitutional rights of Virginians your declaration has imposed, and because we have serious concerns about whether a governor has the authority to enact such restrictions, we believe it is imperative that leaders of the General Assembly - representing both majority and minority caucuses - are appropriately briefed as to the nature of these threats," GOP leaders wrote.
House minority leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah, and caucus chair Kathy Byron, R-Bedford, had planned to attend, according to the party's spokesman. Senate Republicans and Democrats didn't respond to The Virginian-Pilot's questions about whether they would attend. A spokesman for House Democrats said he couldn't confirm the speaker and majority leader's attendance.
The House and Senate clerks were also invited.
Northam said on Wednesday that out-of-state militia and hate groups planned on attending the rally. Many are expected to protest a slew of bills backed by Northam, including universal background checks on firearm sales and limiting sales to one handgun a month.
The New York Times reported Thursday FBI officials arrested three suspected members of a neo-Nazi hate group amid allegations they planned to travel to the rally Monday.
Philip Van Cleave, head of the VCDL, said he expects between 50,000 and 120,000 people to attend. He said 37 buses are arriving at around 8 a.m. Monday from various Virginia cities.

Aboriginal way: Fight fire with fire Preventive burning has cut blazes, carbon emissions

Texto completo: COOINDA, Australia - At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match.
In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year - literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.
Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country's cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40%.
These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana.
"Fire is our main tool," Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. "It's part of protecting the land."
The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe.
"The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having indigenous people look after their lands," said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. "Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science."
In some ways, the aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.
But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.
Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country's thinly populated north, where aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents' concerns about the health effects of smoke.
The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces and the distinctive seasons - a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains - make burning more predictable.
Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country.
"We most certainly should learn to burn aboriginal-style," said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. "Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what aboriginal people could do."
Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals.
The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry.
"We don't have a fear of fire," said Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. "We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have."
This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas.
NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of pingpong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.
Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is long-standing: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of aboriginal methods.
The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and '90s when aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government.
Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings.
"The land was out of control," said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions.
The aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions.
According to calculations by Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57% fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started.
Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 aboriginal rangers, part time and full time.
"We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices," Yibarbuk said. "There's a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference."

Texto completo: COOINDA, Australia - At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match.
In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year - literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.
Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country's cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40%.
These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana.
"Fire is our main tool," Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. "It's part of protecting the land."
The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe.
"The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having indigenous people look after their lands," said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. "Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science."
In some ways, the aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.
But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.
Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country's thinly populated north, where aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents' concerns about the health effects of smoke.
The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces and the distinctive seasons - a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains - make burning more predictable.
Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country.
"We most certainly should learn to burn aboriginal-style," said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. "Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what aboriginal people could do."
Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals.
The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry.
"We don't have a fear of fire," said Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. "We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have."
This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas.
NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of pingpong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.
Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is long-standing: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of aboriginal methods.
The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and '90s when aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government.
Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings.
"The land was out of control," said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions.
The aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions.
According to calculations by Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57% fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started.
Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 aboriginal rangers, part time and full time.
"We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices," Yibarbuk said. "There's a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference."

It's 'love at first sight' Art collector finds inspiration and connection in treasures of African culture and history

Texto completo: The white living room in Olusanya Ojikutu's home, with its soaring cathedral ceiling, is a temple to his traditional and contemporary African art. Sculptures bookend the sofa, paintings and prints decorate the walls, and the overall atmosphere is one of beauty, historic grandeur and repose.
Most of Ojikutu's sculptures are at least a century old, created for performances or rituals. "They served as intermediaries between the local people and their ancestors' spirits to make their lives better and protect them from evil forces in this world and beyond," he said.
Among the dozens of sculptures are a metal Kota reliquary guardian figure from Gabon, a wood Bamana Chi Wara headdress from Mali and a wood-fiber Bwa plank mask from Burkina Faso.
"African art has long been seen as a monolith, but it really has many different origins," said Ojikutu, who is also an artist. "It should be recognized as more nuanced and coming from the many countries on the continent. I try to show that expanse of art forms and visual cultures in my collection."
Ojikutu, 50, of Nigeria, immigrated to the United States in the mid-1990s. He and his wife, Yinka, both work in technology and live with their two teenage sons in a Washington suburb.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Q: Why is it important to have connections to the art you collect?
The connection I feel toward any piece I buy, own or display is almost always love at first sight. Typically it's a numinous experience; the work speaks to me. I feel this instant visual attraction followed by an unconscious burst of inspiration.
Ile-Ife (Nigeria), where I went to university, is considered the ancestral home of the Yoruba and the legendary birthplace of the gods and humankind, so I have a natural connection to Yoruba history, art and culture because it's my personal history.
I also feel a connection when I buy artists I know. Like Victor Ehikhamenor, who happens to be my friend. I bought "No Man Is an Island" (2018). If you look closely, you see small black figures and faces embedded in the large silhouette. The paradigm he presents viewers is, "There are people within you and behind you and in front of you." It's all about connections.

Q: The timespan between early African art and contemporary art is wide. Do artists today appreciate traditional African art?
Certainly I believe a handful do care about, study and are somewhat influenced by African art, particularly masks. And I feel I'm following in the footsteps of artists like Gauguin, Picasso, Modigliani, Klee, Matisse and, more recently, Bacon and Basquiat, who were emotionally connected to and influenced by traditional African art.

Q: Was there a trigger moment to your collecting?
I think there were two.
A long time ago, an artist friend, Dapo Ojoade, wanted me to look at a colorfully painted flat wood sculpture he made. So I went to his house and said, "I love it. I want it." That was the first catalyst.
Then in 2016, I attended the auction of the art estate of Merton D. Simpson. He was the most prominent African American dealer of African art and he was a painter himself. I thought, "I want to do what he has done."

This yellow painting is redolent of El Anatsui.
It is by El Anatsui, painted in the 1980s. The adinkra motifs are considered a precursor to his majestic tapestries.

The crown on this caryatid resembles the African American museum on the National Mall.
The crown's shape was the inspiration for David Adjaye's design of the museum.
I have a profound connection to the museum because I participated in the Middle Passage exhibit. The exhibitors wanted a mix of authentic voices to reenact the anguish and suffering of slaves crossing the Atlantic. I contributed the Yoruba voice.

Q: How do you share your collection?
Yinka and I organize a yearly salon in a Gertrude Stein kind of way in the lower level of our house. That's where our photo collection is - pictures by Andrew Dosunmu, Zak Ové, George Osodi, Barthélémy Toguo, J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere - many of my paintings and Nok terra cotta, a fragile fired-clay sculpture from sometime between 500 B.C. to 200 A.D.
We invite people over to talk about art. We make sure you feel comfortable and that when you leave you see African art as beautiful and as conversation pieces that inspire thoughtful concentration to be fully appreciated.

Texto completo: FORT WORTH, Texas - Aubrey Lane was flying from Phoenix to New York when the man next to her started ordering multiple drinks at once.
As he became intoxicated, he started to make inappropriate comments to Lane, according to a federal lawsuit she filed against American Airlines in October 2018. At one point, he grabbed her face and kissed her, a witness said in an email to the airline.
"She would push him off and say that 'couldn't happen,' " the witness said.
After ordering four vodkas and two beers, the man was visibly drunk. He got up to go to the bathroom. Lane, taking the opportunity to also get up, went to the bathroom.
The man forced himself into the bathroom with Lane and raped her, she said in the lawsuit.
Sexual assault on airplanes is a growing problem, according to data from the FBI. But no one seems to know how much of a problem it is.
"It's definitely not getting better," said Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, an organization that represents airline passengers. "If there aren't reforms, I think it'll get worse."
According to the FBI - the leading agency for investigating misconduct in the air - in-flight sexual assaults rose from 2014 to 2017. In fiscal year 2014, 38 cases of in-flight sexual assault were reported to the FBI.
In the 2017 fiscal year, that number increased to 63. Reported assaults dropped to 39 in the 2018 fiscal year, The New York Times reported.
In June 2018, the FBI said the number of sexual assaults reported during commercial airline flights was increasing, and the number of actual cases could be higher than those reported.
However, more recent data and details on in-flight sexual misconduct are difficult to obtain.
The Star-Telegram requested investigative reports on sexual assault on planes, statistics on the number of sexual assaults reported and data on those assaults through the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI denied the request, citing rules that a federal agency does not have to create records or conduct research on requested data.
Hudson said the FBI has denied the group's requests for data for several years.
"They know how many investigations they did, they know how many prosecutions they had," Hudson said. "Their answer is, 'It's not in the standard database, so we can't help you.' "
Hudson said the increase in overnight flights, long-distance flights and flight attendants over-serving passengers alcohol increase the likelihood of sexual misconduct in the air.
He also said the FBI does not prioritize the assaults.
"They're organized to deal with white collar, organized crime, terrorism, things of that nature," he said.
Every day, 44,000 flights carry 2.7 million airline passengers across the world, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
If one of those passengers is assaulted or harassed, they have no official avenue to report the incident. A passenger might tell a flight attendant what happened, who may report it to the captain, who might tell a ground supervisor, who then may or may not report it to the police department of where the plane lands.
And then maybe the FBI will look into it.
"You have a four- or five-step process to get a proper investigation," Hudson said. "In most cases, nothing occurs. Through those steps, the plane has landed, people have left and the possibility for proper investigation, much less prosecution, is gone."
Unlike many industries, airlines do not have a legal mandate to report criminal activity, such as sexual assault.
Cruise lines, for example, became required to report crimes to the FBI with the passage of the Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010.
But for airplanes, "there is no singular definition of sexual misconduct, there is no federal or national definition, there is not mandate for reporting," said Sunitha Menon, chief of consulting services operations at the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network.
A lack of a reporting process also means a lack of data, Menon said, and no comprehensive way to track the issue.
Menon and 13 others are working to change that.
In October 2018, President Donald Trump signed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, which established a task force assigned to examine the problem.
The National In-Flight Sexual Misconduct Task Force consists of 14 members from varying backgrounds and groups. Menon is one of them - other members include airline representatives, Department of Justice directors and labor organization leaders. The group started meeting once a month in April 2018.
"People sit in planes and talk to people next to them without even knowing who they are," Menon said. "(Assault) doesn't happen frequently, but we want to make sure that when it does, the individual is supported in a holistic and victim-center way."

Texto completo: In her way, Mattie Gray helped bring a bit of the civil rights movement to a Long Island hospital 50 years ago.
In 1970, Gray was a worker in the dietary department of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset when workers decided they wanted to hold a celebration for the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. The sentiment built to the point where the cooks threatened to call in sick that day if it didn't happen, Gray recalled Friday.
The hospital acquiesced, and Gray helped prepare the commemoration of the civil rights leader, who had been assassinated only two years before.
On Friday, Gray returned to the hospital and recalled that moment of resistance during the 50th anniversary MLK celebration. 
"That was the first program - you see how it started and how sweet it was," said Gray, 82, a former Great Neck resident who now lives in Georgia. She added, "We were doing something to respect his effort, and bring people together."
When the workers got the go-ahead for a ceremony, Gray worked with head cook Robert (Bob) McGhee to prepare it. They had only a day to get everything ready. Gray had a record player and McGhee came over to her house to transfer excerpts from a record of King's speeches onto a tape.
"We stayed up till 2 in the morning getting it together," Gray said. During the ceremony attended by about 20 workers, people walked into the room and heard the booming voice of the civil rights icon.
"It was like he was here in the flesh," she said. "There were some tears, some hugs."
Friday's ceremony, where Gray received a standing ovation and a big bunch of flowers, was a stark reminder of how times have changed. This time, the ceremony was held in the hospital's big auditorium with several hundred people hearing speeches from the hospital's top brass as well as performances by the Uniondale High School Show Choir and Grammy-winning violinist Miri Ben-Ari.
Gray was humble about her own contribution, giving the lion's share of credit to McGhee.
"I know Reverend King would be happy to know Bob planted a seed and it has spread wide," she said. "It started very small and it ended very large."
The day brought to mind Gray's own upbringing in Alabama, where segregation was widespread and brutally enforced. She said she's seen so much change for the better in her lifetime, but that more needs to occur.
"A lot of people don't want to move," she said.
Her message was simple:
"Keep marching."
The ceremony also featured a talk by author Michael Eric Dyson, a Georgetown University sociology professor and opinion writer for The New York Times. 
"We have to unlock the power of diversity," Dyson said. "You'd be surprised what you can learn from people you think you're better than."
Delving into King's message of brotherhood, Dyson echoed one of King's memorable sentiments.
"If we do not love each other and reach out to one another, we will perish as fools," he

The Comey Coverup Unravels

Texto completo: In a curious report on Thursday evening, the New York Times carefully averts its eyes from everything that's interesting. Even Adam Schiff has acknowledged that James Comey's actions in 2016 may represent the most important and significant Russian influence on the election. (Hoist your shot glass. This will be the umpteenth time I've quoted Mr. Schiff on this matter in this column.)
Surely one of the most consequential pieces of intelligence ever received by U.S. agencies was, as we now learn, received in early 2016 from a Dutch counterpart. This is the dubious Russian intelligence that set off Mr. Comey's multiple interventions in the last presidential race, culminating in an improper act that may have inadvertently elected Donald Trump. Even at the time Mr. Comey's FBI colleagues considered the intelligence, which indicated questionable actions by the Justice Department to fix the Hillary email investigation, to be false, possibly a Russian plant.
The Times adds the unsurprising revelation that Mr. Comey himself is suspected in the illegal leak that, in early 2017, alerted the media to this untold aspect of his 2016 actions, before the matter disappeared again behind a veil of official secrecy. Yet bizarrely, the paper plays down its scoop, suggesting that any inquiry into a "years-old" leak now can only be a political hit job by an "ambitious" Justice Department attorney seeking to please President Trump.
First of all, I doubt this subject pleases Mr. Trump -- it re-raises the question of whether his election was an accident caused by Mr. Comey. Second, the information is obviously important. The scandal hiding in plain sight is our intelligence establishment's misuse of its authority to muck around in the 2016 election.
As a bonus, I'm going to suggest the FBI's own pursuit of the collusion will-o'-the-wisp may have been occasioned by its hope of finding that the same fabricated Russian intelligence was in the hands of the Trump campaign, providing an ex post justification for Mr. Comey's actions that he desperately would have wanted once fingers began pointing at him for Mrs. Clinton's defeat. (I guess we can at least be glad he didn't plant the information on Carter Page.)
Let's call a spade a spade. The media is a big part of the coverup. When the Justice Department inspector general issued his damning report on Mr. Comey, not one media outlet in the Factiva database told its readers about the existence of its classified appendix except this column and Britain's Daily Mail tabloid.
Mr. Comey himself, after allegedly leaking the secret information to the press, penned a sententious memoir suggesting the same info should remain hidden from the American people "decades from now."
And while flogging fake revelations from the nonexistent Trump-Russia conspiracy, the mainstream press ignored a public plea, uttered before Congress, by the Justice Department's own inspector general that the secret Comey information be declassified so the people and their representatives can know the truth about 2016.
On Thursday night, former Rep. Trey Gowdy reported that the information Mr. Comey is suspected of leaking to the media he refused to share even with Congress in a classified briefing, saying it was too top secret.
The mainstream media has been uncharacteristically silent about all this for too long -- and you're about to find out why. Whether from design or myopia, it allowed itself to be instrumental in suppressing real news in favor of a fairy tale about Mr. Trump and the Russians. That's the deeper message of the Times's weirdly conflicted handling of its scoop about Mr. Comey.
Leaking secret intelligence, if that's what Mr. Comey did, is a crime. But even more palpable is something else: The information remains officially classified not to protect national security but to protect the national-security establishment from embarrassment.
The story here truly contains something for everybody. If you think Mr. Trump never should have been president, blame Mr. Comey. If you think the "deep state" is running amok, here's your evidence. If you think the intelligence establishment is incompetent and needs a Trumpian kick in the derriere, even more so.
Alas, every revelation about this matter turns out to be a revelation also about the deviousness and expediency of Mr. Comey, the nation's former FBI director. What should happen now? More than ever, Attorney General William Barr should act on the authority Mr. Trump has given him and declassify the inspector general's report as well any material describing the role of other agencies (e.g., the CIA) in Mr. Comey's election-meddling escapades.

Texto completo: As the nation celebrates the birth of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the progressive left will again seize the moment to twist the story of black Americans' struggle, to the detriment of those who suffered most in that struggle. They'll put all the attention on the oppressive conditions faced by black freedom fighters -- what white racists did to them -- rather than on their own spirit in fighting to gain equal rights under the law. Instead of celebrating blacks' achievements and the progress made toward delivering on America's promissory note, the left will transport yesterday's real injustices into today's false social-justice narrative, ignoring the principles that were so crucial to Dr. King.
History is full of inspiring examples of black people succeeding against the odds, including building their own schools, hotels, railroads and banking systems when doors were closed to them. According to the economist Thomas Sowell, "the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960."
These accomplishments were made possible by a set of values cherished among the blacks of the time: self-determination, resiliency, personal virtue, honesty, honor and accountability. Dr. King understood that these values would be the bedrock for black success once true equality was won. As early as 1953, he warned that "one of the most common tendencies of human nature is that of placing responsibility on some external agency for sins we have committed or mistakes we have made."
Today the progressive left wants to ignore the achievements and pretend that blacks are perpetual victims of white racism. The New York Times's "1619 Project" essay series is the latest salvo in this attack on America's history and founding, claiming "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." This statement is an abomination of everything Dr. King stood for. Further, the left's disinterest in historical accuracy -- as evinced in the Times's dismissal of corrections sought by prominent historians -- and its frequent perversion of blacks' story will have grave consequences not only for blacks but the nation as a whole.
In sharp contrast to the claims of the "1619 Project" -- which disparages the American Revolution and Declaration of Independence and insists America is hopelessly racist -- Dr. King believed deeply in the need to remain true to the Founders' vision, the "patriot dream that sees beyond the years." To him, that was the only avenue toward fulfilling America's promise. As he wrote in his 1963 "Letter From a Birmingham Jail":
"One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
"We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation," he wrote, "because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny."
Dr. King, who sought full participation in America, would never have indulged today's grievance-based identity politics, whose social-justice warriors use race as a battering ram against the country. In fact, in "Letter From a Birmingham Jail" Dr. King explicitly warned against the type of groupthink that characterizes identity politics: "Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals."
Yesterday's values prepared blacks to walk through the doors of opportunity opened to them through civil rights. Family, faith, character and moral behavior were all crucial to their victories. Today's social-justice warriors trade on the currency of oppression, deriding the concept of personal responsibility and always blaming external forces. I can think of no better way to instill hopelessness and fear in a young person than to tell him he is a victim, powerless to change his circumstance.
During the civil-rights movement blacks never permitted oppression to define who we were. Instead we cultivated moral competence, enterprise and thrift, and viewed oppression as a stumbling block, not an excuse.
Dr. King would have refused to participate in today's identity politics gamesmanship because it frames its grievances in opposition to the American principles of freedom and equality that he sought to redeem. He upheld the country's founding principles and sought to destroy only what got in the way of delivering the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the recognition that all men are created equal.
Last month the school board of Westfield, N.J., approved a history course on critical race theory, which is the embodiment of the oppressor narrative embraced by the left. At the board meeting a young woman spoke passionately in favor of the course, ending her comments by blaming slavery for the absence of black fathers in the home. This is how successful the left, with its lethal message of despair and distortion of history, has been at undermining agency within the black community.
To honor the legacy of Dr. King, we must not only acknowledge the evil he confronted, but also focus on his example in overcoming it. He persevered and triumphed in the face of evil because he was beholden to truth, honor and love for all mankind, driven as he was to see blacks share fully in the American dream. We must not let the purveyors of identity politics fudge the record: Martin Luther King Jr. believed in the promise of America. In fact, he helped to fulfill it.

Texto completo: As we approach Super Bowl weekend, the closest thing America has to a national cultural festival, I'm struck that one of the great pleasures and puzzles of life for an immigrant here is the nature of sports and their primacy in the national consciousness.
Few things capture the notion of American exceptionalism as well as its team sports. Take professional leagues first: None of the major pro sports here -- football, baseball, basketball or hockey -- is played to anything like the same level outside North America.
This always induces some supercilious snickering among foreigners. The notion, for example, that prevailing among the 29 U.S. and one Canadian teams each year on the baseball diamond confers the title of "World Champions" seems a classic case of American epistemic isolationism. It would be like calling that entertainingly ridiculous English rustic activity where border collies herd reluctant woolly livestock into pens the Sheepdog Trials World Series.
Some at this point will raise cricket. But while only a handful of countries may play the game, those nations account for about a quarter of the world's population. So when the winner of cricket's international competition calls itself "World Champion," it means something. (It's currently England, by the way, as I'm sure you knew.)
Individual sports have always been different. Americans have excelled internationally at golf, tennis and Olympic events, but somehow, in team effort, the U.S. doesn't play well with others.
Basketball, it's true, has an increasingly global reach. Next week, the Milwaukee Bucks, currently the top team in the NBA, who boast as their star player a young man from Athens (Greece, not Georgia), will play a regular season game in Paris. But this is still an American team playing in an American league, albeit by and for foreigners.
Soccer, as Americans insist on calling football, is the global game sans pareil. America's repeated attempts to excel at an international level have been of limited success (except for the very talented women) and seem to be going nowhere.
But the most powerful and enduring feature of U.S. athletic exceptionalism is surely college sports, a uniquely American phenomenon. There cannot be a place on Earth where so much money is spent in pursuit of the amateur ideal.
England does have its annual Boat Race. But in a prime example of entrenched national elitism, only two universities, Oxford and Cambridge, are allowed to compete for it. The crews themselves are largely made up of Americans in their seventh year of graduate work in agronomy or applied social-media studies who also happen to be Olympic gold medalists. And while the race on the Thames is nationally televised, rights go for about the price of a season ticket to the University of Alabama's football games.
It's easy to be cynical about college sports: the money, the hypocrisy around supposed amateurism, the dubious academic status of some of the athletes, the privileges they enjoy.
Just this week, that cynicism was on display when a New York Times staffer tweeted about how absurd it was that Louisiana State University called off classes for two days during the national football championship (which LSU won). It was no use pointing out that the university was simply adding the two days on to the end of this semester. The metropolitan elitism that looks down from the august heights of Ivy League self-esteem on the centrality of athletic programs to so many colleges is quite entrenched.
I too was once a little cynical. Isn't higher education about elevating the mind? Doesn't all the money and attention paid to college sports skew perceptions and priorities?
But I've seen it up close in the past decade through my daughters, and I must say that the unique nature of college sports to American culture is a critical part of its success.
Of course, the billions of dollars that college sport generates helps make American higher education the best funded in the world. And what's wrong with exposing disadvantaged young people, who take many of the athletic scholarships, to the academic experience?
Above all, there is the idealism and esprit de corps that sport engenders. To a European mind, clouded by post-idealistic cynicism, rooting for your college is impossibly crass. But college spirit helps many Americans develop a powerful sense of community and belonging. God knows that's needed in our atomistic and hyperpartisan world.

CNN'S SHAMEFUL TREATMENT OF BERNIE SANDERS THE VERMONT SENATOR FACES A FAMILIAR CHALLENGE

Texto completo: What CNN did to Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic presidential debate - stabbing him with the gender card on behalf of a weakened Elizabeth Warren - was cheap and unfair.
And it was shameful.
I'm probably the last guy to defend Mr. Sanders. He is a man of the far left and I most certainly am not.
But even a conservative like me can see that Mr. Sanders was cheated out of the Democratic presidential nomination the last time, with the Democratic National Committee rigging the whole thing for Hillary Clinton. And now it's happening again.
No wonder the Sanders supporters are angry.
What happened on CNN in Iowa was bad for journalism. But it sure was good for Ms. Warren and Joe Biden.
Mr. Sanders, the authentic candidate on the left in this cycle, as he was in the last, was surging in the Iowa polls. Ms. Warren, also on the left, was fading, desperate and in full panic. She began waving her gender card on that dangerous Intersectionality Highway where Democrats, addicted to identity politics, often crack up.
Just before the debate, CNN ran a story portraying Mr. Sanders as misogynist who thinks a woman couldn't be elected president. That's ridiculous. He doesn't believe that.
And at the CNN debate, moderator Abby Phillip took Ms. Warren's gender card, fashioned it into a knife and stabbed Mr. Sanders just weeks before the Iowa caucuses.
"Sen. Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Sen. Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?" Ms. Phillip asked of Mr. Sanders.
"Well," Mr. Sanders said, "as a matter of fact, I didn't say it.
"I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want," Mr. Sanders added. "Anybody who knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States.
"Go to YouTube today," Mr. Sanders said. "There's a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States."
Ms. Phillip asked it again. And again, Mr. Sanders denied he ever said it. Ms. Phillip turned to Ms. Warren.
"Sen. Warren, what did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?" Ms. Warren was asked.
Excuse me? Mr. Sanders just denied it. But Ms. Phillip didn't ask Ms. Warren if Mr. Sanders was telling the truth.
Instead, Ms. Phillip repeated the Warren camp accusation as fact.
And this is how votes are herded.
Ms. Warren said she disagreed with Mr. Sanders, adding sweetly, "Bernie is my friend and I am not here to try and fight with Bernie."
What a phony. He's your friend? Of course, he is. Who doesn't engineer the public stabbing of their friends?
Before Mr. Sanders was shivved, Democratic establishment candidate Biden looked lost and frail and unsure.
Mr. Biden was like some elderly Uncle Joe retiree in line at 4 p.m. for the early bird dinner with the free Jell-O.
But who remembers that after Ms. Warren pointedly refused to shake her "friend" Bernie's hand? Mr. Biden wasn't even touched by CNN's debate moderators. His questions were wrapped in pillows.
You might think all this is a coincidence, but then, you might be a moron. And you're not a moron. Trust me.
And it's no wonder Mr. Sanders' supporters are upset. They've seen this before. They watched the same game play out three years ago, when the Democratic nomination was almost his, and establishment media handmaidens of the Democratic National Committee protected Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr. Trump.
A Sanders vs. Trump campaign in 2016 would have been a clash of populist titans. Mr. Sanders could have won. We might see this matchup in 2020. Establishment Democrats are panicked, and conventional wisdom suggests Mr. Trump would smash him, but I'm not so sure.
The electorate has been primed by relentless media attacks on Mr. Trump, who attacks them back. Americans are unsettled and worried about their future in a world undergoing economic upheaval. Bernie could win.
I disagree with Mr. Sanders' policies, but at least he's honest about what he wants to do. Establishment Democrats see Mr. Sanders' base as full of energy and know they must stop him in Iowa and New Hampshire.
They feed Ms. Warren so Mr. Sanders doesn't defeat Mr. Biden. And they'll use friendly media to shape a stiletto and slip it between Bernie's ribs.
Sanders' voters have seen this one before.

AJC LOCAL IN-DEPTH DOMESTIC TERRORISM: Police: 3 men held in plot to start race war: White supremacists planned to kill Bartow couple, officials say.

Texto completo: Authorities in North Georgia said they have arrested three men who belong to a white supremacist organization that was plotting to kill a Bartow County couple, overthrow the government and start a race war.
Floyd County police allege the three are members of "the Base," described as a violent organization that has a substantial presence south of Rome in the rural Silver Creek community. The group's goal, police said, is to "establish a white ethno-state."
The men -- Michael John Helterbrand, 25, of Dalton; Jacob Kaderli, 19, of Dacula; and Luke Austin Lane, 21, of Silver Creek -- plotted in North Georgia last year with a fourth member of the same group, a Canadian national named Patrick Jordan Mathews, according to Floyd police.
Federal law enforcement authorities arrested Mathews, a former combat engineer in the Canadian Army Reserve, and two other Base members in Maryland and charged them with firearm-related offenses this week. Mathews had discussed participating in a pro-gun rally Monday in Richmond, Va., where state lawmakers are considering gun control measures, The New York Times reported. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam instituted a temporary ban on firearms on Capitol grounds ahead of the rally, citing intelligence that extremist groups were threatening violence.A Virginia Circuit Court judge upheld the order in a ruling Thursday.
The rally has drawn support from far-right groups, including the Georgia III% Security Force militia, led by Chris Hill, an Atlanta-area resident. Hill, who has spent months publicizing the rally on his social media channels, apparently is in Richmond for the event. On Friday, Hill posted a news account of the Base arrests on Facebook, saying: "FBI Just Arrested 3 Men That Were Headed to The Virginia Rally" and called the accusations "fake."
The three Georgians have each been charged with participating in a criminal gang and conspiracy to commit murder. Jail records do not identify any attorneys representing them.
"The group was involved in recruiting new members online, meeting to discuss strategy and practicing in paramilitary training camps on a 100-acre tract in Silver Creek," Floyd police said
in a news release.
The case is detailed in a 20-page affidavit
Floyd police released
Friday. It describes how an undercover FBI agent infiltrated the group last year. He met with some of its members on the Lane family's sprawling property in Silver Creek and participated in shooting drills to prepare for what the group calls the "Boogaloo," or the collapse of the United States and a race war.
Lane is identified in the affidavit as using the online alias "TMB." Archived records show TMB was a regular poster on neo-Nazi forums.On one, he described his journey from libertarian-leaning Republican to radical neo-Nazi.
"I was always (National Socialist) but never knew it, so that is probably why I skipped around in fringeyish circles looking for the truth I knew existed somewhere," he wrote.
In another meeting attended by the undercover agent, Mathews -- who "crossed into the United States illegally -- was there, the affidavit said. Later, the agent observed Helterbrand, Kaderli and Lane discuss plans to kill an unnamed, married Bartow couple who they believed belong to the Atlanta Antifascists.The agent accompanied Kaderli and Lane as they surveilled the couple's home and surrounding neighborhood.
Atlanta Antifascists, an anonymous group that researches and exposes white supremacists online, released a statement to the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that said the couple was not a member of its group. But the group said such plots are not unexpected.
"Targeting people as members of our group has become a favorite pastime of violent white supremacists," the statement said, adding the Base is trying "to create a general attitude of terror and paranoia."
A neo-Nazi group that has been active online since it emerged in 2018, the Base portrays its members as "soldiers defending the European race against a system that is infected by Jewish values," said Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism.
"This is a continuation of the threat of domestic terrorism that I think people are really wrapping their heads around finally," Segal said. "To some degree, we have seen law enforcement talk about sort of doubling down on efforts to track this deadly threat. And maybe now we are starting to see some of the outcomes of that focus."

Texto completo: The perils of reporting with a fancy new recorder.
"The Daily" asks a lot of our newsroom colleagues. Take Ben Dooley, our guest on Tuesday's show about the fugitive businessman Carlos Ghosn, who escaped house arrest in Tokyo and emerged, a free man, in Beirut.
During the holiday break, we'd heard that Ben was in discussions with Ghosn's representatives about interviewing him in Beirut, a journalistic coup.
Our first request to Ben? Purchase a high-quality recorder before he left Japan. Ben had an old phone with a so-so internal recorder. We figured his interview with Ghosn would become central to the episode we had in mind and wanted the best possible audio.
His new recorder in hand (a Zoom H4N, for audiophiles), Ben flew to Beirut and carried out our second request: to record his journey and his experience on the ground there. Ben did just that, capturing the sounds of himself boarding planes, entering Lebanon and arriving at Ghosn's crowded news conference, all of which were incorporated into the episode.
Then came the third request: Record his one-on-one interview with Ghosn. Just before he walked into a conference room to introduce himself to Ghosn, Ben started recording. Or so he thought.
"There were a lot of buttons," Ben told us. "Unfortunately, when it came to the key moment, I pressed the wrong one."
The Zoom H4N never ended up recording the interview. But, in a heroic turn, Ben had used his cellphone recorder as a backup. That gave us an alternate version of the audio, albeit a less crisp one.
That brought us to our final request -- an interview with Ben that would stitch together all the audio he'd captured and turn it into an episode. Ben had returned to Tokyo, which is 14 hours ahead of New York. He generously agreed to let us speak to him starting at 11 p.m. his time, staying on the line until well after midnight.
We couldn't resist a teasing reference to his audio troubles.
Ben: I tried to set up the fancy recorder you guys made me buy, and I messed it up. So we didn't get the whole interview, unfortunately.
Michael: We forgive you. It had been a long week.
Ben: It had been a long week.
In the end, the episode was a sound-rich journey through Ben's reporting and Ghosn's epic escape -- and a tribute to what our colleagues are willing to do to tell a great story in audio.

Here come the managers
Our producer Sydney Harper on what it was like to be at the U.S. Capitol with the congressional reporter Nicholas Fandos on Wednesday, when the seven House impeachment managers delivered the articles of impeachment to the Senate:
Security was tight at the Capitol that day, and we weren't allowed to follow the impeachment managers as they walked from the House to the Senate. We were told, instead, to pick a spot for the ceremonial transfer and just stay there. Our options were limited: Stand on the House side and watch them depart, saying, "There go the managers!" or stand on the Senate side and watch them approach, saying, "Here come the managers!" We went with the second option.
As a producer at the scene of a milestone moment like the one on Wednesday, you're operating within two headspaces. On the one hand, you have to focus on the sound. There I was, awkwardly crowding Nick Fandos with a 10-inch microphone while cameras clicked furiously around us -- a typical day in the life of a producer.
But it wasn't just a typical day. As much as I tried to keep my mind on doing my job, it hit me that this job had brought me to the doors of the Senate chamber, watching this moment play out before my eyes. I'd overheard a guard come across a young man with a congressional intern badge and make him promise not to engage in any "partisan shouting" as the articles of impeachment passed by. He assured the guard that he wouldn't. "I'm just witnessing history!" he said. I couldn't help but relate.

Monday: As wildfires devastate ecosystems across Australia, the prime minister is keeping climate change out of the conversation, Livia Albeck-Ripka reports.
Tuesday: "The great irony here is that he says he's searching for justice, but because of a decision that he made, he may never find it." Ben Dooley spoke with Carlos Ghosn after the businessman's escape from Tokyo.
Wednesday: Nicole Perlroth on what to expect from Russia this election cycle: There have "been no repercussions for Russian interference in 2016 -- at least not enough to keep them from doing the same thing all over again in 2020."
Thursday: The impeachment trial of President Trump has begun. Nick Fandos on what is likely to happen.

Texto completo: The White House is likely to propose the Secret Service return to Treasury, but an administration report warns of the damage that could do to the Homeland Security Department.
WASHINGTON -- President Trump's plan to move the Secret Service from the Department of Homeland Security back to the Treasury Department risks unraveling the cabinet agency responsible for securing the United States, according to a report issued by a group of government officials formed to study the move.
Since last year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has discussed taking control of the Secret Service with White House officials and, in recent weeks, members of Congress. James M. Murray, the Secret Service director, also recommended moving the agency back to Treasury, where it was housed until 2003, when the Department of Homeland Security was founded after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Officials from both agencies believe the move could improve investigations into financial crimes and provide more support for the Secret Service, since the Homeland Security Department under Mr. Trump has been increasingly focused on immigration.
But a working group of homeland security, Treasury and White House officials formed last year to examine the issue said that homeland security officials and lawmakers could "perceive" the "loss of the Secret Service" as leaving behind a "weakened D.H.S."
"Such a loss could open D.H.S. up to additional reforms or reorganizations, perhaps even some involving the transfer or dismantling of other operating components, further weakening the department at a critical time in its development," according to the report obtained by The New York Times.
The group said the administration must develop a plan to support the other agencies in the homeland security department.
The move could also hurt the department's efforts to protect the nation from threats to its computer networks, the group said in the report. In addition to protecting the president and his family, the Secret Service is also responsible for investigating financial crimes and currency counterfeiting.
The White House is planning to formally propose the move in its 2021 budget, which is expected to be released next month.
Recently, Mr. Mnuchin has been actively lobbying the Republicans and Democrats in Congress to back legislation needed to make the move. The effort hit a snag last year when Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, began pressing the Secret Service to produce reports detailing the cost of protecting the president, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Mnuchin supported the idea of such reports, but insisted that they not be released until after the 2020 election, these people said. The Trump administration was wary that such reports could give his opponents ammunition to criticize him for the exorbitant costs of his travel to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and to his golf clubs, hotels and other resorts.
Two administration officials said Ms. Feinstein had recently warmed to receiving the reports in December. A spokesman for Ms. Feinstein's office said negotiations with the administration were continuing.
The Department of Homeland Security did not return requests for comment. Catherine Milhoan, a spokeswoman for the Secret Service, said in a statement the agency "has been involved in discussions regarding the potential move and is appreciative of the active interest in advancing its integrated mission."
The Washington Post reported this month about Mr. Mnuchin's opposition to releasing the reports before the election.
The Trump administration had hoped that legislation for the move could have been attached to a year-end spending bill last year, since it is not clear that there would be sufficient congressional support for a stand-alone bill this year -- particularly without details about the costs associated with protecting Mr. Trump and his family.
"In the absence of getting that information you can only surmise that something must be amiss," said Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, "or at least you're trying to keep certain information away from members of congress."
Mr. Thompson said he opposed moving the Secret Service because it could harm national security.
The creation of the Homeland Security Department after the Sept. 11 attacks reorganized multiple government agencies and moved agencies with security functions, including the Secret Service, under one umbrella. The department also includes the Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration, and agencies responsible for immigration, border duties, hurricane relief and cybersecurity.
While some senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security have expressed concern about losing an agency with those investigative components, high-ranking Secret Service agents have long felt neglected by the department. The Secret Service represents only 3 percent of the budget of the Department of Homeland Security, an agency that now has its fifth leader under the Trump administration, Chad Wolf, an acting chief who has yet to be nominated for the secretary position.
The Homeland Security Department and its many agencies have become frequent targets of critics of Mr. Trump's immigration agenda. Democratic presidential candidates have proposed overhauling the department's border agency, and some Democrats have pushed for abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The working group also considered breaking up the Secret Service, according to the report, and sending the investigative branch to the Treasury Department while keeping the protective arm at the Homeland Security Department. Another proposal involved moving one branch of the Secret Service to the Treasury Department and the protective function to the Justice Department.
But agents have long held that the responsibilities are intertwined and splitting the agency would result in a lack of resources for the service. Officials in both the Treasury Department and the Secret Service are eager to move the Secret Service in its entirety, according to the report.
Mr. Mnuchin's fondness for the Secret Service has grown as he has bonded with his personal detail of agents, who often accompany him to SoulCycle sessions and on long bike rides from his estate to Mount Vernon, according to people familiar with his exercise regimen.

Texto completo: The rising star is accused of transporting the car to New York from Los Angeles. It was found outside his mother's Brooklyn home.
Pop Smoke was emerging last summer as one of the hottest young rappers from Brooklyn, scoring collaborations with artists like Travis Scott and Nicki Minaj.
Then, on Friday, hours before he was scheduled to perform at a concert in New York, he was arrested at Kennedy International Airport. He had just returned to New York from Paris Fashion Week.
In an odd plot twist to the meteoric rise of his music career, Pop Smoke, 20, is accused of stealing a black 2019 Rolls-Royce that he had borrowed for a music video in California, according to an indictment and a law enforcement official.
Investigators believe he arranged for the Rolls-Royce to be transported to New York City on the back of a flatbed truck, and then posted a photo on Instagram showing him in front of the stolen car, the official said. (The image has since been taken down from Instagram, but is still visible on Facebook.)
Pop Smoke, whose real name is Bashar Jackson, was charged with a crime rarely seen in a federal indictment: interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle. Pop Smoke pleaded not guilty to the single count on Friday.
The car is worth an estimated $ 375,000 and has since been returned to the owner, the law enforcement official said.
Last month, investigators found the Rolls-Royce parked outside the home of Pop Smoke's mother in the Canarsie area of Brooklyn, the official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a continuing investigation. The license plate had been changed and the windows had been tinted.
At a court hearing Friday, a federal prosecutor said the government believed that Pop Smoke was a member of a street gang affiliated with the Crips. The indictment does not accuse him of committing any violence.
The prosecutor, Gillian Kassner, said the rapper used at least six aliases and posed a risk of fleeing the country -- "not to mention," she said, "the alias he most commonly uses actually refers to leaving," a nod to his stage name, Pop Smoke.
Pop Smoke responded softly to the judge's questions, wearing a white hoodie with Mona Lisa's face on the front and striped green velour sweatpants. He was released on a $ 250,000 bond and is prohibited from traveling outside the United States without the government's permission.
He is also barred from any contact with gang members or with the owner of the Rolls-Royce.
Mark I. Cohen, a lawyer for Pop Smoke, declined to comment after the hearing.
With radio staples like "Welcome to the Party" and "Dior," the gravel-voiced Pop Smoke became one of the most promising rappers from Brooklyn's growing drill rap scene last year. His debut EP, "Meet the Woo," was released last July.
In October, Pop Smoke was one of five New York rappers that the New York Police Department prevented from performing at the Rolling Loud hip-hop festival in Queens, contending that they had been "affiliated with recent acts of violence citywide" but not specifying any criminal behavior.
A month later, he met the owner of the new Rolls-Royce at a recording studio in Los Angeles. The owner, whose identity was not revealed in the indictment, let the rapper borrow his car for a music video on the promise that it would be returned the day after, according to the law enforcement official.
When that day came, the official said, the owner was unable to reach Pop Smoke and tried figuring out the Rolls-Royce's location using the GPS tracking on the car. He saw that his Rolls-Royce was traveling through Arizona.
Days later, the official said, Pop Smoke posted the photo on Instagram with the Rolls-Royce in New York. Investigators eventually gathered evidence that indicated Pop Smoke had arranged for the car to be transported across the country on a truck.
This was not Pop Smoke's first run-in with law enforcement. About a year ago, he completed a diversion program set up by local prosecutors in Brooklyn for first-time offenders, according to a person familiar with the case. The program's participants are typically young people who face gun possession charges.
In an interview with The New York Times last year, Pop Smoke said he was kicked out of eighth grade for bringing a gun to school.
He said of his teenage years: "You like nice things, you got to do things to get nice things."
"At 16, I had a 5 Series," he said, referring to a BMW.
Pop Smoke had been scheduled to perform Friday night at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn at an annual tribute concert called Yams Day, which is expected to feature ASAP Rocky and other rappers.
Jon Caramanica and Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.

Weinstein Jury Chosen, and Prosecutors Say Defense Weeded Out White Women

Texto completo: The defense is "systematically eliminating every young white woman," a prosecutor said during jury selection.
Half of the 12 jurors selected this week in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein share something with him: They are white men; some well-heeled. A seventh is a black man. The remaining five are women.
But prosecutors raised one problem as the jury was picked. For a while, the panel had no white women, even though the majority of Mr. Weinstein's accusers are from that demographic. In the end, two white women were selected as the final two jurors, but only after the defense had run out of challenges.
"They are systematically eliminating every young white woman on this jury," the lead prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi, said in court on Thursday afternoon. She renewed the same protest vigorously on Friday, noting the defense had objected to "every single white woman."
The full jury was seated on Friday afternoon, ending an arduous two-week process and setting the stage for opening statements and testimony to start next week. Over the last two days, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers successfully used their right to reject a number of possible jurors for no reason to limit the white women on the panel, prosecutors said.
Ms. Illuzzi did not say in court why having few young white women on the jury would be problematic for the prosecution, but the district attorney's office appeared to be operating on the theory that such jurors were likely to be sympathetic to Mr. Weinstein's accusers.
The case against Mr. Weinstein hinges almost entirely on whether the jury believes two women who say that he sexually assaulted them, or accepts his lawyers' contention that the encounters were consensual. The accusers did not report the sexual assaults to law enforcement for years, and some kept in touch with Mr. Weinstein after the incidents.
Defense lawyers said their resistance to seating certain people had to do with their responses on a questionnaire, which, in their minds, raised doubts about whether the prospective jurors could be fair. Mr. Weinstein's lead lawyer, Donna Rotunno, said the challenges "had nothing to do with race or sex, frankly."
Prosecutors and criminal defense lawyers say that trials are often won or lost in jury selection, as lawyers for both sides maneuver to seat people they feel they can persuade.
The defense lawyers also sought to disqualify anyone who had been a victim of sexual assault or who knew someone who had been, greatly reducing the pool of women who might sit in judgment of their client.
The trial of Mr. Weinstein, the disgraced Hollywood producer, is one of the most anticipated proceedings in recent years. Allegations against him helped ignite the global #MeToo movement, a reckoning over sexual assault and harassment by powerful and influential men in the workplace.
Mr. Weinstein, 67, is charged with raping one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcing oral sex on a second woman in his Manhattan apartment in 2006. He is also charged with predatory sexual assault, which exposes Mr. Weinstein to a lifetime prison sentence.
Four other women will be called to testify about their allegations that Mr. Weinstein sexually assaulted them. Those incidents are too old to be charged as separate crimes, but prosecutors have won permission to bring them up in an effort to prove a pattern of behavior.
Mr. Weinstein has said that all the encounters were consensual.
Jury selection has been full of drama since it began last week. Hundreds of panelists immediately said they could not be fair and were dismissed. A flash mob protested Mr. Weinstein outside the courthouse. The supermodel Gigi Hadid popped up in the jury pool and was eventually excused.
One potential juror was dismissed after she said that she knew a woman who once had "an encounter" with the producer. The judge threatened to hold another prospective juror in contempt of the court after he had asked his nearly 7,000 social media followers how he might use a high-profile case to promote a new novel.
Despite what Mr. Weinstein has called in court papers a "carnival-like atmosphere," the jury and three alternates were chosen by 1 p.m. on Friday. The alternate jurors, who will serve only if one of the first 12 jurors must withdraw, include a white man, a Hispanic woman and black woman.
As both sides started picking jurors on Thursday, the judge overseeing the case, James M. Burke, acknowledged that many of the potential jurors had likely read about Mr. Weinstein. Still, he said, the goal was to find people who could set aside what they had read, be fair and judge the case solely on the evidence in the courtroom.
"This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement," Justice Burke said. "It is not a referendum on sexual harassment. It is not a referendum on women's rights." He added, "The sole issue is for you to decide whether or not the defendant committed certain acts, which constitute a particular crime, and decide whether or not the facts have been proven."
The 12 jurors include a public housing worker, an Upper East Side businessman, an East Harlem security guard, the managing partner of an investment firm, a banking executive, a married father of two, the co-founder of a start-up, a real estate tax accountant and a lawyer whose sister is a federal prosecutor in Chicago.
One of the two white women on the jury is a writer with an upcoming novel that describes relations between young women and "predatory" older men. Defense lawyers, who were out of challenges, argued that she should not serve because she had not revealed details about her book in her questionnaire.
"She was not forthcoming about the book, about the subject matter of the book, predatory older men," said Damon Cheronis, another of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers. "She lied under oath."
Prosecutors noted that she had said on her form she was a novelist. The defense asked for a mistrial over her inclusion, but Justice Burke denied the motion.
On Thursday, Mr. Weinstein's lawyers eliminated several white women from the jury pool, including one who had friends in college who had been sexually assaulted. Another said her mother had been physically and sexually abused; a third had written a book about women in the workplace and had friends in the entertainment industry; and a fourth had also written a book on women's issues.
Margaret Bull Kovera, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said the maneuvering by the defense and prosecution over white, female jurors made sense. Mr. Weinstein's accusers are white women "and of some social status," she said. "One might think that women similar to them would be sympathetic to the complainants."
On Friday, one of Mr. Weinstein's lawyers, Arthur Aidala, argued that one young white woman should not be selected because "she doesn't have the life skills and wasn't even alive when these events took place."
"People dated differently and the rules of dating were different," he said. "She'd have to read the history books to know what took place."
The questioning of the panelists hinted at the issues the jurors will wrestle with. Defense lawyers, for instance, asked potential jurors if they believed a person could have consensual sex with someone to get ahead in their career. They also asked people if they could tune out the avalanche of news coverage on the producer and focus only on evidence in the courtroom.
Prosecutors asked whether jurors could accept that someone might not immediately report a rape or cut off all ties with her attacker. "Does everyone appreciate that someone can be suffering in their personal life and put on a brave face and be happy in their public life?" Ms. Illuzzi asked.
Prosecutors also asked whether potential jurors could look past Mr. Weinstein's current physical appearance. Mr. Weinstein, who had back surgery recently, has shuffled into court slightly hunched with the help of a walker and often looks frail.
"Is there anything about Harvey Weinstein looking at him today that makes you feel that there's no way that man's a rapist?" one of the prosecutors, Meghan Hast, asked the potential jurors. "Anybody feel that?"
No one responded.

Texto completo: Until Friday, few executives had complained in public about how Google, Apple, Amazon and Facebook hurt their businesses.
For all the criticisms directed at the largest tech companies in the last couple of years, few smaller rivals have been willing to speak up publicly.
That changed for a couple of hours on Friday, as executives at four businesses pleaded with federal lawmakers to rein in Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.
At a congressional hearing in Boulder, Colo., top executives of Sonos, PopSockets, Basecamp and Tile testified that the biggest technology companies hindered their businesses. Their stories varied, but they shared a theme: The tech giants have used their powerful positions in search, e-commerce, online ads and smartphones to squeeze out them and other rivals.
Tile, which makes small tracking devices, said Apple had put up hurdles for Tile's smartphone app that didn't apply to Apple's competing product. Sonos, the high-end audio company, said Google had copied its patented speaker technology and used its dominance in search to enter new markets. PopSockets, which makes smartphone grips, said Amazon "bullied" it into sales agreements and ignored complaints about counterfeits on the retail platform.
"It's like playing a soccer game," said Kirsten Daru, the vice president and general counsel of Tile. "You might be the best team in the league, but you're playing against a team that owns the field, the ball, the stadium and the entire league, and they can change the rules of the game in their own favor and anytime."
The executives' criticism provided lawmakers on the House antitrust subcommittee, which conducted the hearing, with personal stories about the power and influence of Silicon Valley's biggest companies. Last year, the House opened a broad investigation into whether those large companies violated antitrust laws. At the same time, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission opened separate competition investigations into Amazon, Facebook Apple and Google. In addition, nearly all 50 states are investigating whether Facebook and Google engage in anticompetitive practices.
Despite all of those investigations, few companies have come forward to complain in public. The House antitrust subcommittee has interviewed dozens of companies that accuse the big tech companies of unlawfully stifling competition. Most have insisted on confidentiality. This month, Sonos sued Google on allegations of antitrust violations and patent infringement, in its first pointed action against the company.
Lawmakers at Friday's hearing, which was held in Boulder in part to draw more national attention to the House investigation, noted how rarely start-ups spoke out about their complaints, and encouraged them to keep making their case.
"Thank you for your testimony, and quite frankly your courage to be here today," said Representative Ed Perlmutter, a Democrat from Colorado. "Because when you take on dominant players, whether it's Amazon, Google, Apple or Facebook, you've got to have a little trepidation."
Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the antitrust subcommittee, thanked the executives for "describing economic retaliation."
The tech companies vehemently deny that they illegally harm competition. Google, for instance, has disputed all the claims made by Sonos and said it would fight the lawsuit.
The hearing capped a difficult week for big tech, which was the target of fierce criticism by top politicians. Much of that anger was directed at Facebook, which has refused to police lies shared by politicians on its social network.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday that Facebook "just cares about money" and that the company intended "to be accomplices in misleading the American people." Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has been the focus of false ads by President Trump's re-election campaign, told the New York Times editorial board that Facebook and other internet companies that allow the spread of misinformation on their sites should lose a critical liability shield for internet platforms. He also personally criticized Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive.
"I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan," Mr. Biden said. "He knows better."
The hearing on Friday focused entirely on whether the big companies dominate markets. The executives, who argued at length that companies like Google and Amazon unfairly hurt their businesses, received little pushback from lawmakers.
David Barnett, the founder of PopSockets, said Amazon had pressured it to lower listing prices or else allow unauthorized resellers to sell the product. He also alleged that Amazon allowed a flood of counterfeits to compete with PopSockets on the site to pressure the company into spending more on marketing.
It is "bullying with a smile," Mr. Barnett said.
David Heinemeier Hansson, the chief technology officer and a co-founder of Basecamp, a provider of online productivity tools, said Google's domination of the search industry forced his company to go online with the advertising titan's demands and decisions.
"The internet has been colonized by a handful of big tech companies that wield their monopoly powers without restraint," Mr. Hansson said.
Both Republicans and Democrats appeared to sympathize with him and the other executives.
"I think it's clear there's abuse in the marketplace and a need for action," said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado.
Mr. Cicilline said he didn't expect the executives or their companies to suffer any economic retaliation from the giants for testifying. "But if you do in any way, it would be of tremendous interest to this committee," he said.

Texto completo: After years of increases, auto insurance has become a budget pain point for many. But experts say there are ways to keep your rates down.
It's getting more expensive to insure your car, but there are some steps you can take to keep premiums affordable.
Average annual automobile insurance rates in the United States rose to $ 1,548 in 2019, according to an analysis by The Zebra, an insurance comparison website. While that was just a 2 percent increase from 2018 -- roughly on a par with the annual inflation rate -- it followed several years of larger increases, the report said.
Advanced technology is partly to blame for the higher costs, The Zebra said. Automakers are incorporating more anti-theft and safety features into their vehicles, like collision warning systems and blind-spot monitors, which make them safer to drive but more expensive to repair after an accident.
Even a minor fender bender can prove costly to fix, said Robert C. Passmore, assistant vice president of the American Property Casualty Insurance Association. Modern bumpers may house advanced sensors that must be replaced or recalibrated after an accident. Repairs no longer involve just "banging it out with a hammer," he said.
"They save lives and reduce the number of accidents," Mr. Passmore said of the new safety systems. "But there's some costs that come with it."
Insurers are also imposing stiffer penalties, or surcharges, for drivers ticketed for distracted driving. The average surcharge for texting while driving, for instance, is 23 percent of the premium, or more than $ 350 a year, the report found. These fees typically last for several years.
While insurance rates vary significantly by location because of differences in traffic congestion, crime, weather and state regulations, about two-thirds of American drivers saw their premiums increase last year, The Zebra's report found. (It analyzed 73 million auto rate quotes from 418 insurers using a driver profile based on a 30-year-old single man with a good driving record and a 2015 Honda Accord EX.)
In some cities and states, the annual cost is much higher than the national average. Michigan had the highest average rate at more than $ 3,000, followed by Louisiana and Florida, each topping $ 2,000. Maine and North Carolina have the lowest rates, at just under $ 1,000 a year. While average rates increased in most states, they fell in 17 states and the District of Columbia.
Exactly where you live, down to a few yards, can have a big impact. People living in lower-income ZIP codes were quoted more expensive premiums than those in neighboring communities, a 2018 Consumer Federation of America report found.
Insurers use multiple criteria to set auto rates, including a driver's age, driving record and typical annual mileage. Criteria vary, since state governments set insurance rules. Some states allow consideration of a person's credit history -- the better your credit score, the more you save -- so it helps if you pay your bills on time. Some let insurers consider a customer's marital status and occupation. At least a half-dozen states, including California, have banned the use of a driver's sex in setting insurance rates. (Nationally, women pay rates that are about 1 percent higher, The Zebra found, but the disparity is greater in some states.)
Other criteria are based on the vehicle, such as the model year and whether it's a sedan or a truck.
One way to keep premiums down, say industry experts and consumer advocacy groups, is to compare quotes from different insurers, ideally every year or two.
"It's worth a little bit of effort," said J. Robert Hunter, an insurance expert with the Consumer Federation.
If you find a lower rate, state insurance department websites often offer information about consumer complaints, to help you evaluate a company's record of handling claims before you switch. You may want to go beyond the most visible brands: Consumer Reports recently included some lesser-known companies, like the Rhode Island-based Amica Mutual Insurance, among its highly rated insurers.
Another way to lower your premium is to increase your policy's deductible, the amount of money that you must pay before insurance coverage begins. (With a $ 500 deductible, you would pay $ 500 for a $ 1,000 claim.) Raising your deductible to $ 1,000 from $ 500 will save an average of 13 percent on your premium, The Zebra found. Just be sure to put money aside so you can afford to pay the deductible if you have a claim, said Jon Linkov, the deputy auto editor at Consumer Reports.
And be careful not to let your policy lapse, said Nicole Beck, a spokeswoman for The Zebra. Even a short gap, she said, could trigger a substantial increase when you buy a new policy.
People who drive infrequently may want to consider usage-based insurance, which uses technology to monitor driving and can save about 3 percent, the report found.
For help in understanding coverage, try an online guide from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
Here are some questions and answers about car insurance:
Are some cars more expensive to insure than others?
Yes. Older cars, for instance, are generally cheaper to insure than new cars. The driver of a three-year-old Honda Accord would save about 12 percent on premiums compared with the cost of insuring a new model, the report found.
If you are shopping for a car and want to keep insurance rates down, consider a gently used, late-model car, Mr. Linkov said.
Am I required to insure my car?
All states except New Hampshire require minimum levels of liability coverage, which pays for another person's property damage, medical care and other costs caused by you.
Other types of coverage are usually optional (although if you finance a car, your lender may require them). They include collision coverage, which pays for damage to your car if it hits another car or something else, like a tree or a wall; and comprehensive coverage, which covers damage to your car from most everything else, like fire, hail, flooding and theft.
If your car is aging and its value has declined substantially, you may want to consider dropping optional coverages, to lower your premium, said Mr. Hunter, the insurance expert.
Are driver discounts available?
In many states, yes, so ask your agent. Insurers may offer discounts for bundling auto coverage with other types of insurance, like homeowner or renter's policies. There may be other discounts for having your premium payment automatically deducted from your bank account, or paying the full premium upfront, The Zebra found. Younger drivers may receive credit for maintaining good grades or taking a driver's education course.

William Barr isn't a toady. That's the nature of his job. Josh Hammer

Texto completo: Many have been all too quick to make Attorney General William Barr out to be a reflexive toady for President Trump. Just last week, the New York City Bar Association took the extreme step of writing to congressional leaders to investigate Barr for political bias. And last month, he came under blistering criticism for defending the Trump campaign and characterizing the FBI's Russia investigation into the 2016 election as bogus.
Slate has accused Barr of using the Department of Justice as "a personal law firm for Trump." Vox has bewailed "the department's politicization under Barr." The Daily Beast has lamented how Barr has "become another of Donald Trump's personal lawyers." The New York Times has noted that the attorney general had "reprised his role as a vocal defender of President Trump."
Perhaps none of these media outlets recall the time when then-Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. famously described himself as President Obama's "wingman." Curiously, Holder actually took to the Washington Post to decry Barr's ostensible self-debasement as an unfortunate "instrument of politics."
Holder's hypocrisy aside, the new stance in favor of a strongly independent attorney general among liberals is misguided as a matter of constitutional interpretation and ahistorical as a matter of American custom.
Article II, Section 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution states that "(t)he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America." The power is vested not in numerous sources, but solely in the president. The president maintains plenary authority over the entirety of the executive branch.
The "unitary executive theory," which Democrats routinely excoriate, comes from the plain text of the Constitution. As Barr recently said during his remarks at the Federalist Society's 2019 National Lawyers Convention, the notion of the unitary executive "is not 'new,' and it is not a 'theory.' " On the contrary, he continued, "(i)t is a description of what the Framers unquestionably did in Article II of the Constitution."
Throughout American history, attorneys general have intuited and acted upon their nonindependent subordination to presidents of the United States. In "Conflicting Loyalties: Law and Politics in the Attorney General's Office, 1789-1990," the scholar Nancy V. Baker explored the historical nature of the attorney general's position. Baker devoted entire book sections to "The Attorney General as a Legal Advisor" and "The Attorney General as a Policy Advisor." She observed that "before he became an administrator" of a sprawling Department of Justice bureaucracy, "the attorney general assumed the role of the advisor to the president." What's more, the attorney general's "responsibility" to serve in such an advisory capacity "has antecedents in seventeenth-century England."
Indeed, the role of the attorney general as a top presidential adviser has been a recurring theme throughout American history. When President Lincoln's attorney general, Edward Bates, famously wrote to Congress in 1861 to defend Lincoln's unilateral suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, he did so not as a neutral arbiter of legal principle, but as Lincoln's top legal adviser who shared his superior's ultimate policy aim of a Union victory in the Civil War.
Similarly, President Franklin Roosevelt's wartime attorney general, Francis Biddle, ceased his vocal opposition to Japanese American internment after it became obvious that Roosevelt planned to sign the fateful Executive Order 9066. Biddle understood that he was not in any way independent of the president, but that he was a political appointee who had to support the president in order to keep his job.
In modern times, the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which was created by Congress during the New Deal, provides "legal advice to the president and all executive branch agencies" and reviews "all executive orders and substantive proclamations proposed to be issued by the president." The president also has at his disposal the White House counsel's office, but that office tends to focus on legal issues arising from legislation, executive and judicial branch nominations and ethics questions.
Though the Office of Legal Counsel does sometimes reach legal conclusions at loggerheads with the White House, it is hardly independent in any meaningful way. Former Acting Assistant Attorney General David Barron, who led the OLC during the early years of the Obama administration, once stated that the office's legal analyses "may appropriately reflect the fact that its responsibilities also include facilitating the work of the Executive Branch and the objectives of the President, consistent with the law." And legal scholarship has observed the "systematic deference" that the Office of Legal Counsel generally shows toward the president's prerogatives.
Eric Holder was correct the first time. The attorney general, in large part, actually is the president's "wingman."

Texto completo: Past clients have included Claus von Bülow, O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson and Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier who was accused of sex trafficking and killed himself last year in a Manhattan jail.
WASHINGTON -- When Alan M. Dershowitz told President Trump this week that he would join the legal team for his impeachment trial in the Senate, his transformation from a onetime liberal standard-bearer into a conservative provocateur appeared to be complete.
Mr. Dershowitz, 81, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, prides himself on being a civil libertarian and a contrarian who isn't afraid to defend the seemingly indefensible, especially if that person has a high-profile, tabloid-friendly name. His past clients include Claus von Bülow, O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson and Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier who was accused of sex trafficking and killed himself last year in a Manhattan jail.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Dershowitz was also known as an advocate for the First Amendment who defended neo-Nazi speech and pornography and served on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union. Back then, according to The New Yorker, he also worked pro bono to represent clients involved in challenges to censorship and the death penalty.
Mr. Dershowitz's connections to Mr. Epstein, however, have proved the most complicating in recent years. In 2014, one of Mr. Epstein's victims, Virginia Giuffre, said in a court filing that Mr. Dershowitz was one of the Epstein friends to whom she was offered for sex.
Mr. Dershowitz has vociferously denied the allegations. On Fox News, he noted that he had a "perfect, perfect sex life during the relevant period of time." The accusations even inspired him to write a book, "Guilt by Accusation: The Challenge of Proving Innocence in the Age of #MeToo."
Since Mr. Trump took office, Mr. Dershowitz has frequently visited the West Wing, consulting with the president and his top aides on various issues, including the Middle East and the Mueller inquiry.
Mr. Dershowitz, who lives in New York, summers on Martha's Vineyard, and says his family of Democrats is deeply disturbed by his association with Mr. Trump, has known the president as a casual acquaintance since the 1990s.
But Mr. Trump took a greater interest in him after his regular Fox News appearances, during which Mr. Dershowitz often attacked the legal grounds for the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and defended the president's right to fire James B. Comey as the F.BI. director.
Despite Mr. Trump's frequent tweets praising him, Mr. Dershowitz has always maintained to reporters that he had no interest in formally joining Mr. Trump's legal team. In a brief interview on Friday, Mr. Dershowitz said that had not changed and tried to play down his role.
"I'm presenting an independent argument as an independent academic against impeachment, which is a view I've held for a long time," he said.
Mr. Dershowitz is expected to present oral arguments in the Senate trial next week and he insisted that those arguments would be the extent of his involvement in the trial.
"I felt it was important for the Constitution and for precedent and the future of the impeachment," he said.
His final conversation about joining the team took place on Wednesday night with Mr. Trump himself. "We discussed it and I agreed," Mr. Dershowitz said.

Old church becomes the ideal escape A 'sort of perfect' building - except for the outhouse

Texto completo: The first time Matthew Bremer saw the listing for the church he would eventually buy in Phillipsport, New York, it arrived like so many unwanted emails, as inbox-clogging spam. But rather than immediately hitting delete he scrolled down the email while eating lunch and was intrigued by what he saw: a simple white clapboard church dating to 1823 that was so untouched by time its only bathroom was an outhouse.
"It was this sort of perfect, almost child's drawing of the idea of a church," said Bremer, 51, the founder of Architecture in Formation, a Manhattan-based firm. "The white Colonial box."
Fantasizing about converting it into a private country escape, he and a friend took the two-hour drive north from New York City for a look.
"It was in this bucolic setting," he said, and had impressive architectural bones, as well as 14-foot-tall, triple-hung, divided-light windows that gave it a magical sense of light.
The following weekend, he returned with his partner, Shaun Skura.
"I was like, 'You're crazy,' " said Skura, 40, a relationship manager at LinkedIn. "However, I also saw instant potential, and I knew he would do something extraordinary with it."
The reality at the outset, Skura added, was clear: "We knew it was going to take a lot of blood, sweat and tears."
Before committing to buying it, Bremer wanted to be sure that the church could legally be converted to a private residence and that a septic system could be added so they could have indoor bathrooms.
After studying the half-acre property, he came to the conclusion that there was nowhere he could reasonably add a septic system. But he noticed an awkward vacant lot across the street with only a billboard for Shadowland Stages, a theater in nearby Ellenville.
"I reached out and said, 'Hey, is there any way that we could share this property,' " Bremer said. Eventually he struck a deal with the theater that allowed him to buy the property to use for his septic field for next to nothing, with the promise that the billboard would remain.
Then he spent the better part of the following year working on getting his unconventional plans approved by local authorities.
"It took a somewhat masochistic architect to go through and get four very specific variances to legalize the disused church to a residence," Bremer said.
Two years after he first visited the 2,200-square-foot church - a United Methodist Church that had been vacant for several years - Bremer finally felt confident that a conversion was possible and bought it for $100,000, in the spring of 2017.
He and Skura had contractors largely dismantle it down to the enormous structural timbers, in order to add the insulation, HVAC, plumbing and electrical systems it needed.
"It was ostensibly an old pole barn, uninsulated," said Bremer, who sought to keep the basic character of the building intact while "channeling Donald Judd, Gordon Matta-Clark and a little bit of John Waters."
In addition to adding the basic systems the building needed, they cut a hole in the floor for a staircase leading to the basement, which previously had only an outside entrance. On the lower level, they carved out three bedrooms and a bathroom with a subterranean shower illuminated by a ground-level skylight.
Upstairs, they designated the altar as the dining area and cut a large opening in the wall, to create an enormous picture window that also reveals some of the building's original framing. They tucked a stainless-steel kitchen under the loft, which they converted to an office and media lounge with a retractable projection screen. And they built a second bathroom behind the kitchen with a one-way mirror that allows occupants to look out over spice jars to see activity in the main living space.
Because there was no fireplace, they suspended a shapely steel Fireorb - a product more commonly associated with modernist glass boxes than old clapboard churches.
"I'm interested in how we, as a culture, have sort of moved beyond binaries of sacred and profane, and public and private," Bremer said. "Of course, when converting a church, all of that comes to the fore."
To furnish the place, Bremer and Skura repurposed many of the pews as headboards and footboards for beds. They scoured vintage stores and flea markets to find pieces like a large Harvey Probber sectional sofa and a walnut-and-galvanized-tin bathtub, which they installed in the open living space. To finish it off, they collected smaller, whimsical curiosities, including an old elevator sign from Macy's and a black-velvet Jesus painting.
After about a year and a half of construction, during which they spent more than $500,000, the couple moved in just before Christmas in 2018, and invited about a dozen friends to celebrate.
"We had nothing set up, and the table wasn't there, but we had a giant Christmas dinner with a lot of friends," Bremer said. "It was sort of the christening."
Still, the project, he conceded, isn't completely finished. After rebuilding the exterior entrance to the basement as a black box holding a neon sign that reads "House of Dog" - Bremer's employees gave him the sign as a 50th birthday gift, in tribute to the couple's Italian greyhound, Geoffrey - he is considering building a few more black boxes in the landscape.
"One is a swimming pool, one is a raised planter bed and one is an outdoor shower," he said.
"We will be working on it forever," he added. "It's the perfectly unfinished, forever project."

Texto completo: She installed an illegal gas line that led to the blast, which killed two men and leveled two apartment buildings.
To keep tens of thousands of dollars in monthly rent money rolling in, Maria Hrynenko, a landlord in the East Village, rolled the dice and decided to cut corners at her tenants' expense, installing a jury-rigged gas system. That gamble was illegal, perilous and, ultimately, deadly.
On Friday morning, Ms. Hrynenko learned that, as a result, she would spend between four and 12 years in prison.
Ms. Hrynenko was sentenced in State Supreme Court in Manhattan for allowing an illegal gas line on her property that caused a fatal 2015 explosion. The blast killed two men, obliterated two Manhattan buildings and injured more than a dozen people.
"The defendants did, in a matter of speaking, roll the dice on the lives of these people," Justice Michael J. Obus said in handing down Ms. Hrynenko's sentence.
A jury found Ms. Hrynenko and two other defendants -- a general contractor and an unlicensed plumber -- guilty of manslaughter and related offenses in November.
The contractor, Dilber Kukic, 44, and the plumber, Athanasios Ioannidis, 59, were also sentenced on Friday to between four and 12 years in prison. For all three defendants, the amount of time will be determined by their behavior in prison.
Ms. Hrynenko's son, Michael, 31, was also charged for his role in the scheme, but died in 2017 while awaiting trial. A fifth person, Andrew Trombettas, a licensed plumber who sold the use of his credentials to Mr. Ioannidis, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in March and was placed on probation.
The sentencing is the culmination of a narrative that began nearly five years ago after the blast leveled half of an East Village block and left New Yorkers worried about vulnerabilities in the city's infrastructure. The explosion happened just over a year after a 2014 gas blast leveled two buildings on Park Avenue in East Harlem, killing eight people.
The proceedings closed a painful chapter for the families of the two men killed in the blast: Nicholas Figueroa, 23, and Moises Ismael Locón Yac, 27, both immigrants in New York City.
"Part of the reason people come here is because of the system of justice that we have," Justice Obus said.
In court statements, relatives of both victims had asked for the maximum sentence of five to 15 years for all three defendants.
"For me and my family, life will never be the same," said Mr. Figueroa's mother, Ana Lanza. "I did not just lose my son that day. I lost my voice, my will to continue on, my will to live."
David Locón Yac, the brother of Moises Ismael Locón Yac, tearfully recalled the morning of the blast and the hug he gave his sibling just before he got on the subway, heading to work.
"The hardest part was telling my mother that my brother had died," he said.
Throughout the sentencing, Ms. Hrynenko sat quietly, occasionally dropping her head to wipe her eyes.
During the trial last year, prosecutors painted Ms. Hrynenko as a money-hungry landlord, eager to capitalize on New York's real estate boom, to catastrophic consequence.
"What was it that made these three defendants circumvent all the rules they were aware of?" the lead prosecutor, Rachana Pathak, said in her closing remarks in November. "Money, money, money."
At Friday's sentencing, Ms. Hrynenko's lawyer countered that characterization. He described his client as a survivor of domestic abuse who was a loving woman.
"She cares about others," the lawyer, Michael K. Burke, said. "She cares about people."
Mr. Kukic's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said his client, a refugee who had fled war-torn Montenegro decades ago, was a dedicated worker striving to help bring his family members to the United States.
Mr. Kukic told the court that he would trade his life for those of the victims "in a second."
From the start, prosecutors have described the case as a death-dealing plot of deceit, chicanery and subterfuge.
After the death of her husband in 2004, Ms. Hrynenko assumed control of his housing stock. She hired Mr. Kukic to renovate apartments at 121 Second Avenue in 2013.
The work was completed the next year, but the utility company Consolidated Edison did not approve gas lines for the apartments. Still, Ms. Hrynenko immediately began shuffling tenants into the building, subletting apartments at an average price of $ 6,000 each per month.
Hyeonil Kim, the owner of Sushi Park, a popular Japanese restaurant on the building's ground level, said he had wondered how the apartments got hot water and cooking gas since the only gas line into the building was dedicated to his restaurant.
In August 2014, Con Edison, responding to calls from people smelling gas, discovered that the utility line intended only for Sushi Park had been tapped with flexible plastic pipes to provide gas to the apartments. The company turned off gas at the building for nine days, until the plastic pipes were removed.
But Ms. Hrynenko, facing mounting complaints from tenants, devised a new plan. She would tap gas from a meter at her neighboring building at 119 Second Avenue and siphon it to her needy tenants, evidence at the trial showed.
The illegal system of pipes was constructed by Mr. Ioannidis and set up in a locked room in the basement at 121 Second Avenue, hidden from Con Ed inspectors, tenants and other workers, prosecutors said.
In 2015, on the day of the explosion, workers for the utility had returned to the building for a final inspection.
They found a faulty meter but no signs of leaking gas. Unknown to them, Mr. Kukic and Mr. Ioannidis had shut off the illegal gas line before the inspection, according to testimony at trial. Mr. Kukic even warned a tenant to say, if asked, "you don't have gas."
The explosion erupted when the two men turned the gas back on just minutes after Con Edison inspectors left the building.
As gas filled the basement, surveillance footage showed Mr. Kukic and Mr. Ioannidis running out of the building without warning any of the residents, Sushi Park patrons or calling 911, Mr. Vance said.
About one minute later, the gas-filled building exploded, sending flames as high as 40 feet into the air, a mushroom of billowing smoke over Lower Manhattan and the neighborhood into chaos.
Shards of shattered glass speckled the streets in front of the building, and onlookers described streets stained with blood as residents, patrons and workers, shellshocked by the explosion, bleeding and covered in dust and ash stumbled away from the fire.
The seven-alarm fire was so intense, the 250 firefighters called to the scene were forced at one point to withdraw from the building and attempt to quell the flames from a defensive position outside the building. "It was pretty crazy, pretty fast," one onlooker said in an interview.
"You rarely see a scene of such devastation in the middle of a city like this," Mayor Bill de Blasio told The New York Times as he surveyed the wreckage.
The bodies of Mr. Figueroa, who had been on a date at the sushi restaurant, and Mr. Yac, a busboy, were not recovered until three days after the blast.

Texto completo: One reader is cynical about G.O.P. senators' promise of impartiality. Another points out that the president got Ukrainian investigations, just not the ones he wanted.
To the Editor:
Re "Trump's Trial Opens as New Evidence Emerges" (front page, Jan. 17):
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts opened the impeachment trial of President Trump by swearing the Senate to "impartial justice." Why bother? By their own admission, the Republicans will not keep their oath. From the start, the trial is a sham.
If the current age has taught us anything, it is that personal interest, naked political ambition or tribal affiliation trumps everything else. Since the Republicans have committed to executing "partial justice," we have little choice but to teach our children to mistrust our highest elected officials. Perhaps mutual respect and community connection can exist on more local levels where we have to look one another in the eye. But not at the federal level. That connection has been broken.

To the Editor:
Re "Ukraine Reviews Claim That Allies of President Were Spying on Envoy" (news article, Jan. 17):
At long last, President Trump has gotten what he has been wishing for. The Ukrainian government is investigating corruption just as Mr. Trump requested. Not only are the Ukrainians investigating allies of Mr. Trump for spying on an American ambassador, but they are also asking the F.B.I. to help them investigate possible Russian attacks against the computer systems of Burisma, the Ukrainian company whose board Hunter Biden served on.
Congratulations, Mr. Trump, you have finally succeeded in getting the Ukrainian government to fight corruption. Perhaps now you can grant President Volodymyr Zelensky the White House visit he has longed for.

Texto completo: Successful in raising small contributions online and six-figure ones from wealthy donors, the campaign now wants to tap into supporters who can "bundle" contributions from friends and business associates.
President Trump's re-election campaign plans to step up its efforts to capitalize on so-called bundlers, supporters who can raise money from friends and business associates in increments up to $ 2,800, the legal limit for a level of giving that has lagged in the campaign despite a far more sophisticated fund-raising operation than existed in 2016.
The campaign has excelled at small-dollar fund-raising online and at raising six-figure donations from wealthy individuals and corporations for a joint-effort fund-raising arrangement between the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee.
But there has been little effort to cultivate bundlers who can gather donations from a network of friends and associates that can go directly to a candidate's campaign.
Mitt Romney and George W. Bush, who ran for president before legal changes allowed joint committees to accept six-figure checks, were prodigious fund-raisers who tended to their bundling networks, ranking them based on the amount they had raised and rewarding the bundlers with names like "Pioneers" and "Ramblers" and giving them special access at retreats and other events.
"In this environment, you should have a program for every segment of the giving community," said Scott Reed, the campaign manager for Senator Bob Dole's presidential race in 1996.
Mr. Trump has never appreciated the need for that kind of fund-raising, in part because of his disdain for the type of attention that donors expect in return, advisers have said.
The president's fund-raising has also benefited from the legal changes in 2014 that allow his political operation to collect six-figure checks by joint committees with the Republican Party -- options not available to Republican candidates before Mr. Trump.
But the move to focus more on bundlers comes as Mr. Trump has been increasingly concerned by how much his potential Democratic opponents are spending, particularly Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who estimates he has spent several hundred million dollars so far on his campaign and is prepared to spend as much as a billion dollars in all.
Mr. Trump's team has named Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News personality and girlfriend of the president's oldest son who has also become a top campaign surrogate, as the national chairwoman for the Trump Victory Finance Committee.
Among her roles will be overseeing the bundler program, which started in May and is set to get more structure, as the campaign heads toward the general election in the fall.
Ms. Guilfoyle said in an interview that there were already new donors who have approached her at events she has done around the country for Mr. Trump who were looking for a point of contact for their giving.
"I want to give them the confidence that their money is going to be put to excellent use," she said, noting that for many people, "this is the first time that they've written a check to a politician."
Ms. Guilfoyle, the former wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, has an extensive Rolodex in that state and in New York, where donors to previous Republican candidates have been generally cool to Mr. Trump, particularly donors who supported Mr. Romney, the party's presidential nominee in 2012.
But she said she was also looking to develop new bundlers who could keep building on the campaign's network.
"Kimberly uniquely unites all elements of the Trump coalition, and it is a reflection of the importance the Trump family places on the fund-raising program," said Jack Oliver, a bundler for Mr. Bush.
For the past year, the question of how much the president might need such "hard dollar" checks has been a source of debate and, at times, contention among his aides. But there has been little effort to cultivate people who can gather checks in increments of $ 2,800 at a rapid clip, according to multiple campaign advisers.
Last spring, allies of the president urged Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser who is directing Mr. Trump's campaign from the White House, to do more to cultivate bundlers.
But it became an issue in the rivalry between Mr. Kushner and Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.
More recently, the two have reached a détente, according to people close to the campaign. Still, the fund-raising concerns remain, and Mr. Kushner has said he wished some of the top fund-raisers who were rewarded by the president with ambassadorships were still able to raise money, according to two people familiar with his statements.
Mr. Trump's campaign has repeatedly highlighted its fund-raising numbers, referring to them as "staggering" in a recent news release. The president began the year with close to $ 200 million in cash on hand between his campaign, the Republican National Committee and other affiliated entities. The groups raised just over a collective $ 460 million in 2019.
This past week, thanks to joint fund-raising agreements between the campaign, the national committee and 22 state parties, the Trump political operation increased the maximum contribution it could accept to $ 580,600 per person, giving wealthy donors the ability to park more of their money with the Trump re-election effort.
But some of the money that goes to the committee is restricted to specific uses, while the hard-dollar money can be used for broader purposes, like staff, advertising and field operations.

Texto completo: The white living room in Olusanya Ojikutu's home, with its soaring cathedral ceiling, is a temple to his traditional and contemporary African art. Sculptures bookend the sofa, paintings and prints decorate the walls, and the overall atmosphere is one of beauty, historic grandeur and repose.
Most of Ojikutu's sculptures are at least a century old, created for performances or rituals. "They served as intermediaries between the local people and their ancestors' spirits to make their lives better and protect them from evil forces in this world and beyond," he said.
Among the dozens of sculptures are a metal Kota reliquary guardian figure from Gabon, a wood Bamana Chi Wara headdress from Mali and a wood-fiber Bwa plank mask from Burkina Faso.
"African art has long been seen as a monolith, but it really has many different origins," said Ojikutu, who is also an artist. "It should be recognized as more nuanced and coming from the many countries on the continent. I try to show that expanse of art forms and visual cultures in my collection."
Ojikutu, 50, of Nigeria, immigrated to the United States in the mid-1990s. He and his wife, Yinka, both work in technology and live with their two teenage sons in a Washington suburb.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Q: Why is it important to have connections to the art you collect?
The connection I feel toward any piece I buy, own or display is almost always love at first sight. Typically it's a numinous experience; the work speaks to me. I feel this instant visual attraction followed by an unconscious burst of inspiration.
Ile-Ife (Nigeria), where I went to university, is considered the ancestral home of the Yoruba and the legendary birthplace of the gods and humankind, so I have a natural connection to Yoruba history, art and culture because it's my personal history.
I also feel a connection when I buy artists I know. Like Victor Ehikhamenor, who happens to be my friend. I bought "No Man Is an Island" (2018). If you look closely, you see small black figures and faces embedded in the large silhouette. The paradigm he presents viewers is, "There are people within you and behind you and in front of you." It's all about connections.

Q: The timespan between early African art and contemporary art is wide. Do artists today appreciate traditional African art?
Certainly I believe a handful do care about, study and are somewhat influenced by African art, particularly masks. And I feel I'm following in the footsteps of artists like Gauguin, Picasso, Modigliani, Klee, Matisse and, more recently, Bacon and Basquiat, who were emotionally connected to and influenced by traditional African art.

Q: Was there a trigger moment to your collecting?
I think there were two.
A long time ago, an artist friend, Dapo Ojoade, wanted me to look at a colorfully painted flat wood sculpture he made. So I went to his house and said, "I love it. I want it." That was the first catalyst.
Then in 2016, I attended the auction of the art estate of Merton D. Simpson. He was the most prominent African American dealer of African art and he was a painter himself. I thought, "I want to do what he has done."

This yellow painting is redolent of El Anatsui.
It is by El Anatsui, painted in the 1980s. The adinkra motifs are considered a precursor to his majestic tapestries.

The crown on this caryatid resembles the African American museum on the National Mall.
The crown's shape was the inspiration for David Adjaye's design of the museum.
I have a profound connection to the museum because I participated in the Middle Passage exhibit. The exhibitors wanted a mix of authentic voices to reenact the anguish and suffering of slaves crossing the Atlantic. I contributed the Yoruba voice.

Q: How do you share your collection?
Yinka and I organize a yearly salon in a Gertrude Stein kind of way in the lower level of our house. That's where our photo collection is - pictures by Andrew Dosunmu, Zak Ové, George Osodi, Barthélémy Toguo, J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere - many of my paintings and Nok terra cotta, a fragile fired-clay sculpture from sometime between 500 B.C. to 200 A.D.
We invite people over to talk about art. We make sure you feel comfortable and that when you leave you see African art as beautiful and as conversation pieces that inspire thoughtful concentration to be fully appreciated.

'Shock wave' over Oprah move; Co-directors of a Russell Simmons doc are blindsided when Winfrey pulls support.

Texto completo: Twenty minutes. That's how long Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering had to digest the news that Oprah Winfrey was pulling her support of their documentary before she released the announcement to the press.
The email from Winfrey, sent at 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 10, had come as a shock. In her message, the filmmakers said, the Harpo Productions head said she would no longer be serving as the executive producer of their documentary, "On the Record," about the survivors of Russell Simmons' alleged sexual abuse. Subsequently, the movie -- set to premiere at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival -- was dropped from a planned release on Apple TV+ through Winfrey's deal with the streaming platform.
"In my opinion, there is more work to be done on the film to illuminate the full scope of what the victims endured and it has become clear that the filmmakers and I are not aligned in that creative vision," Winfrey said in her 3:30 p.m. statement, in which she also made it clear she "unequivocally" believes and supports the film's subjects. "Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering are talented filmmakers. I have great respect for their mission but given the filmmakers' desire to premiere the film at the Sundance Film Festival before I believe it is complete, I feel it's best to step aside."

Dick and Ziering, who have collaborated on six nonfiction films together, had never been under the impression that Winfrey had serious concerns about the documentary. On the contrary: Ever since they first met with her in New York in January 2019, they said, she had been effusive in her praise of the project.
"She loved, loved, loved what we did," recalled Ziering, sitting in her Brentwood home alongside Dick, her filmmaking partner, earlier this week. "And then she saw it numerous times throughout the editing process. We had a very close working relationship and very, very positive -- enthusiastically positive. There weren't any issues."
Winfrey announced a collaboration with Dick and Ziering -- then called "Toxic Labor" -- at Apple TV's first media presentation in Cupertino, Calif., on March 25. Apple, which also did not respond to The Times' inquiries, subsequently wrote the application submitting the movie to Sundance in October, the filmmakers said. It was accepted to the festival, and in November, Ziering and Dick locked picture. On Dec. 3 -- a day before the Sundance lineup was released -- Harpo and Apple put out their own announcement touting the collaboration.
"Apple was busy booking us rooms and flights," Ziering said. "There was no intonation of any problems whatsoever."
Online, however, backlash was brewing. On Dec. 12, rapper 50 Cent posted a picture of a smiling Winfrey and Simmons together on his Instagram account, accompanied by a caption questioning "why Oprah is going after black men" instead of Harvey Weinstein or Jeffrey Epstein. He alluded to the fact that Winfrey had also supported two alleged survivors of Michael Jackson's sexual abuse who appeared in the HBO documentary "Leaving Neverland." After that film aired in March 2019, Winfrey sat down with the subjects, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, for an interview special. She has since said that never before in her career had one of her interviews sparked such "hateration."
Simmons, meanwhile, voiced his own disappointment with Winfrey on Dec. 13. In a letter addressed to her, the disgraced former R&B mogul said he found it "troubling" that she had chosen him to "single out" in the project. The filmmakers were not concerned by the post: "That's accused predator playbook 2.0," Ziering said.
Winfrey did not respond to The Times' request for comment for this story, but subsequently told the New York Times that Simmons repeatedly appealed to her to distance herself from the project. She contends, however, that she left the project over creative concerns including how the film presents and contextualizes the accusations against Simmons.
A few days after Simmons' letter went public, the directors received a new round of notes from Harpo, and Winfrey suggested the film might not be ready for Sundance. The suggestions they'd received from the production company up to this point, they said, had been "wonderful" and "acute" -- mostly small things such as "We don't like the way this scene transitions" or "Can we build out this scene because we want more of this character," Dick explained.
--
'Moving forward'
Receiving the notes after picture lock was startling to the filmmakers, but they were not alarmed. "We felt like we could address them," Dick said. "We didn't really feel like the film needed them, because the film was already good, but as good partners, we wanted to honor the relationship and just keep moving forward. So what we had to do was cancel a lot of holiday plans, but we have a great staff and we pushed forward and we got it out."
The directors urged Harpo to move ahead with the Sundance release, arguing that it could be traumatizing for the alleged survivors featured in the documentary to change the distribution path once it had already been announced. And more changes could be made to the film post-Sundance -- a common scenario for movies that debut at the annual January festival.
"Much as we wanted [Winfrey] to be happy and keep up the amazing relationship we had -- and as much as we really do totally respect her vision -- we felt and argued that we couldn't blink," Ziering recalled. "People would say that there's a problem. If she didn't want to go to Sundance or there was a change of heart about the distribution plan, the time for that had passed."
When Winfrey's Jan. 10 statement went wide, the filmmakers immediately reached out to the women in the movie -- Simmons' accusers including Drew Dixon, Sil Lai Abrams, Sheri Hines and Alexia Norton Jones -- to check in. "I felt horrible that we didn't have more advance time to set them up and warn them," Ziering said, her eyes filling with tears. "That's a shock wave. It was horrible. It's been horrible." The Simmons documentary is the fourth that Ziering and Dick have tackled on the subject of sexual abuse. They have explored the issue in the church ("Twist of Faith"), on college campuses ("The Hunting Ground") and in the military ("The Invisible War," nominated for documentary feature at the 2013 Oscars). For years, they said, they had wanted to delve into sexual harassment in Hollywood and had spoken with Weinstein's alleged survivors prior to fall 2017, when claims of his predatory behavior first surfaced in the New York Times. (The Weinstein Co.'s RADiUS-TWC division released "The Hunting Ground.")
"We had gone to several distributors and did not get funding, not surprisingly," Dick said of the pair's pre-#MeToo efforts. But as soon as an avalanche of serious accusations involving powerful entertainment industry figures began to pour out in late 2017, Dick and Ziering were able to secure financing from Impact Partners, the company behind documentaries including Academy Award winners "The Cove" and "Icarus."
At first, Dick and Ziering cast a wide net -- reaching out to victims, executives and even this reporter about appearing in the film. Through a mutual filmmaker friend, they were connected with Drew Dixon, who told them that Simmons had raped her in his Manhattan apartment while she was working as a 24-year-old executive assistant at Def Jam Recordings in 1995. At the time, the Los Angeles Times had yet to publish the first public accusations against Simmons. That came on Nov. 19, 2017, when Keri Claussen Khalighi told the paper that in 1991, when she was a 17-year-old model, Simmons had forced her to perform oral sex on him and then penetrated her from behind while she was showering. Since then, an additional 19 women -- including Dixon, who spoke out in a Dec. 13, 2017, New York Times article -- have alleged that Simmons was sexually inappropriate with them. He has vehemently denied all the claims, describing himself as a reformed "womanizer" who has "never been violent or forced myself on anyone."
As Dixon was wrestling with whether to speak publicly, the filmmakers were trailing her with cameras.
"We told her: 'No one has ever seen the inside of what it is when someone grapples with that decision,' " said Ziering. " 'Do you mind if we follow your journey? And no harm, no foul. You can stop us anytime. You can tell us to go away. We're survivor-focused, survivor-first, so I don't want you to feel any emotional pressure, and if after six months you tell us you don't want us to use the footage, we're totally fine.' And I meant that. I always say that to anybody we talk to."
--
Focusing in
Ultimately, they decided to focus their first #MeToo project -- they have several more in the pipeline -- on Dixon and the plight of African American women who decide to speak out about sexual abuse.
"No one wants to compare the parade of horribles, but what we ... find revelatory is the unique bind that women of color find themselves in," Ziering said. "As Drew points out, sexual assault is sort of baked into the DNA of our country. Women of color came to our country as property and they could be assaulted and they had no recourse to any kind of system of justice. That's their legacy of their trauma. So a couple centuries later, here we are, and it hasn't shifted where they feel like the police necessarily take their claims with the same legitimacy [of] a person [that] society privileges.
"And you have the second hurdle of -- because of our culture's incredible history of racism and because the ground zero for many racist tropes is 'a black man is a predator or rapist or some kind of criminal' -- do they really want to come forward and pile onto the burden that all black men feel when they walk down the street in America? And then ... when they do come forward, the black community is very torn and divided, because you gotta circle the wagons." Dick and Ziering acknowledged that some of the film's subjects initially had an issue with the fact that two white directors wanted to tell their story.
"I owned it," Ziering said. "I said, 'Well, yeah. Let's talk about it.' "
Some of those conversations -- held on and off camera -- were included in earlier incarnations of the film but ultimately were excluded because the filmmakers did not want to draw focus to themselves.
"But it was a playing out of the very problem that the film was investigating," Ziering said. "Do you go out to the white community and share your burden, and do you trust the white community to take care of your burden with the care, sensitivity, intelligence and empathy and with the moral rectitude that it deserves?"
Through the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund, which is handling press for some of Simmons' alleged survivors, Dixon and the other women in the film declined to be interviewed for this story. But on her Twitter account, Dixon has insinuated that Winfrey's removal from the project left her feeling disappointed. In a since-deleted Jan. 10 tweet, she wrote to her followers: "Thank you for your support. With love from under the bus."
As for the filmmakers, they're still licking their wounds. But they're also looking forward to the Jan. 25 Sundance premiere, where they will be seeking a new distribution partner.
"We wish we were going with Apple and Ms. Winfrey. I mean, we do. But it's bigger than those two, really," Dick said. "We feel the film is completely solid, addresses everything very powerfully. We know that it does because the responses of hundreds of people from all walks of life have been so glowing and enthusiastic. We stand by the film, we stand by the survivors' stories completely, we know that the veracity is completely locked down. We think the film is strong and we are very hopeful that audiences at Sundance will feel the same."

Texto completo: COOINDA, Australia - At a time when vast tracts of Australia are burning, Violet Lawson is never far from a match.
In the woodlands surrounding her home in the far north of the country, she lights hundreds of small fires a year - literally fighting fire with fire. These traditional aboriginal practices, which reduce the undergrowth that can fuel bigger blazes, are attracting new attention as Australia endures disaster and confronts a fiery future.
Over the past decade, fire-prevention programs, mainly on aboriginal lands in northern Australia, have cut destructive wildfires in half. While the efforts draw on ancient ways, they also have a thoroughly modern benefit: Organizations that practice defensive burning have earned $80 million under the country's cap-and-trade system as they have reduced greenhouse-gas emissions from wildfires in the north by 40%.
These programs, which are generating important scientific data, are being held up as a model that could be adapted to save lives and homes in other regions of Australia, as well as fire-prone parts of the world as different as California and Botswana.
"Fire is our main tool," Lawson said as she inspected a freshly burned patch where grasses had become ash but the trees around them were undamaged. "It's part of protecting the land."
The fire-prevention programs, which were first given government licenses in 2013, now cover an area three times the size of Portugal. Even as towns in the south burned in recent months and smoke haze blanketed Sydney and Melbourne, wildfires in northern Australia were much less severe.
"The Australian government is now starting to see the benefits of having indigenous people look after their lands," said Joe Morrison, one of the pioneers of the project. "Aboriginal people who have been through very difficult times are seeing their language, customs and traditional knowledge being reinvigorated and celebrated using Western science."
In some ways, the aboriginal methods resemble Western ones practiced around the world: One of the main goals is to reduce underbrush and other fuel that accelerates hot, damaging fires.
But the ancient approach tends to be more comprehensive. Indigenous people, using precisely timed, low-intensity fires, burn their properties the way a suburban homeowner might use a lawn mower.
Aboriginal practices have been so successful in part because of a greater cultural tolerance of fire and the smoke it generates. The country's thinly populated north, where aboriginal influence and traditions are much stronger than in the south, is not as hamstrung by political debates and residents' concerns about the health effects of smoke.
The landscape and climate of northern Australia also make it more amenable to preventive burning. The wide open spaces and the distinctive seasons - a hot dry season is followed by monsoon rains - make burning more predictable.
Yet despite these regional differences, those who have studied the aboriginal techniques say they could be adapted in the more populated parts of the country.
"We most certainly should learn to burn aboriginal-style," said Bill Gammage, a professor at the Australian National University in Canberra. "Our firefighters have quite good skills in fighting fires. But for preventing them, they are well short of what aboriginal people could do."
Last week, Victor Cooper, a former forest ranger in northern Australia, lit a wad of shaggy bark to demonstrate the type of fire that burns at temperatures low enough to avoid damage to sensitive plants that are crucial food for animals.
The preventive fires, he said, should trickle, not rage. They must be timed according to air temperature, wind conditions and humidity, as well as the life cycles of plants. Northern aboriginal traditions revolve around the monsoon, with land burned patch by patch as the wet season gives way to the dry.
"We don't have a fear of fire," said Cooper, who burns regularly around his stilt house nestled in woodlands. "We know the earlier we burn, the more protection we have."
This year, he will become certified to join the carbon credits program. Money earned through that system has incentivized stewardship of the land and provided hundreds of jobs in aboriginal communities, where unemployment rates are high. The funds have also financed the building of schools in underserved areas.
NASA satellite data is used to quantify the reduction in carbon emissions and do computer modeling to track fires. Modern technology also supplements the defensive burning itself: Helicopters drop thousands of incendiary devices the size of pingpong balls over huge patches of territory at times of the year when the land is still damp and fires are unlikely to rage out of control.
Those taking part in the program say they are frustrated that other parts of the country have been reluctant to embrace the same types of preventive burning. The inaction is long-standing: A major federal inquiry after deadly fires more than a decade ago recommended wider adoption of aboriginal methods.
The pioneering defensive burning programs in northern Australia came together in the 1980s and '90s when aboriginal groups moved back onto their native lands after having lived in settlements under the encouragement, or in some cases the order, of the government.
Depopulated for decades, the land had suffered. Huge fires were decimating species and damaging rock paintings.
"The land was out of control," said Dean Yibarbuk, a park ranger whose indigenous elders encouraged him to seek solutions.
The aboriginal groups ultimately teamed up with scientists, the government of the Northern Territory and Houston-based oil company ConocoPhillips, which was building a natural gas facility and was required to find a project that would offset its carbon emissions.
According to calculations by Edwards, wildfires in northern Australia burned 57% fewer acres last year than they did on average in the years from 2000 to 2010, the decade before the program started.
Yibarbuk, who is now chairman of Warddeken Land Management, one of the largest of the participating organizations, employs 150 aboriginal rangers, part time and full time.
"We are very lucky in the north to be able to keep our traditional practices," Yibarbuk said. "There's a pride in going back to the country, managing it and making a difference."

Texto completo: With some selective spin, the mixed-martial arts promotion has been billing its biggest star as past most of his legal troubles since a loss in October 2018.
LAS VEGAS -- In the week leading into his first fight in more than a year, the U.F.C. star Conor McGregor has exuded a confidence familiar to anyone who has followed his transformation from Ultimate Fighting Championship contender to the fight promotion's biggest star.
His posture, perfect. His suits, tailored. His chin, held high.
But his trademark trash talk has been absent. Instead, McGregor saluted fans and shook hands at a midweek news conference with the rugged veteran Donald Cerrone, his opponent in the main event at U.F.C. 246 on Saturday night. Over the next half-hour he complimented Cerrone, who is nicknamed Cowboy, on everything from his fighting acumen to his reptile-skin blazer (made of python, Cerrone said).
The new sales pitch for McGregor and the U.F.C.: Conor the sportsman, not Conor the heel.
The version of McGregor on display ahead of his first bout since a loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018 is friendlier but more focused than before, and bent on redemption from high-profile losses and image-tarnishing arrests.
No matter which side he shows, McGregor is undoubtedly a critical part of the U.F.C.'s plans for 2020 as a star who has attracted fight fans and mainstream audiences. McGregor figures to boost the promotion's ticket and pay-per-view sales by simply entering the octagon to fight Cerrone, a fan favorite known for taking fights across divisions who is also coming off consecutive losses. An impressive win by McGregor, who already owns several U.F.C. sales records, would set him and the promotion up for still more paydays this year.
"Fully prepared, fully committed Conor McGregor -- there's no one that can touch me," the 31-year-old fighter said during Wednesday's news conference. "I made this game what it is. I'm going to go in there and remind everyone, and show the world Jan. 18."
But McGregor has spent the last 15 months estranged from the sport he claims he built, dealing with a string of legal issues. The brawl that erupted after the loss to Nurmagomedov earned McGregor a six-month suspension and a $ 50,000 fine from Nevada regulators. McGregor also pleaded guilty in two assault cases, one for smashing a tourist's phone in Miami, and another for slugging a 60-year-old bar patron in Ireland.
McGregor has avoided talking about two cases that are potentially more severe, separate police investigations in Ireland of sexual assault. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that he had not been charged, and the existence of the investigations does not imply that McGregor is guilty of any crime.
Through a publicist, McGregor has denied all accusations of sexual assault. The U.F.C. president, Dana White, said Wednesday that the investigations never jeopardized Saturday's showdown.
McGregor was silent when asked about the cases, though he told ESPN in an interview broadcast Monday that things just needed to play out. "Time will reveal all, time will tell all," he said. "And then that's it."
The fight card features no title bouts and depends mainly on McGregor to drive sales.
According to the Nevada Athletic Commission, McGregor's loss to Nurmagomedov drew 17,835 spectators and $ 17.2 million in ticket revenue. Both figures are records for M.M.A. events in the state. Of the top six grossing M.M.A. cards in Nevada, McGregor has headlined five. His August 2017 boxing match against Floyd Mayweather earned $ 55.4 million in ticket revenue, according to the commission. McGregor is the only fighter to appear on the top-10 gate revenue lists for both boxing and M.M.A. events.
McGregor's legal issues have not alienated his most dedicated fans. In fact, the U.F.C. incorporated several of McGregor's arrests into prefight promotional videos, casting them as consequences of immature acts that McGregor has outgrown.

White and McGregor said this week that they hoped the fighter could compete three times this year, a schedule that depends in part on McGregor's avoiding trouble. They teased a series of possibilities for the rest of 2020, including rematches with Mayweather or Nurmagomedov, a quick turnaround fight in March, or even a boxing match with Manny Pacquiao.
"Anything is possible," White said. "Let's see what happens on Saturday."
Oddsmakers foresee a McGregor win, with many sports books seeing him as a 3-to-1 favorite over Cerrone.
Without McGregor, it is not clear which fighters on U.F.C.'s roster are capable of generating mainstream appeal.
Ideally, multiple athletes would fill that role, the way elite quarterbacks like Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson all function as N.F.L. standard bearers. But while McGregor was inactive, the U.F.C. did not always have a single, standout, crossover star.
The former bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey played that role in the mid-2010s, but she has not fought since 2016, after back-to-back losses, and she has not publicly expressed interest in returning.
Her predecessor, the longtime welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre, took a four-year hiatus starting in 2013 and ending with a November 2017 win over Mike Bisping. Last year, St-Pierre, a Canadian, retired for good.
The light-heavyweight champion Jon Jones, who currently tops the U.F.C.'s pound-for-pound rankings, rode a string of spectacular wins to stardom in the early 2010s. But arrests and three failed tests for performance-enhancing drugs have sidelined him for long stretches, limiting his profile.
McGregor is unambiguously famous, however, and in a sport where pay is proportional to the size of the audience a fighter draws, a star at the top of the roster has other U.F.C. fighters envisioning their own paydays.
Jorge Masvidal, a welterweight contender who beat Nate Diaz in a November fight at Madison Square Garden that was attended by President Trump, is in line for a fight with the champion Kamaru Usman. But Masvidal told reporters on Thursday that he would rather fight McGregor, framing the choice as a business decision.
"If me and Conor go in the octagon, what happens? It's one of the biggest fights in history," Masvidal said. "Just by math, proven by what Conor's been doing, the last couple fights that I've had -- the engagement, the pay-per-views."
He added, "It's a formula for success."
The first windfall goes to Cerrone, a 36-year-old fighter from New Mexico, who was chosen as an opponent because his fighting style when matched up against McGregor's should produce a high-impact, high action bout.
At his best, McGregor dazzles opponents with speed, power and timing. In December 2015, he flattened the featherweight champ Jose Aldo with a single straight right hand, ending a heavily hyped title fight in just 13 seconds.
Cerrone, who has won 36 of 50 career bouts, is a versatile kickboxer who is willing to endure punishment before inflicting it. He has competed 33 times under the U.F.C. banner, which is tied for the record. But he has never headlined a pay-per-view event. Saturday represents a change to his career's trajectory.
"Here's the biggest one. Let's see," Cerrone said.
Where McGregor has fought just once since November 2016, Cerrone has competed 11 times over that span. It's not clear, though, whether staying that active gives him an advantage. Cerrone has five wins and six losses in those fights, and was knocked out in his last two bouts.
Still, he enters Saturday with a size advantage. Both fighters were expected to weigh in below the contracted 171-pound limit, but Cerrone stands at 6 feet tall to McGregor's 5-foot-9.
McGregor said he would neutralize Cerrone's size with speed and strategy.
"I like him a lot. He's a good guy," McGregor said. "But I can read Donald like a children's book."

Texto completo: Expert also directed arms control agency
Ralph Earle II, an arms control expert who served during the Carter administration as lead U.S. negotiator at the SALT II talks with the Soviet Union and as director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, died Jan.-13 at a hospital in Sarasota, Fla. He was 91.
The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his son Ralph Earle III said.
Mr. Earle's government service spanned three decades, beginning with his appointment in 1968 as a Pentagon aide for international security affairs. A decade later, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to succeed Paul C. Warnke as chief negotiator for the second round of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, known as SALT II. Mr. Earle, whose post accorded him ambassadorial rank, had previously acted as Warnke's deputy.
The SALT II agreement, which would have limited the number of nuclear warheads the two nations could maintain, ultimately broke down after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
Mr. Earle, whom the New York Times described as 'an able administrator who has managed to steer clear of controversies,' went on to lead the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1980 until Carter was succeeded by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
Having begun his career in legal practice, Mr. Earle worked with the Lawyers Alliance for Nuclear Arms Control, later the Lawyers Alliance for World Security, before returning to the arms control agency as deputy director in 1994. He retired in 1999.
Once asked whether he felt burdened by his work in arms control, or by the potential consequences if diplomacy gave way to war, he remarked that 'you think about it but can't dwell on it,' according to the Times.
Ralph Earle II was born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., on Sept. 26, 1928. His father, George H. Earle III, was a Democrat who served as Pennsylvania governor from 1935 to 1939.
Mr. Earle accompanied his father on diplomatic postings as U.S. minister to Austria in 1933 and 1934, during the run-up to World War II, and as U.S. minister to Bulgaria from 1940 until the country declared war on the United States in 1941.
Early that year, George Earle touched off what the Times described as a 'cafe skirmish' in the Bulgarian capital by requesting that a band play 'Tipperary,' a British marching song from World War I. An enraged German officer silenced the Bulgarian band, which shifted to a German waltz. Bottles began flying through the air, sending guests scurrying under tables, and making news across the Atlantic.
The younger Mr. Earle received a bachelor's degree in history in 1950 from Harvard University, then served in the Army before completing studies at Harvard Law School in 1955.
He practiced law in Philadelphia with the firm now known as Morgan Lewis before joining the Defense Department. His assignments included advising the U.S. mission to NATO.
Mr. Earle was a Washington resident before settling in Florida last year. He belonged to the Metropolitan Club in the District as well as several organizations of Sherlock Holmes enthusiasts.
His first marriage, to Eleanor Owens, ended in divorce. Survivors include his wife of 33 years, the former Julie von Sternberg of Manasota Key, Fla.; five children from his first marriage, Eleanor Earle Mascheroni of New York City, Ralph Earle III of Boston, Duncan Earle of Lusaka, Zambia, Amanda Earle Ciccarelli of Bloomington, Ind., and Caroline Earle Walsh of Barrington, R.I.; a half sister; and nine grandchildren.

Texto completo: NEW YORK " A defense lawyer for Harvey Weinstein asked potential jurors in his sexual assault case on Friday whether they believed a person would have sex with a boss for career-advancement purposes before the 12th and final juror selected and sworn in.
Asking for a 'show of hands,' attorney Arthur Aidala put that question to a panel of 20 people under consideration to weigh Weinstein's fate in connection to three alleged sexual assaults that could land him in prison for life.
'Who here thinks that someone would have consensual sexual relations with someone at work to get ahead at work?' Aidala posed to the group.
A number of hands went up " at least 10 " and Aidala's allotted time with the panel was over.
The jury " selected early Friday afternoon along with three alternates " is composed of seven men and five women. There are four black jurors and the rest are white.
Over strenuous objection from the defense, a woman who wrote a novel concerning predatory older men was selected as Juror No.11. The defense claimed that she lied about her experience with the subject and asked for a mistrial " which Justice James Burke brushed off and did not rule on.
In questioning, defense lawyer Damon Cheronis asked the author directly about the book, and she denied the subject matter that is clearly described on her own website. She said its female main characters have relationships with older men, but that 'it's not a predatory situation at all.'
Cheronis, outside the presence of the jurors, called her responses 'wishy-washy.' She's 'exactly the type of juror who should not sit on this jury.'

Weinstein, 67, is charged with rape, a criminal sex act and predatory sexual assault; he faces a minimum of 10 years behind bars on the top count. He was arrested in May 2018, months after he faced a swarm of sexual assault and harassment allegations that propelled the #MeToo movement.
The once-powerful film producer denies the charges, and his representatives have maintained that Weinstein never had nonconsensual sex with anyone.
Concentrated jury questioning by the attorneys, a process known as voir dire, began Thursday morning. The trial for the Hollywood figure began last week in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
On Jan. 6, the first day of his trial, Weinstein was hit with a new set of sexual assault charges relating to two incidents in Los Angeles, after a lengthy investigation. Weinstein's lawyers called the timing of that announcement a 'coordinated' publicity stunt.
Aidala used up the defense's 20th and last peremptory challenge by 11 a.m., meaning the team could no longer cut people without providing justification. The defense team probably would have excused the author, who Cheronis said 'was not forthcoming about the subject of the book.'
Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon has repeatedly accused the Weinstein team of eliminating women, especially white women, in a concerted effort. At one point, Cheronis accused Illuzzi-Orbon of 'systematically' eliminating men.
Aidala defended his elimination of a Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital employee and beauty pageant winner because she also made a go at acting and has experience as a model. She admitted in her questionnaire that in her late 20s she tried and failed to make it in that business.
'Who knows if she's going to hold that against Mr. Weinstein?' Aidala argued.
She also was likely to identify with models who would testify at the trial, the defense attorney insisted.
'She was Miss Swimsuit New York,' Aidala said.




The jury will hear opening statements on Wednesday, and the trial is expected to last until early March.
Prosecutors from the Manhattan District Attorney's Office are expected to call three accusers cited in the indictment plus three other women to support Weinstein's alleged history of prior bad acts.
Weinstein's team is expected to aggressively challenge the credibility of his accusers, who include a woman who accused him of raping her at a Manhattan hotel in 2013. Former production assistant Mimi Haleyi has gone public with her story that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006.
Joining them on the roster of witnesses is 'Sopranos' actress Annabella Sciorra, whose allegations are covered in the predatory sexual assault counts. She has also made public her allegation that Weinstein raped her at her Gramercy Park apartment in 1993.
None of the women accusing him came forward to law enforcement before the bombshell reports in October 2017 by the New York Times and the New Yorker that outed Weinstein as an alleged sexual abuser.
The defense is likely to say that women in Hollywood willingly had sex with him, hoping for acting roles and other assistance in return.
One of the supporting witnesses in his case is part of the Los Angeles prosecution. She was allegedly assaulted by Weinstein at a hotel in Beverly Hills in February 2013.
That woman was working as an actress and model at the time. She sought nothing from Weinstein and 'was not looking for a job in America,' her lawyer David Ring said recently.
'The first time she met him she didn't even know who he was. A mutual friend introduced her to him at a film festival,' Ring said. 'Later on at night she goes back to her hotel . . . [and] she gets a phone call and he's in the lobby demanding to come up and see her.'
The attorney, whose client is not suing Weinstein, said the movie mogul's tactics were similar to what he allegedly used against Italian model Ambra Battilana, who reported to the New York police in 2015 that he grabbed her breast at his Tribeca office. Battilana confronted Weinstein on instruction from police investigators and the interaction was recorded.

The Manhattan district attorney decided five years ago they did not have enough information to go forward with a misdemeanor sex abuse case for the groping.
After #MeToo broke, the office came under fire for not prosecuting Weinstein.

Texto completo: The last thing the Recording Academy wanted, or needed, heading into the 2020 Grammy Awards ceremony next week was more turmoil.
Yet that's precisely what it got late Thursday when the advocacy organization that oversees the annual awards ceremony and accompanying prime-time CBS telecast placed its newly installed president and chief executive, Deborah Dugan, on "administrative leave" amid allegations of misconduct.
In return, Dugan's lawyer fired back that she is prepared to "expose what happens when you 'step up' at the Recording Academy," a pointed reference to a remark made by former Recording Academy Chief Executive Neil Portnow that was roundly derided as sexist.

The news of Dugan's exit blindsided many in the music industry as well as those at the 62-year-old organization, which is barely a week from the Jan. 26 Grammy ceremony that will bring thousands of musicians, songwriters, producers, engineers, record company executives and fans together at Staples Center in Los Angeles to celebrate "music's biggest night."
The Recording Academy said its move was necessary despite the impending ceremony because of the seriousness of the allegation against Dugan. The academy's statement did not detail the allegation, but a New York Times report characterized it as "bullying."
It was leveled by "a senior female member of the Recording Academy team," according to a statement the academy issued Thursday, which added that the organization's board of trustees "has also retained two independent third-party investigators to conduct independent investigations of the allegations."
Dugan retains her title but will remain on administrative leave while the investigations are ongoing, an academy spokesperson said. Board chairman Harvey Mason Jr. is serving as interim president.
A source close to Dugan characterized the complaint as "a routine HR matter."
An academy spokesman said the woman's complaint about Dugan was filed to the executive committee of the academy's board of trustees before Dugan herself raised allegations of wrongdoing.
Dugan submitted a memo less than a month ago, reportedly to the organization's human resources department, detailing her concerns about practices she had discovered including voting irregularities, financial mismanagement, "exorbitant and unnecessary" legal fees and "conflicts of interest involving members of the academy's board, executive committee and outside lawyers," according to a New York Times report.
"You knew that Deb was going to face a lot of organizational challenges going into this," said an entertainment industry veteran with knowledge of the workings of an independent task force created in 2018 to examine issues of gender and racial bias in the music industry and Recording Academy. "I do know the frustration level she was struggling against with this very incestuous, archaic, cronied organizational structure between the board and the [academy's regional] chapters."
A source with knowledge of the academy's leadership spoke critically of Dugan's executive skills. "She didn't have the qualities or experience to run the organization. She felt she was hired to restructure the Grammys. Somehow she got the message that's what she was there for. But she never stopped to learn how things work."
The episode has highlighted a clash of cultures that is rocking not just the music industry or even the broader entertainment world, but companies of all stripes in the #MeToo and Time's Up era.
"I honestly believe the reports we're seeing [about Dugan's allegations] have a degree of veracity to them," said another longtime Recording Academy member who, like others, insisted on anonymity to speak freely. "It is hard to change. Is she a bully? I have no idea. But if she was a dude who was coming in, would it be characterized differently?"
The bombshell developments grew out of efforts the academy began in earnest after the 2018 Grammy ceremony. That's when then-President and Chief Executive Portnow said backstage, in response to a question about the predominance of male award recipients that evening, that the time had come for women to "step up" to achieve parity. The remark prompted pop star Pink, among others, to call for Portnow to "step down" for the tone-deaf comment on factors working against women in the music industry. Portnow said the comment was taken out of context and quickly attempted to walk it back but announced in the weeks after the incident that he would indeed step down after his contract ended in 2019.
The immediate response was the formation of a 15-woman, three-man task force headed by Michelle Obama's former chief of staff, Tina Tchen, which made 18 specific recommended changes, some of them striking at fundamental elements of the organization's operations, in its final report issued in December.
Among the many findings was that not only was there little diversity among the academy's 40-member board, but the same was evident on the special committees that review recordings submitted for award consideration. Thus, committees that even in recent years remain overwhelmingly male and white ultimately have been deciding which recordings and artists make it to the nomination circle, affecting the makeup of winners to a large extent.
"It's an old-boys network," the source close to the task force said.
Portnow's departure led to the hiring of Dugan, who previously worked with U2 singer Bono at the AIDS nonprofit organization (Red) that was founded in 2006. Before that she held top positions at Disney Publishing Worldwide and EMI/Capitol Records after spending years as a Wall Street lawyer.
Despite her history with music-related firms, Dugan was viewed as an outsider by many in an industry that doesn't routinely welcome them. Former NBC News chief Andrew Lack encountered significant resistance when he took over as head of Sony Music Entertainment in 2003. English financier Guy Hands was roundly pilloried for his handling of EMI Music when his Terra Firma private equity firm acquired it in 2007 and lost an estimated $2.5 billion when Citigroup took over the music conglomerate in 2011.
Dugan started her duties guiding the Recording Academy in August at the same time musician-producer Mason was installed as new chairman of the board of trustees, signaling the potential for change under new top leadership.
Just last week, in an interview with The Times, she spoke in upbeat terms about the opportunity given her to lead the academy into a new era following Portnow's 17-year tenure at the top.
"Everything's being examined," she said. "What are our values in 2020?" She also expressed a desire for greater transparency at the organization, whose methods for determining which recordings are singled out each year for nominations and awards remain a mystery to many.
Bringing change would necessarily present risks. As Dugan put it last week, "I think people are excited. But you know what? Change is disorienting. You start thinking, 'Hmm, what's that mean for me?' "
As it happened, Dugan reportedly often was at odds with Mason. Some academy officials were put off by a "very different management style" than they had become accustomed to during Portnow's reign, and bristled at the change. Others, however, praised the new energy and ideas she brought.
Some of those ideas spoke to building of community and sensitivity to members' feelings, which also generated complaints in some quarters.
"She wanted to take down walls and thought everybody should work in one communal space," one source said. "There was a lot of kumbaya type stuff, like 'Let's get together and hold hands.' She wanted everyone to take the train [from the academy's West Los Angeles offices] down to Staples Center as a group."
The palace intrigue, however, is not expected to spill over into the Grammy telecast, which will be hosted again by musician Alicia Keys and at which emerging artists Billie Eilish and Lizzo are leading the nominations this year.

Texto completo: A new nature series debuts on four cable networks, and Apple TV Plus highlights immigrant stories in "Little America."
What's on TV
SEVEN WORLDS, ONE PLANET 9 p.m. on AMC, BBC America, IFC and Sundance TV. This new nature documentary series is narrated by none other than the veteran broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough. Each of the seven episodes spotlights how life developed on a different continent, as well as the factors threatening its biodiversity. This premiere focuses on Australia and its native animals, such as the eastern grey kangaroo and the Tasmanian devil. (The episode was filmed before bush fires started ravaging large swaths of the country but includes information on how to support relief efforts.) There is certainly no shortage of nature documentaries out there -- some scenes in "Seven Worlds" have already been featured in the Netflix series "Our Planet." Even so, in his review for The New York Times, Mike Hale wrote that "'Seven Worlds' is full of the usual beauty and spectacle."
GODZILLA: KING OF THE MONSTERS (2019) 8 p.m. on HBO; stream on HBO platforms. If the grand visual effects of kaiju films are enough to keep you glued to the screen, this sequel to "Godzilla" (2014) is worth a watch. That is to say that it may not offer much in terms of dialogue or story, but it does propel the franchise forward and set the stage for "Godzilla vs. Kong," due in November. Directed by Michael Dougherty, "King of the Monsters" sees the rise of Monster Zero, who turns out to be King Ghidorah -- a three-headed creature that summons other kaiju to destroy the world. Ghidorah comes up against Godzilla and Mothra, while a broken family (played by Mark Russell, Vera Farmiga and Millie Bobby Brown) takes sides in the monster showdown.
What's Streaming
[Video: Watch on YouTube.]
LITTLE AMERICA Stream on Apple TV Plus. This new anthology series may not have the star power of Apple TV Plus's "The Morning Show," but it does have the draw of true stories that are relevant as ever in today's political climate. (And support from producers like Kumail Nanjiani and Alan Yang doesn't hurt.) Inspired by a series of articles in Epic Magazine about immigrants in the United States, the eight-part first season features episodes on a baker from Uganda who opens her own business; an Indian boy whose parents are deported, leaving him in charge of their motel; and a gay Syrian refugee who is granted asylum. Each tale touches on hardships and triumphs, both big and small, that make up the immigrant experience. And there's more stories to come: The show was renewed for a second season before it even debuted on Jan. 17.
SEX EDUCATION Stream on Netflix. This charming British comedy centers on an awkward high school student (Asa Butterfield) who uses the wisdom he's gleaned from his mother, a sex therapist, to start a sex therapy clinic at his school. In Season 2, he navigates a new relationship and considers stepping away from the business.

Texto completo: Inheriting a moribund program, he led the Spartans to Big Ten titles and a Rose Bowl victory and later coached the Steelers' "Steel Curtain" defense.
George Perles, who coached Michigan State to two Big Ten titles and a Rose Bowl victory in 1988 and was an assistant for the dominant Pittsburgh Steelers teams of the 1970s, died on Jan. 7 at his home in East Lansing, Mich. He was 85.
The university announced his death. He had been treated for Parkinson's disease since 2017.
Perles played football at Michigan State and was later an assistant coach before leaving to join the Steelers' coaching staff in 1972. He returned to Michigan State a decade later as head coach and later became athletic director and a member of the school's governing body.
Michigan State brought him back to revive its beleaguered football program, and he did just that, winning Big Ten titles in 1987 and 1990 and coaching the school in seven bowl games. He helped the Spartans beat Southern California, 20-16, on Jan. 1, 1988, for their first Rose Bowl win in more than three decades.
That game capped his best season with Michigan State, when the linebacker Percy Snow led the defense and the running back Lorenzo White and the receiver Andre Rison powered the offense as the Spartans captured sole possession of the 1987 Big Ten title with a record of 9-2-1. (They shared the title in 1990.) All three went on to play in the N.F.L.
The Steelers' head coach, Chuck Noll, hired Perles away from the Spartans to oversee Pittsburgh's vaunted "Steel Curtain" defensive line, led by the Hall of Fame tackle Joe Greene. Perles was later defensive coordinator and assistant head coach for the Steelers as they rolled to four N.F.L. championships in six years.
He returned to Michigan State, in East Lansing, in 1983. The Green Bay Packers tried to lure him back to the N.F.L. shortly after his Rose Bowl victory, and the New York Jets tried to do the same two years later. Both times Perles leveraged the opportunities to get what he wanted at Michigan State.
He signed a 10-year contract with the Spartans after passing on the chance to lead the Packers. On the eve of being introduced as the Jets' head coach in 1990, he was named the university's athletic director.
He was fired as coach late in the 1994 season, when Michigan State finished 5-6. After an N.C.A.A. investigation, the Spartans forfeited their games because of an academic scandal, but Perles himself was cleared.
"I would have taken the job with Green Bay (in 1988) or with the Jets (in 1990) if I had known what was coming," he wrote in a 1995 memoir, "George Perles: The Ride of a Lifetime."
He remained in Michigan for the rest of his life, helping to create the Motor City Bowl and serving on the Michigan State board of trustees from 2006 to 2018. His coaching record in 12 seasons at Michigan State was 73-62-4 overall and 58-37-2 in the Big Ten.
In 2018, a California woman accused Perles in a lawsuit of covering up a rape by Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for Michigan State and the national gymnastics team. The woman said that Dr. Nassar had raped her and videotaped the assault while she was a member of the women's field hockey team and that Perles, who was head football coach and athletic director at the time, had covered it up when told about it.
Nassar was later convicted of multiple counts of rape and sexual abuse. But a state investigator's report found "no credible evidence" to support the claim against Perles, who was not listed as a defendant in the suit.
George Julius Perles was born on July 16, 1934, in Detroit and starred on the baseball and football teams at Western High School there, earning all-state honors in football. In 1954 he began a two-year stint in the Army before enrolling at Michigan State.
He was briefly a lineman for the Spartans until a knee injury ended his career. He then became a student assistant to the coach, Duffy Daugherty. He graduated in 1960.
After coaching high school ball and serving as an assistant at the University of Dayton, he returned to Michigan State as an assistant to Daugherty in 1967.
He is survived by his wife, Sally; their children, Kathy, Terry, John and Patrick; and six grandchildren.

Who has the right to write? Jeanine Cummins' 'American Dirt' sparks conversations about the politics of fiction.

Texto completo: What led Jeanine Cummins to finally decide to write "American Dirt" was her desire to change the public discourse around immigration in the United States -- though from the beginning, she wondered whether she could.
"I wished someone slightly browner than me would write it," she wrote in an unusually long author's note at the end of the novel. "But then I thought, if you're a person who has the capacity to be a bridge, why not be a bridge? So I began."
"American Dirt" is the story of Lydia and her 8-year-old son, Luca, who are fleeing from their home in Acapulco, Mexico, after a drug cartel kills more than a dozen of their family members during a quinceanera. They flee north on a treacherous, 2,645-mile journey, disguising themselves as migrants in an effort to cross the border.

Slated to hit shelves Jan. 21, Cummins' novel about the border crisis has already sparked a cacophony of reactions from writers across the United States. Some have praised Cummins for humanizing the migrant tale, and for sending a timely and important message to the world about the United States' failing immigration policies. Others have said the book is riddled with stereotypes and cliches, that it's inaccurate and an act of appropriation. (Rigoberto Gonzalez's review for The Times falls somewhere in between.)
In sum, the book has raised divisive questions about censorship, representation and the politics of fiction, homing in on a single dilemma: Who has the right to tell certain stories?
"None of us have the right or not the right to write about it," said Norma Iglesias-Prieto, professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at San Diego State University, whom Cummins consulted and cited in her author's note. "I think everyone has the right to write about a particular topic even if you are not part of this community," Iglesias-Prieto added.
Not everyone agrees. On the other end of these conversations are arguments that only writers from minority and marginalized backgrounds truly own stories about those communities. "Jeanine Cummins' narco-novel, 'American Dirt,' is a literary licuado [smoothie] that tastes like its title," writes Myriam Gurba in a scathing review of the book on the website Tropics of Meta. Later, she asserts that "'American Dirt' fails to convey any Mexican sensibility. It aspires to be Dia de los Muertos but it instead embodies Halloween."
For some critics of "American Dirt," the problem is Cummins herself. Born in Spain and raised in a working-class family in Maryland, Cummins is not a Mexican national. She's of mixed ethnicity and has family roots in Puerto Rico; she identifies as Latina and white. Critics have questioned whether she was able to accurately convey the experience of Mexican migrants.

Storytelling debate
Mexican American poet David Bowles contends that Cummins' effort to write about Mexican culture as a woman of Puerto Rican heritage was presumptuous. He took to Twitter on Monday to express his frustration and called "American Dirt" "appropriating, inaccurate, torture-porn about Mexico" that was "deliberately written with white folks in mind."
Gurba had similar thoughts. In her withering critique, she claims the book teems with "overly-ripe Mexican stereotypes" about "the Latin lover, the suffering mother, and the stoic manchild" while painting Mexico as a country awash in violence, drug cartels and corruption.
In a phone interview, Gurba recalled reading the book's opening murder scene and thinking: "This is absolutely a Trumpian fantasy of Mexico." Gurba, who is of Mexican heritage, added, "We're perfectly competent and perfectly capable of telling stories" but "gatekeepers do not allow us inside, but they will let in somebody who wants to usurp our voice."
In response to the negative reviews, publisher and executive vice president of Flatiron Books Amy Einhorn issued a statement to The Times that emphasized the novel's broad support, saying in part, "We are extremely proud to be publishing 'American Dirt' and are thrilled that some of the biggest names in Latinx literature are championing the novel."
Notable Latinas and Mexican American writers have endorsed the novel. Sandra Cisneros, esteemed author of "The House on Mango Street," called it "masterful," "the great novel of las Americas" and "the international story of our times." Julia Alvarez ("How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents") hailed it as "riveting, timely, a dazzling accomplishment" and said it had the power to "change hearts and transform policies."
Cummins has repeatedly expressed her reluctance to write about Mexico and the immigrant experience. She writes in her author's note that she worried her privilege would make her "blind to certain truths," that she might get things wrong. And in a New York Times profile Monday, she told an interviewer, "I don't know if I'm the right person to tell this story."
Cummins researched and wrote the book over a span of four years. She drew on the work of Valeria Luiselli, Luis Alberto Urrea and others to learn about Mexico and the struggles of migrants. She took trips to Mexico and interviewed people on both sides of the border. She spoke to scholars and lawyers, activists and migrants in shelters, and families separated at the border.
--
Sing her praises
Those who have commended Cummins' book have praised its gripping prose and plot, its timeliness and character development. Author Don Winslow compared "American Dirt" to John Steinbeck's 1930s magnum opus about the Great Depression, calling Cummins' novel "a 'Grapes of Wrath' for our times."
Stephen King called it "marvelous" and "one hell of a novel." His son, writer Joe Hill, recommended the "relentless thriller" to his Twitter followers.
In a phone interview, Iglesias-Prieto argued that "American Dirt" humanizes the lives of people who are typically "invisible" and "treated as facts." From her perspective, Cummins' rich, multidimensional characters help shatter stereotypes that have existed for decades: that Latinos are criminals, rapists or unintelligent. "I think she's contributing to [breaking stereotypes] by developing very complex characters with real dilemmas, with history, with names, with family, with dreams."
Some writers won't take the risk of telling sensitive stories for fear of getting it wrong. Jonathan Franzen has said that he won't write about race because he doesn't have "firsthand experience" with it. Yet others contend that being a member of a certain community or having had direct involvement with it shouldn't be a prerequisite to writing about it.
Novelist Colson Whitehead, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel "The Underground Railroad," came to a more complicated conclusion. He urged the audience at a writers conference in Portland last year to write what they didn't know. "Tackle a story that you're scared to begin, that you don't know if you can pull off." But he warned them to proceed with care: "You can write about anything," Whitehead said, "just don't f-- it up."
With that major caveat in mind, Cummins and others are considering it a risk worth taking. Because sometimes, as Iglesias-Prieto put it, "It's better to speak with a more human perspective than not speak at all."

Texto completo: The name change means consumers won't mistakenly connect the Disney-owned studio with Mr. Murdoch's polarizing Fox News.
LOS ANGELES -- Sound the trumpets: 20th Century Fox, a name and klieg-lit logo that stretches back 85 years in Hollywood, is dropping the word Fox, a move that may prevent consumers from mistakenly thinking the movie studio has anything to do with Rupert Murdoch's polarizing Fox News media empire.
The Walt Disney Company bought most of Mr. Murdoch's entertainment assets last year in a $ 71.3 billion deal. That included the 20th Century Fox studio and its art-house sibling, Fox Searchlight. On Friday, employees at the main movie studio arrived to a new email format (@20thcenturystudios) without the Fox. A Disney spokesman confirmed that both labels, now officially known as 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, would drop Fox from their logos. Disney had no further comment.
"Downhill," a comedic drama starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, will be the first movie to bear the Searchlight Pictures name. It arrives in theaters on Feb. 14. "The Call of the Wild," set for release on Feb. 21 and starring Harrison Ford, will carry the 20th Century logo. The trumpet fanfare (composed by Alfred Newman in 1933), klieg lights and familiar monolith logo will remain.
It is not surprising that Disney would rename the movie operations. In October, 20th Century Fox Television, a small-screen studio that Disney bought as part of the deal, became part of a new entity, Disney Television Studios.
Mr. Murdoch still owns the Fox broadcast network, Fox News and a chain of 28 local Fox television stations, among other media assets. His new company is called Fox Corporation, and one of his sons, Lachlan Murdoch, is chief executive. (The old company was called 21st Century Fox.)
The Fox brand became synonymous with Mr. Murdoch starting in the mid-1980s, when he bought a stake in the 20th Century Fox movie studio and founded the Fox broadcast network to compete with ABC, CBS and NBC. He eventually took full control of the movie studio. Fox News arrived on the cable scene in 1996 as an alternative to CNN and grew into a behemoth that dwarfed the film company as a moneymaker.
Fox News remains a media superpower, but its brand has become a polarizing one. The network's founding chairman, Roger Ailes, and one of its most popular on-air personalities, Bill O'Reilly, became the focus of sexual harassment scandals in recent years. Its prime-time opinion hosts are vocal supporters of President Trump.
Hollywood figures have grown more vocal in their criticism of Fox News. In 2018, for instance, Steve Levitan, the creator of "Modern Family," which airs on ABC but is produced by the Fox studio that Disney now owns, wrote on Twitter that he was "disgusted to work at a company that has anything whatsoever to do with @FoxNews." His comments came amid the 24-hour news channel's coverage of the Trump administration's border security policy.
Movies have been branded with the Fox name for more than a century. The name dates to 1915, when William Fox, a Hungarian immigrant, left the fur and garment industry to start a motion picture company. The 1929 stock market crash, among other misfortunes, forced the Fox Film Corporation to merge with a competitor, Twentieth Century Pictures, to form 20th Century Fox in 1935. The combined company made such Hollywood classics as "The Sound of Music," "All About Eve," "Alien" and "Die Hard."
Also on Friday, Disney ended a lavish film-production deal with Peter Chernin, who was once Mr. Murdoch's second in command. The decade-old agreement was with 20th Century Fox, which released Chernin Entertainment-produced films and paid for all or part of the costs. Films made under the deal included the recent "Planet of the Apes" trilogy and the current Oscar nominee "Ford v Ferrari."
Mr. Chernin told The New York Times in 2018 that he had about six years remaining on the deal. But the alliance no longer made sense under Disney, which generally does not share ownership of films and plans to pare down 20th Century's release slate to focus almost entirely on franchise movies. Disney and Chernin Entertainment will continue to work together on a handful of those, including a new "Planet of the Apes" film.
"I have nothing but praise for Disney," Mr. Chernin said in a statement. "They were gracious, classy and paved the way for me to continue to build the company however we want."
The news about Chernin Entertainment was first reported by Variety.

Texto completo: Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that the payments to Canadian families of victims do not absolve Iran from providing compensation.
OTTAWA -- Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that his government will offer payments to relatives of the dozens of Canadian citizens and permanent residents killed when a Ukrainian airliner was downed by missiles launched by Iranian forces.
At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trudeau said the payments are an interim measure and that Canada will not abandon its efforts to make Iran provide substantial compensation to the families of the victims.
He said that Iran bears full responsibility for the incident.
"I want to be clear: we expect Iran to compensate these families," Mr. Trudeau said. "But I have met them, they can't wait weeks. They need support now."
Canada will provide each of the families with 25,000 Canadian dollars, about $ 19,000, to cover the cost of funerals and travel. The prime minister said that 57 of the victims were Canadian citizens and another 29 were permanent residents of the country.
Canada does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and relies on Italy as its representative there. Members of Canada's Transportation Safety Board are participating in the investigation that Iran is leading into the downing.
For three days, Iran claimed that the airplane, Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752, had crashed due to mechanical problems, despite the findings of various intelligence services that the plane was shot down. Iran then reversed its denial, admitting that a member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps -- a powerful, hard-line military force -- mistook the plane for a cruise missile.
Videos verified by The New York Times indicate that two missiles struck the airliner before it crashed.
In the week since the disaster, Mr. Trudeau and several senior members of his cabinet have been crisscrossing the country to meet with relatives of the victims and attend public vigils.
The prime minister has stayed out of a growing debate within the country over whether President Trump shares some of the responsibility for the deaths by creating a volatile situation in Iran that some argue led to the downing.
Canada expects the first remains of victims to arrive soon, Mr. Trudeau said. He also urged Iran to send the damaged cockpit voice and flight data recorders from the airliner to France for downloading and analysis.

Steady Support So Far for Biden, but It Might Not Last

Texto completo: Mr. Biden has largely relied on the perception that he is the best-positioned candidate to beat President Trump.
Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign has been defined by what it's not as much as by what it is. He hasn't made waves with big-ticket policy proposals, and he has mostly avoided skirmishing with his Democratic rivals.
And so, nine months into his campaign, Mr. Biden is in a remarkably similar position to where he was when he began: He's the presumptive front-runner, despite a lack of agenda-setting plans or breathless enthusiasm from supporters.
Poll results can help us understand why. For one thing, Democratic voters appear to want a candidate who they think has a good chance of beating President Trump more than one whose policy views sync up perfectly with their own.
In a Monmouth University poll last month, this question was put to likely Democratic primary voters nationwide: Would you prefer a strong nominee who could defeat Mr. Trump, even if you disagree with that candidate on most issues -- or a candidate with whom you see eye to eye, but who would have difficulty overcoming the president?
Almost twice as many respondents chose the candidate with a better chance of winning.
Polls suggest that Mr. Biden's support is built largely on these very voters, who are seeking an experienced leader to reverse the Trump administration's policies.
In a CNN poll last month, 40 percent of likely Democratic voters who responded said they thought Mr. Biden would be the strongest candidate against Mr. Trump. Only 16 percent pointed to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Biden's closest rival.
Democrats across demographics tend to agree that beating Mr. Trump is the main priority. As a result, Mr. Biden has built a remarkably broad coalition of voters, with support cutting across race, gender and educational background.
But a degree of insecurity still lingers. The former vice president has faced strikingly few challenges from his rivals or from debate moderators in recent months -- a boon to his candidacy that could evaporate if his opponents' tactics change.
"A core part of his support has never been driven by enthusiasm for him -- it's driven by a sense that he's the safe choice," said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.
"Unlike Sanders, whose core support is very much gung-ho for him and knows what they signed up for, Biden's supporters are looking for the strongest candidate," Mr. Murray added. "He has so far survived that examination, but that doesn't mean it can't change over the next few weeks."
Indeed, Mr. Biden's support dipped for weeks in the fall amid a surge from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was seen as possibly more capable of uniting the moderate and left wings of the Democratic Party. But her polling numbers began to waver after her support for "Medicare for all" drew criticism, and much of Mr. Biden's support appeared to stabilize.
Democratic voters have grown more liberal over the past two decades, but moderates now feel more alienated from an increasingly ideological Republican Party than they did a generation ago. As a result, moderate voters still tend to lean Democratic, and they make up a big enough share of the party to play a decisive role in choosing its nominee.
"You have a lot of Democrats who are not beholden to an ideological position but feel comfortable with him," Mr. Murray said of Mr. Biden. "They're coming from all walks of life."
About as many women support Mr. Biden as do men, and he is the most popular candidate among black Democratic voters -- a key constituency, particularly in the primaries. (Mr. Sanders has encroached on that lead, however, and now trails by less than 10 points among African-American voters and other nonwhite voters, according to some national polls.)
Just as crucially, Mr. Biden's numbers are as strong among white voters without college degrees as they are among those with a higher education. That puts him at a distinct advantage over Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., two of his strongest opponents.
And while Mr. Biden's supporters tend to be slightly more moderate than other candidates' backers, they are generally paying attention to the same issues. They are most likely to list health care as their main policy concern, with climate change second, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Those results are consistent with the party's voters at large.
Mr. Biden has also benefited from the fact that Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to be looking for a leader with solid political experience, according to a multilevel analysis of voter preferences published this month by Monmouth. Mr. Biden, who was first elected to the Senate 48 years ago, is by far the most popular candidate among Democrats who prioritize experience in a nominee: Forty-four percent of such voters back him, the Monmouth analysis found.
Finding an experienced leader matters particularly to voters of color, especially women of color, the study found.
Mr. Biden's one major vulnerability is among young people. Polls of Iowa, New Hampshire and the nation at large consistently find him polling below 20 percent among voters under 50.
And if he does not rack up decisive victories in the earliest-voting states over the coming two months, he could be vulnerable to the growing challenge of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who entered the race in late November and is not competing in the earliest states.
Polls show that Mr. Bloomberg is strongest among older voters, black people and moderate or conservative Democrats -- all crucial elements of Mr. Biden's coalition.

Texto completo: NEW YORK — Rocky Johnson, the hard-bodied professional wrestler known as Soul Man who battled racism early in his career and later helped train his son, actor Dwayne “The Rock" Johnson, has died. He was 75.
His death was announced Wednesday in a statement by World Wrestling Entertainment. No cause was given.
Former professional wrestler Brian Blair, another 1980s WWE star, went to church with Mr. Johnson in the Tampa area. He told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson had complained of an unspecified illness of late and had missed church that he attended with Blair and other former wrestlers.
"He thought he had the flu or something," Blair said by phone. "I said, 'You, need to get checked out, Rocky.' He said he'd be OK. . . . I talked to (his wife) Sheila and she said he was just being stubborn. He died at home."
Mr. Johnson rose from small-town Canada to fame in the 1980s as a muscular wrestler who bounded off the ropes, delivered punishing jabs, and called himself “the king of the dropkick" for his ability to dispatch opponents with that singular move.
His opponents included well-known figures in the professional wrestling world, such as Greg “The Hammer" Valentine, Don Muraco, and Adrian Adonis. But he was perhaps best known for pairing with another black wrestler, Tony Atlas, in a tag team known as the Soul Patrol.
The two became the first black world tag team champions in WWE history when they defeated the Wild Samoans on Dec. 10, 1983, according to World Wrestling Entertainment, which released a video clip of some of Mr. Johnson's highlights Wednesday.
In an interview with thehannibaltv.com, Mr. Johnson recalled the many successes he had in a career that took him around the world, but said there was also racism in professional wrestling, “then as it is now."
“Now, it's more covered up," Mr. Johnson said in the interview. “But there was a lot."
Mr. Johnson said he fought against such prejudice, refusing to take part in some degrading performances.
“I was headstrong," he said in the interview. “I kept myself in shape and the stuff they were doing in the South, I wouldn't go for. They wanted to whip me on TV, like they used to do with the slaves and all that. I said, 'No. I came in as an athlete, and I'll leave as an athlete.' And they respected me for that."
When his son showed an interest in wrestling, Mr. Johnson said, he offered to train him.
“ 'I'm going to train you 150 percent,' " Mr. Johnson recalled telling his son, in the interview with thehannibaltv.com. “And I was hard on him. But he never gave up."
Born Wayde Douglas Bowles on Aug. 24, 1944, Mr. Johnson grew up in Amherst, Nova Scotia, and moved to Toronto as a teenager. He boxed as a young man and recalled sparring with George Foreman and Muhammad Ali.
He adopted the name Rocky Johnson, he said, as a tribute to two of his favorite boxing greats: Rocky Marciano and Jack Johnson, the first black heavyweight boxing champion.
Mr. Johnson's sports-entertainment career began in the mid-1960s with the National Wrestling Alliance. But he found his greatest success when he began his tenure with what is now the WWE in 1983, the company said.
Mr. Johnson retired from the ring in 1991.

Texto completo: The latest character to emerge in the shadow campaign to coerce Ukrainian officials to investigate presidential contender Joe Biden is an obscure 40-year old Connecticut man who was taken into custody last year at President Donald Trump’s Doral golf resort for mental health treatment and has claimed on social media to be a member of Mar-a-Lago, according to recent news reports.
Robert F. Hyde was thrust into the Ukraine inquiry when cryptic text messages were released by House Democrats on Tuesday. The messages suggested that Hyde had been secretly tracking the movements of Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.
Yovanovitch offered some of the most damning testimony in the House
impeachment hearings into the allegation that Trump withheld military aid to the Ukraine unless officials in Kyiv launched an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Biden and his son, Hunter, to boost the president’s reelection effort.
“Wow. Can’t believe Trumo [sic] hasn’t fired this b----,” Hyde wrote in an encrypted message to Lev Parnas, a former associate of Rudy Giuliani and a Boca Raton resident, on March 23. “I’ll get right [on] that.”
In the messages, Hyde said he had contact with a “private security” team near the embassy in Kyiv that was apparently monitoring Yovanovitch.
“She’s talked to three people. Her phone is off. Computer is off,” he wrote in one message. “They will let me know when she’s on the move,” he said in another.
“They are willing to help if we/you would like a price,” Hyde wrote in another note. “Guess you can do anything in the Ukraine with money . . . what I was told.”
Parnas told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow on Wednesday that he did not believe Hyde’s claim that Yovanovitch was under surveillance.
“When he sent me those, I got disturbed,” Parnas said. “I was like, oh, this is crazy. Is this guy off the wall?”
Parnas chuckled when Maddow asked, “Who is Robert Hyde?” describing Hyde as a “weird character.”
"He was either drunk or trying to make himself bigger than he was,” Parnas said.
Shortly after the documents were released, however, Hyde joked about
the exchanges with Parnas, who also said Wednesday he was directed by Giuliani, the president’s private attorney, to force Ukrainian officials to investigate the Bidens.
“How low can liddle Adam Bull Schiff go? I was never in Kiev,” one message from Hyde read. “For them to take some texts my buddy’s and I wrote back to some dweeb we were playing with that we met a few times while we had a few drinks is definitely laughable. Schiff is a desperate turd playing with this Lev guy.”
Officials at Ukraine’s Interior Ministry took Hyde’s claims seriously. On Thursday, they opened an investigation into possible illegal surveillance of Yovanovitch, based on Hyde’s messages to Parnas.
Also on Thursday, FBI investigators visited both Hyde’s home and business in Avon, Connecticut, CNN reported.
How Hyde, owner of a landscape company and a Marine reserve veteran, ended up hobnobbing with GOP luminaries and allegedly sleuthing for characters in the Ukraine drama is not known.
Hyde could have gained access, in part, because of the more than $35,000 he donated to Trump’s campaign, inaugural committee and other national GOP groups, according to Federal Election Commission campaign finance data.
Hyde began making donations in September 2016, about a month after he sold his mother’s home in Delray Beach for $675,000, according to court records. Hyde’s mother died in January 2014,
Most of what is known about Hyde comes from abundant posts on his social media accounts that are chock-full of photos of Hyde posing with GOP politicians, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and conservative notables, such as Roger Stone.
Hyde made his Congressmanhyde2020 Instagram account private this week after the trove of messages was released and he found himself the subject of news headlines.
By then, however, Zach Everson, an independent journalist who publishes the 1100 Pennsylvania newsletter, had captured many of Hyde’s posts with the president or at Trump properties. Five of those posts show Hyde with the president at Trump International Golf Club in suburban West Palm Beach and at Mar-a-Lago.
In an Instagram post on Nov. 11, Hyde claims that the president shook the hand of a new Mar-a-Lago club member that Hyde sponsored in April 2019. Prospective members at Mar-a-Lago must be sponsored by an existing member, meaning Hype purported being the new member’s sponsor.
Hyde also posted a video of the event. In it, Hyde can be heard calling out to the president, inviting him to welcome the club’s new member, Cheng Gao, a major GOP donor who contributed $237,000 to the Trump campaign and other financial groups, according to a report by Mother Jones magazine.
Gao is described in campaign finance records as a “Buddhist artist,” according to the report. Gao recently moved to the United States from China and, with his wife, moved into an apartment in Trump Tower in New York several months after Trump entered the White House, according to Mother Jones.
Hyde’s connection to Gao was revealed on a financial disclosure form Hyde filed last year in connection with his long-shot congressional bid in Connecticut, according to Mother Jones. In it, Hyde noted that he has been a public relations consultant for Gao.
— On July 21, 2019, Hyde posted a group shot at Mar-a-Lago in front of the famous portrait of a younger Trump in tennis togs.
— On Aug. 22, 2019, Hyde posted a selfie with Trump in the ballroom at Mar-a-Lago and announcing his bid for Congress.
— On Oct. 14, Hyde re-posted the photo, indicating it was taken on Easter Sunday 2019.
— On Oct. 15 and 17, 2019, Hyde posted photos with the president at Trump International Golf Club in suburban West Palm Beach.
— On Nov. 17, 2019, he posted a still image from the video he shot of him urging the president to shake the hand of Gao, the club’s “newest member,” whom Hyde said he sponsored in April
Hyde made a scene at another Trump property in South Florida, the Trump National Doral golf resort near Miami. Last May, two months after Hyde and Parnas exchanged messages, the police responded to the Trump resort, where Hyde told officers that he feared a hit man was going to kill him, records show, according to The New York Times.
Hyde told the police that the Secret Service and a hit man were after him and that painters and landscapers at the resort were also plotting against him, according to a report by Mother Jones. Hyde told police that “e-mails he sent” may have placed his life in jeopardy, although the report did not note the subject of the emails, according to Mother Jones’ reporting.
The night before the incident, Hyde sent Mother Jones a long, rambling text message in which he boasted of his role in helping Trump during the 2016 campaign and implied that his life was at risk.
Hyde noted, “I paid alot to Facebook for boosting ads for the Trump campaign day one. One add the day of the election went to 26.2 million people.” He insisted, “Never in a million years would I collude with Russians!! I love my country.” And he wrote, “If something was to happen to me, connect the dots.”

D.C. Memo: Iowa is where we are

Texto completo: The D.C. Memo is a weekly recap of Washington political news, journalism, and opinion, delivered with an eye toward what matters for Minnesota. Sign up to get it in your inbox every Thursday.
Welcome to this week’s edition of the D.C. Memo. This week from Washington, the impeachment trial in the Senate begins, the Democratic presidential candidates gathered in Des Moines for another debate, and the president’s refugee resettlement policy was temporarily blocked by the courts.
Let’s get on with this.
Impeachment updates
The impeachment trial in the Senate effectively started Thursday, beginning with the reading of both articles of impeachment submitted by the House and the swearing in of Chief Justice John Roberts. Next, the Senate will set the initial groundwork for the trial and proceedings are expected to begin next week.
You can watch the trial on CSPAN.
As the Senate considers whether to review additional evidence and witness testimony as part of the trial, here’s something relevant: The White House violated the law when it held security aid to the Ukraine, according to the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan agency that reports to Congress.
And more: Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, released a trove of impeachment-related information to the House. The documents appear to show a loose network of Trump associates boasting about tracking and spying on former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Ukraine has launched an investigation into the possible illegal surveillance.
The president next door
On Tuesday night, the Democratic debate. Only six candidates were able to meet the threshold to appear on the stage: Minnesota’s own Sen. Amy Klobuchar , Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former mayor Pete Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, and billionaire philanthropist Tom Steyer.
The debate was in Iowa (if you hadn’t noticed), where Klobuchar has staked much of her presidential prospects. “I want to thank you for bringing up Iowa,” Klobuchar told the debate moderators, “because that is where we are.”
Klobuchar has outran and outlasted several candidates, including two other senators, in order to remain on the debate stage. Recent polling places her between 4 and 8 percent in Iowa.
Read more me at MinnPost: Five takeaways from Klobuchar’s performance at the debate.
Refugee resettlement
A federal judge temporarily blocked an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to give local governments more discretion over refugee resettlement this week, saying that giving local authorities the power to decide if they resettle refugees: “flies in the face of clear congressional intent.”
Greta Kaul at MinnPost talks to Rachele King , the state refugee coordinator at the Minnesota Department of Human Services , about how the program works. Read more at MinnPost.
By the numbers
* 23 : The number of Minnesota counties that have explicitly said yes to refugee resettlement, following the executive order by President Trump that gave local governments the authority to decide if they would accept refugee resettlement. Read more from MinnPost’s Greta Kaul and Tom Nehil.
* 20: Percent of likely caucus goers backing Sen. Bernie Sanders, per the latest Des Moines Register poll, conducted by J. Ann Selzer. It’s effectively anyone’s game: Biden has 15 percent, Buttigieg 16 percent, and Warren 17 percent. In this poll, Klobuchar is at 6 percent.
* 12 : The number of town halls held by Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota’s Second District since being elected. Craig will host her 13th townhall in Zumbrota on Saturday.
Berning back home
Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis will be around town on Friday hosting two rallies for Sen. Bernie Sanders presidential campaign: one at the Hennepin County Government building at 8:10AM and one at the University of Minnesota at 11AM.
To kick off the start of early voting in Minnesota, Klobuchar is also hosting her own get-out-the-vote rally on Friday evening at First Avenue in Minneapolis.
Tracking Emmer
Rep. Tom Emmer of the Sixth District had an ethics complaint filed against him by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, who argue that his staff following around members of Congress during impeachment and asking them questions is a violation of House ethics rules.
The complaint alleges “multiple instances in which the NRCC appears to have had its employees or others on its behalf chase and badger Democratic members of Congress in House office buildings.” From Pat Condon at the Strib.
In other news
* A whole bunch of high-profile Minnesotans want to be on the governor’s climate council. Read more at MinnPost.
* Pete Buttigieg’s campaign used Amazon gig-work platform Mechanical Turk, notorious for low pay, for polling.
* Open Secrets has a new report on campaign spending since Citizens United: In the last 10 years, the top 10 donors made $1.2 billion in political donations.
Quote of the week
“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law. OMB withheld funds for a policy reason, which is not permitted under the Impoundment Control Act (ICA). The withholding was not a programmatic delay,” the Government Accountability Office wrote of the withholding of Ukraine funds.

Waterville fire chief says firefighter's hand gesture was due to injury

Texto completo: Waterville's fire chief said Friday that a firefighter who made a hand gesture associated with white power in an official department photo did so unknowingly, and that the gesture was the result of a thumb injury.
There was no extremist intent behind the firefighter's gesture, said Fire Chief Shawn Esler, who said the night before that he planned to investigate to determine the firefighter's intent.
"Members in the photo were interviewed as a part of a normal inquiry and we confirmed no horseplay regarding the 'OK' symbol or any racially charged motivation existed," Esler said. "There was absolutely no reason to believe our firefighter possessed any hatred or tyrannical white power motivation with this photograph."
The firefighter admitted to making the hand gesture, Esler said, but it was because he had injured his thumb superficially during training the same day.
"The gesture was a direct result of an injury to his hand he had received earlier in the day," Esler said. "The firefighter sustained a superficial injury to his thumb while conducting intensive hands on training with self­-contained breathing apparatus."
The firefighter did not report this injury immediately, according to department policy, and supervisors were therefore not aware of it, according to Esler.
"Had any evidence surfaced to support such an allegation of 'white supremacy' or 'racial bias,' our organization (as a whole) would condemn such acts," he said.
The "OK" sign -- with the index finger pressed to the thumb to make a circle and the three other fingers extended -- has been listed as a symbol of hate. It first became associated with white power in 2017, and became more common as white nationalists began using it in public, The New York Times has reported.
The Waterville Fire Department photo had been the cover photo on the department's Facebook page since Tuesday. It took the photo down Thursday night after the BDN asked about it.

Betty White made her theater debut 60 years ago in Lancaster County

Texto completo: Today, Betty White is an icon, a comedienne and an actress with an 80-year career.
And 60 years ago this week, she came to Lancaster County to make her theater debut.
White starred in “Third Best Sport” at what is now Ephrata Performing Arts Center.
A memento from that one-week run still hangs at the theater. The framed photograph of White has a handwritten message: “To my Ephrata friends: You were my first time ‘on stage,’ and aren’t we both thrilled to see how we can grow? So many congratulations, Love, Betty White.’”
------------
‘Third Best Sport’
In 1959, White was a radio and television star. In “Life with Elizabeth,” one of television’s first 30-minute sitcoms, she was half a newly-married couple. In “The Betty White Show,” she interviewed guests and sang with the orchestra. She also was a regular on Jack Paar’s late night show when she came to Ephrata to star in “Third Best Sport.”
The play centers on newlyweds honeymooning in Florida. Unbeknownst to new bride Helen Sayre, her husband booked the honeymoon during a business convention.
“Instead of swimming in the surf, lazing in the sun and wooing in the chamber,” writes New York Times theater critic John Chapman, “She finds herself caught up in a mess of big deals and little jealousies.”
What is America’s third best sport? Conventions, just after sex and baseball.
On Broadway, Helen Sayre was played by Celeste Holm. Holm starred in “Oklahoma!” and won an Oscar for “The Gentleman's Agreement.”
Theater critic Brooks Atkinson gives Holm credit for her slapstick humor yet he calls “Third Best Sport” popular theater, dismissing it as something designed simply for amusement.
------------
Straw hat circuit
Ephrata’s theater was part of Lancaster County’s “straw hat” circuit of summer stock theater.
The theater White performed in, the Ephrata Legion Star Playhouse, is described in LNP archives as “the cool, open-air Summer Theater in Ephrata Legion Park.” Stars who came for short-run productions usually stayed in the hotel next door, which is now the Eicher Arts Center along Cocalico Creek.
White’s smiling face dominated ads for the play (”Don’t miss Betty White” they say). The show ran daily through the week, with two shows on Saturday. Tickets cost $1.50, $2.50 and $3.
------------
Betty White in Ephrata
White arrived in Lancaster County just six days before opening night to begin rehearsals.
She went to New York City to appear on the Jack Paar show and returned to Ephrata in time for a reception at the Hamilton Club with producer-director Darrell Larsen.
White hadn’t slept for nearly 24 hours, the Intelligencer reported, yet she still managed to seem “fresh and radiant” in a strawberry print dress with grosgrain bows and simple pearl jewelry.
She appreciated Ephrata’s theater in the round setting stage.
“This is my first experience with this sort of thing,” she said. “And I love it. Arena staging, you know, is much like television. I would be much more frightened of proscenium theatre, because I’ve never played it.”
Asked about Jack Paar, “I think Jack is a great performer. To me, he has been nothing short of wonderful.”
A few days later, the Sunday News shared a photo of the actress at the Ephrata Legion Pool. “Between rehearsals Saturday, she dashed across the park for a ‘quick dip’ in the pool,’” the cutline reads.
Lancaster’s newspapers had mixed reviews for the play.
“Persons who like a subtle wallop about the ‘goings on’ behind the scenes of big business will find this play made to order,” writes Herbert Krone in the New Era. “It’s a suggested ‘must’ for those who like comedy without slapstick.”
The Intelligencer Journal wasn’t as impressed.
“By this time, audiences who have been laughing at and with television star Betty White as she battles valiantly against some monstrous ‘togetherness affecting her marital life in 'Third Best Sport,’ now onstage at Ephrata Legion Star Playhouse, know that the first two best sports are sex and baseball,” writes Joseph Kingston.
“Said audiences may or may not agree with Playwrights Eleanor and Leo Bayer that convention-going is the ‘Third Best Sport,’ and they may find some of the broad humor rather hollow, even painful, since the play spoofs the modern sociological phenomenon clinically dissected in William F. Whyte’s ‘The Organization Man.’”
While in town, White met locals at Watt & Shand before the Friday performance.
She also spoke to a New Era reporter for a story in the women’s pages and said she missed her pets Bandy the Pekingese; Danny the poodle and Stormy the St. Bernard, all of whom stayed in Los Angeles.
When she’s not doing summer stock, White juggles radio and TV work and makes time daily for figure skating, “daily target shoots when able” and “tries for 36 holes of golf.”
How does she do it all, reporter Ann Geracimos asked.
“I guess it’s just that I love doing things,” she says. “And especially that I love what I’m doing.”
Her co-stars at the playhouse said that White has “‘a complete lack of temperament;’ that her ‘enthusiasm to work and work and work is astonishing’ and that she has a ‘phenomenal ability to learn her lines within a matter of minutes.’”
No word if White went to a shooting range in Lancaster County. But during her week here, she took time to play golf at Lancaster Country Club. The New Era shared a photo of the actress teeing off with Mrs. Ralph W. Coho Jr.
After the final curtain call in Ephrata, White went onto Warren, Ohio, to play Anna in “The King and I.”
Later she became Sue Ann Nivens on the “Mary Tyler Moore Show,” Rose Nylund from St. Olaf on "The Golden Girls" and a guest star on many shows. (Did you spot her in “Toy Story 4”? She’s the voice of Bitey White, Bonnie’s tiger chew toy.)
And years later, she signed a photo and sent it to the theater where she got her first chance on stage.

Biden walks back vow to let people keep private insurance

Texto completo: 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden backed away from an earlier campaign trail comment that suggested Americans would be able to keep their private insurance under his healthcare plan.
The New York Times editorial board asked the former vice president and 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner about his sentiment that "if you like your private insurance, you can keep your private insurance." The comment was similar to what President Barack Obama said in 2013 about his landmark Obamacare law — "If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it" — which PolitiFact dubbed the "lie of the year" after millions of Americans had their plans canceled.
"I didn’t say that, by the way, but go ahead," Biden said in the interview published Friday, before clarifying, "OK. Yeah, said we can keep your private insurance. Yep."
The question referred to a statement Biden made while outlining his healthcare plan at a July 2019 AARP forum in Iowa. “If you like your healthcare plan, your employer-based plan, you can keep it. If, in fact, you have private insurance, you can keep it,” he said.
In the interview published Friday, Biden added, "The doctors. They said you can keep your doctor."
Biden in July declined to promise that Americans could keep their doctors under his healthcare proposal.
The New York Times and Biden clarified that under his healthcare plan, if employers eliminate coverage options, they will automatically be enrolled in a public option.
"Here’s the deal. If you like your private insurance and your employer keeps it with you, you can keep it," Biden said.
Biden has proposed a healthcare plan that would allow Americans to choose a government insurance plan similar to Medicare instead of private health insurance. It is a contrast from "Medicare for all" single-payer health plan proposals supported by Biden's 2020 rivals Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.

Troops will stay in Iraq as Pentagon decides where to station US forces globally, official says

Texto completo: The United States has no plans to withdraw troops from Iraq and will assess the postings of American forces worldwide, Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said yesterday.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper has ordered “a zero-based review” of the disposition of U.S. forces worldwide, Hoffman told reporters on Thursday.
“We've been going through this for many months now,” Hoffman said. “He's sitting down with each of the combatant commands to walk through what is the right force posture; what are our right goals; what are the right countries we need to be engaging; what are the right challenges; and where can our allies and partners participate more?”
The U.S. remains in discussion with Iraq about the status of the roughly 5,000 American forces there, following reports that the country’s caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said the next government will decide whether to enforce a nonbinding vote in parliament to disinvite the U.S. troops.
“We're still in conversations with our Iraqi host,” Hoffman said. “We continue to want to be a friend and partner to the sovereign and prosperous Iraq. At this time, there are no plans by the U.S. military to withdraw from Iraq.”
Despite the vote in Iraq’s parliament, the Pentagon believes the consensus in Iraq is that the U.S. presence there is a force for good, Hoffman said. “Having the United States forces in Iraq allows NATO to be present, as well, to help with that counter-ISIS mission as well as the training mission, to support Iraqi Security Forces.”
During the Pentagon briefing, Hoffman confirmed that Esper has ordered “a zero-based review” of the disposition of U.S. forces worldwide.
Several senators, meanwhile, alarmed by reports that Esper might dramatically reduce the U.S. footprint in Africa, are pressing the Pentagon to put any such plans on hold.
The New York Times reported just before Christmas that Esper wants to reduce U.S. missions battling distant terrorist groups in order to refocus on confronting “Great Powers” such as Russia and China.
“We write to express our serious concern regarding reports of a possible decision to significantly reduce or completely withdraw U.S. Armed Forces within the United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) area of responsibility, specifically the Sahel of West Africa,” said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware in a letter to Esper yesterday.
“While we support the intent of the 2018 National Defense Strategy and the desire to do more to focus on our near-peer competitors, we must not forget the continued threat from violent extremists to our interests and our homeland,” they wrote.

So what if the new investigation of James Comey is politically motivated?

Texto completo: The report this week that former FBI Director James Comey is once again under investigation for possibly leaking yet more confidential material to the media should serve as a good reminder that only Democrats are allowed to investigate their political opponents.
When Republicans do it, the rules say, it’s an abuse of political power. And sorry, I don’t make the rules.
No, there are no such rules, but this really is what Democrats and the national media seem to believe.
The New York Times on Thursday broke the news that federal prosecutors are taking a look back at news reports from 2017, which contained details about a government email obtained by the Russians during their 2016 hacking campaign.
Both the Times and the Washington Post published information about the email, including how Comey came to know of it and his thoughts about it. If Comey was the one feeding the media information about it, this would be yet one more instance of him leaking secrets that he shouldn’t have been leaking.
In its report on Thursday, the Times said that the “timing” of the probe potentially implicating Comey “could raise questions about whether it was motivated at least in part by politics.” Uh, okay. And what difference would that make, exactly?
It’s not as though we haven’t just been through three years of politically motivated investigations demanded by Democrats.
Do you remember President Trump’s tax returns? He was elected despite never releasing them, and in office, his continued failure to do so hasn’t made any difference. The hunt for the returns is purely political.
Do you remember the Russia-collusion hoax? Why did a group of FBI agents fabricate a bunch of reasons to spy on Trump’s 2016 campaign? That was political, and we only know that because Attorney General William Barr called for an investigation into that matter. (Recall that Democrats had the temerity to call Barr’s probe political.)
Somehow, Democrats avoid media skepticism over their political investigations. So if the latest investigation of past leaks is political, even in part, then deal with it.

Biden chides New York Times for coverage of older candidates: 'I bike, treadmill, and I lift'

Texto completo: Joe Biden playfully accused the New York Times of pedaling ageism when its editorial board pressed him on whether there was a need for an upper age limit on the presidency.
"I think you guys are engaging in ageism here," Biden, 77, told the outlet. "Now, look: All kidding aside, I don’t think they’re — the voters — will be able to make a judgment. You’ll make a judgment whether or not you think I have all my cognitive capability, I’m physically capable, and I have the energy to do the job."
But the former vice president repeated that it was "legitimate" for Democrats weighing their options for the 2020 presidential nomination to consider his age, saying they had to take it into account when he was 29 running in his first race to represent Delaware in the Senate.
The New York Times's Binyamin Appelbaum had invoked President Ronald Reagan as one example to support the argument for an upper age limit on seeking the White House.
During an 80-minute conversation with the board, Biden also boasted about his vitality, described his exercise regime, and offered to demonstrate his ability to do 44 pushups.
"I do three things. I bike, treadmill, and I lift," he said.
Although his recent release of some medical records promoted a relatively clean bill of health, Biden's age has frequently been called into question during the primary, particularly after he's misspoken or rambled on the campaign trail. If elected, he would be the oldest president to take office. Reagan, the current record-holder for the oldest president, was 77 when he left office in 1989.

'Take your letter and shove it': Ted Lieu fires back scathing letter in response to Nunes threat

Texto completo: Rep. Ted Lieu told Rep. Devin Nunes’s lawyer to “shove it” after he was threatened with a lawsuit.
The California Democrat previously said Nunes, a California Republican, sent him a letter threatening litigation if he did not apologize for accusing Nunes last month of conspiring with Lev Parnas as part of the Ukraine scandal.
On Friday, Lieu shared one page of what he said was the five-page letter threatening a lawsuit, along with his response to Nunes’s lawyer, Steven Biss. The letter from Biss is dated Dec. 31, and Lieu’s response is dated Jan. 16.
In the response, Lieu said that Nunes is “directly implicated” and that “truth is a defense.”
“I welcome any lawsuit from your client and look forward to taking discovery of Congressman Nunes,” he said. “Or, you can take your letter and shove it.”
Tweet
Nunes recently admitted that he now remembers a phone call with Parnas, who has been indicted on campaign finance charges and worked with President Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
"I remember that call, which was very odd, random, talking about random things," Nunes said Wednesday.

Akin to ensuring that telecommunications companies aren’t held responsible for the content of phone conversations, Section 230 is a commonsense policy that allows for free discourse on the internet, subject to standards imposed by individual online platforms. Ironically, Biden’s stance echoes conservative politicians such as Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, who have also called for Section 230’s repeal. In their case, the two Republicans are looking to punish companies such as Facebook for what they perceive as censorship of conservatives.
While liberal critics such as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi describe the law as a “gift” to Big Tech companies, the opposite is true. Repealing Section 230 would also affect smaller platforms and independent websites, especially those allowing comments on articles. Unlike Facebook or Google, these companies typically don’t have the necessary resources to moderate or fact-check everything their users post.
Additionally, unlike the social media giants, most smaller companies don’t have the legal resources to withstand costly, protracted litigation that could drive them bankrupt even if they’re legally in the right. It’s strange, then, for critics to complain about the disproportionate influence that platforms such as Facebook have on public discourse while simultaneously advocating a legislative change that will further entrench their monopoly.
Stricter content moderation requirements and less competition among platforms would also severely hurt users and consumers.
Companies, especially startups lacking brand recognition, are already at the mercy of a saturated digital advertising market dominated by Google, Amazon, and Facebook. If platforms are forced to further crack down on the advertisements they allow, they’ll end up favoring well-established players who already hold large market shares while heavily scrutinizing lesser-known rivals or upstarts.
Under the status quo, companies and users are already legally liable for posts and claims they make on these platforms. Repealing Section 230 would inadvertently punish small businesses reliant on digital services.
Similarly, rather than reducing the fake news politicians such as Biden claim to be targeting, repealing Section 230 would likely result in a less-informed public with fewer spaces to engage in free public debate, only making the problem worse.
Regardless of how harshly politicians may want to police social media, the responsibility for discerning facts from fiction ultimately lies with readers, who are exposed to more information from a variety of sources in the digital age than ever before. Biden’s plan to crack down on social media platforms only insults our collective intelligence and plays into the very hands of the dominant tech giants he decries.

Texto completo: Joe Biden claimed to be politically infallible in the face of attacks lobbed at him by rivals to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.
"I’m not saying that it’s guaranteed I win, but name me a nominee who’s taken as many hits from the beginning of them announcing. ... Who has taken the hits? You all declare me — not you, editorially in a broad sense declare me — dead, and guess what? I ain’t dead. I’m not going to die," the former vice president told the New York Times's editorial board.
The quip from Biden, 77, earned a pithy response from the outlet's Kathleen Kingsbury.
"Everybody dies," Kingsbury said.
"I’m not going to die politically," he replied.
Sen. Kamala Harris from California experienced a brief surge in polling and fundraising after confronting Biden during the opening primary debate in Miami last summer over his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1960s and 1970s. She blunted her momentum by confusing her own position on the issue before voters starting criticizing the move as being too practiced and inauthentic.
Then, during the September debate in Houston, former Housing Secretary Julian Castro's line about Biden forgetting what he said earlier in the night generated mixed reviews for insinuating the 36-year Delaware senator was growing senile.
Harris dropped out of the Democratic race for the White House last December. Castro ended his own bid this month before endorsing former opponent Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
"Everybody who’s hit me is out," Biden told the New York Times in the interview released Friday.

Texto completo: This is a golden age for “Theyism.” This is the belief that there is some malevolent, elite “they” out there and “they” are destroying life for the rest of us.
There is Donald Trump’s culture-war Theyism: The coastal cultural elites hate genuine Americans, undermining our values and opening our borders. And there is Bernie Sanders’ class-war Theyism: The billionaires have rigged the economy to benefit themselves and impoverish everyone else.
Each of these stories takes a genuine tension in society and blows it up into an all-explaining cartoon in which one part of America is trying to destroy the other part.
The Republican Party has been swallowed by Trump’s culture war, and many Democrats seem to be rushing to join Sanders’ class war.
These Democrats are doing this even though it is political suicide. Class-war progressivism always loses to culture-war conservatism because swing voters in the Midwest care more about their values — guns, patriotism, ending abortion, masculinity, whatever — than they do about proletarian class consciousness.
Democrats are doing this even though the Sanders class-war story is wrong.
Sanders starts with a truth: Workers need more bargaining power as they negotiate wages with their employers. But then he blows this up into an all-explaining ideology: Capitalism is a system of exploitation in which capitalist power completely dominates worker power. This ideology crashes against the facts.
In the first place, over the past few years wages for workers toward the bottom of the income stream have been rising faster than wages for those toward the top. If the bosses have the workers by the throat, how can this be happening?
Second, wages are still generally determined by skills and productivity. For example, Edward Lazear of Stanford University finds that between 1989 and 2017, productivity in mostly high-skill industries rose by roughly 34% and wages in those industries rose by 26%. Productivity in industries with mostly less-skilled workers rose by 20% while wages grew by 24%.
As Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, capitalism is doing what it’s supposed to do. It is rewarding productivity with pay, and some people and companies are more productive. If you improve worker bargaining power, that may help a bit, but over the long run people can’t earn what they don’t produce.
Third, and most important, most of the increase in earnings inequality has happened between companies, not within them. As John Van Reenen of MIT has found, all over the world superstar businesses are racing ahead of their competitors. As those companies grow more productive, they earn more profit per employee and pay their workers more. Companies that can’t match that productivity don’t, and their workers lag behind.
A recent Brookings Institution/Chumir Foundation report also notes that there is a growing productivity gap between superstar companies and everybody else. Whether it is in tech, retail, manufacturing, utilities or services, productivity growth at the leading companies in each industry has remained very strong. Those productive businesses are capturing larger and larger market shares. But productivity is not growing fast among the lagging companies. Workers in those businesses suffer.
Today’s successful bosses are doing what they should be doing: increasing productivity, growing their businesses and offering great service. A side effect of their efficiency is they spend a smaller share of their revenue on labor even while raising their workers’ wages. In a global information-age economy, the rewards for being best are huge.
Thus, the core problem is not capitalists exploiting their workers; it’s the rise of productivity inequality. It’s the companies and individuals who don’t have the skills to take advantage of new technologies.
The real solution, therefore, is not class war to hammer successful businesses. It’s to boost and expand productivity for everybody else. That’s done the old-fashioned way — by having better schools and better vocational training, by having more open competitive markets, by creating incentives to expand investment, by making sure superstar businesses don’t use lobbyists to lock in their advantages.
I understand if you want to stick to an us-versus-them political ideology. It’s emotionally satisfying to base your political ideology on blaming people you dislike. In fact, I strongly recommend Michael Lind’s new book, “The New Class War,” which is the best version of us/them.
Lind makes a lot of vague generalizations about the “managerial elite,” which he blames for our problems. But at least he’s interesting and provocative. At least he understands that a politically plausible “Theyism” is economically left and socially right — combining the culture war and class war into a tidy narrative.
But if you want to deal with our real problems, stop the us/them warfare and start dealing with productivity inequality.
Successful executives are doing what’s best for their companies, gathering as much talent as they can. This isn’t evil. It’s not exploitation.
The job of public policy is to make it easier for everybody to do what successful people are doing. Productivity is the key to national prosperity. Every time we increase productivity for one person, we all thrive a little more, together.

Timothy Egan: Trump’s evil is contageous

Texto completo: It passed with the usual shrug by the usual handmaidens of hatred when the president of the world’s most powerful democracy threatened to commit war crimes by bombing Iranian cultural sites — the kind of barbarism practiced by the Taliban and rogue-state thugs.
After being told that he would be in violation of Geneva Convention rules that the United States had helped to create back when America was actually great, President Donald Trump relented, but still wondered: Why not?
The warlord-in-chief had already gone out of his way to protect a Navy SEAL member who’d been accused of committing war crimes. And what kind of man did the president upend the military code of justice for?
“The guy is freaking evil,” one fellow SEAL told investigators, referring to Special Operations chief Edward Gallagher, who was convicted of posing with the corpse of a teenage boy who’d been killed in his custody. After the presidential intervention, the formerly shamed serviceman was posing at Mar-a-Lago.
On any given day, Trump is vindictive, ignorant, narcissistic, a fraud — well, his pathologies are well known. But it’s time to apply the same word to him as the brave Navy man did to the renegade in his unit. Under Trump, the United States is a confederacy of corruption, driven by a thousand points of evil. And that evil is contagious.
We all grew up hearing an ageless warning about public morality: that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing.
The presumed outcome is reassuring, a story we tell ourselves. But in the last three years, that homily has been proven right, in the country where it was not supposed to happen. The Trump presidency has shown just how many ostensibly good people will do nothing, and how evil, when given a free rein at the top, trickles down.
When Trump retweeted a Photoshopped image of the two most important Democratic leaders of Congress dressed in Islamic garb in front of the Iranian flag, there was no chorus of condemnation from his side. Here was a graphic lie, a cheap defamation, the kind of dirty little trick that politicians usually give to the felon operating under the radar. For Trump, it was just another Monday.
Was it politics, or evil, when candidate Trump smeared a Gold Star family in 2016? Was it a mere shift in public policy, or evil, when Trump allowed people acting in our name to put children in cages and separate them from their mothers?
Was it mere theatrics to revel in a chant of “Lock her up,” about Hillary Clinton, who has now been exonerated, twice, by federal investigators? Was it normal for the 44th successor of a president who could not tell a lie, to lie more than 15,000 times?
Trump has so desensitized us that a day without a round of blunt force cruelty from the White House is newsworthy. And now it all comes to a boil in the impeachment trial. The facts are not in dispute: Trump tried to force a struggling democracy into doing his political dirty work for him. He tried to squeeze a foreign power into meddling in our election. What is very much in doubt is whether enough good people will do something.
In the process of this high crime, Trump broke the law, as a nonpartisan congressional watchdog reported Thursday. The greater evil is the violation of the lofty purpose written into this country’s founding documents. The smaller evils are the Republican senators who know the president violated his oath and deserves to be impeached, but don’t have the guts to say so.
“Do not, as my party did, underestimate the evil, desperate nature of evil, desperate people,” writes Rick Wilson, the Republican operative and witty Never-Trumper, in “Running Against the Devil,” his new book. “There is no bottom. There is no shame. There are no limits.”
As for the contagion of evil, you need not look far. In Texas this month, Gov. Greg Abbott said his state would become the first to refuse to take in even a small number of legal, fully vetted refugees. These are people who’ve been approved by the federal government for asylum, after being displaced by war, famine or persecution. In the past, people from Vietnam, Cuba and Africa have been welcomed, and have gone on to become some of our finest citizens.
A handful of citizens, the Catholic Church, some members of Congress, objected. “Accepting refugees with open arms — giving without keeping score — is who we are as Americans,” tweeted Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., herself an immigrant.
Sorry, that’s not who we are as Americans in the Trump era. When the hate flag is flying, most of Trump’s followers have stood up and saluted.
Here’s the two-step that all good people must take now: First, realize the level of depravity that has taken over the White House, and second, fight accordingly.
“Do not come to this fight believing that the Trump team views any action, including outright criminality, as off limits,” writes Wilson. This doesn’t mean you have to cheat, lie, or coerce. But it means you do have to fight, or be counted among the do-nothings who allowed evil to flourish.

Charles M. Blow: To beat Trump, put ideals before ideas

Texto completo: Democrats face a real dilemma: The current crop of their party’s presidential candidates are awash in plans and proposals, which in theory is a good thing, but this election will not be decided on that basis.
Donald Trump has transformed the electorate into two camps, sycophants and dissidents, both passionate, both aimed like missiles at November, both with an intent desire to destroy the competition.
This election won’t turn on the definition of “Medicare for All” or its funding mechanisms. It won’t turn on who offers free college and to whom. This election will turn on whether an individual voter sees Trump as a heroic savior or a destructive agent.
This election is about fundamental questions of American ideals: Should foreign countries be invited or welcomed to meddle in our elections? Should a president be allowed to openly obstruct justice without consequence? Should we separate immigrant children from their parents and lock them in cages? Should we have a president who has bragged about assaulting women, paid off women who claim to have been sexually involved with him and been accused by multiple women of being sexually inappropriate with them? Should America have a racist in the White House?
It is issues like these, I believe, that will most animate voters in the election. America is being forced to look itself in the mirror and figure out who it is.
And it seems to me that many of the Democratic candidates are missing that base-level moral conflict, aiming over it or wiggling around it.
The moderate candidates pitch a path to victory to win back white people in the Midwest by being just milquetoast enough not to offend them and to cause them no guilt or consternation about having supported a racist, sexist transphobe who lies about everything and honors nothing.
The progressives promise us a future with wholesale transformation in every sector: the economy, the military, the health care industry and education. They see a generational opportunity, indeed an existential emergency, to not only alter America’s course, but in some cases to tear down sectors and rebuild them altogether.
But their approaches, I fear, stray too far afield from where most Americans are. Voters simply want to get rid of Trump or to keep him. Liberal voters are not interested in candidates who kowtow to the white nationalists in the Rust Belt who not only voted for Trump but still cheer for him. Whenever I hear candidates talking about their natural appeal to these voters, my spidey senses are activated.
These are those who cheer for a man who saw “very fine people on both sides” in Charlottesville, Virginia. These are people who see no problem with the separation of migrant families. These are people who abide by the president employing white nationalists in his administration.
I am quite frankly suspicious of the candidate who actively appeals to these people. Their continued support for Trump isn’t just some small mistake they made, like picking up a zucchini instead of a cucumber at the market.
No, their Trump support is a value statement, one that turns on the denial of other people’s rights to freedom, equality and safe existence.
How can a person appeal to me and to that person simultaneously and do so with integrity and honor?
At the same time, transformational change sounds good and smart in theory, but it simply isn’t most Trump-resisting Americans’ most urgent concern. Removing Trump is. Furthermore, the federal government is notoriously inefficient and problem-prone. It would most likely take it decades to carry out a single large-scale change and tweak it until it worked properly. It is impossible for me to believe that any candidate could manage major change in multiple areas at the same time.
This is not to say that the proposals of the progressive candidates don’t have merit. They do. Their goals are the right ones for the Democratic Party and the planet. But this election will not likely be the proving ground for these proposals.
In this cycle, it is hard to sell reorganizing the whole country to people who are simply afraid that Trump is going to destroy the whole country.
That is a reason that Tuesday night’s debate got a bit too far down into the weeds for me. Indeed, although the ability of candidates to make sustained arguments has improved and the number of people allowed on the stage has shrunk, there remains a sort of nerdy gladiator feel to them that numbs with numbers.
Trump has laid out his vision for America: It is the racial Hunger Games. It is a dystopian future in which maximum pressure is applied to minority immigrants and trading partners, all to insulate the white working class. Trump is the white nationalist candidate selling the racial romance of reverting America to a time when white workers were virtually guaranteed success and prosperity, often at the expense and exclusion of others.
The Democratic candidates, too, would be well warned to stick to a vision — a diametrically opposite and dynamically animating vision that will activate and energize the targets of Trump’s aggressions.
If I see Trump as a pestilence I may not see in your tome of plans a cure.

Texto completo: The Philadelphia Inquirer
It was a busy 24 hours for Lev Parnas, an otherwise obscure Ukraine-born businessman who is suddenly at the center of President Donald Trump’s impeachment.
Parnas sat down for high-profile interviews on Wednesday with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and CNN host Anderson Cooper. During those interviews, which aired on Wednesday night and continued Thursday, Parnas said the president knew about a Ukrainian scheme headed by Rudy Giuliani to obtain dirt on potential 2020 political rival Joe Biden.
Here’s everything we know about Parnas, highlights of what he told Maddow and Cooper, and how it might impact Trump’s upcoming Senate impeachment trial.
Q: Who is Lev Parnas?
A: Parnas is a businessman who was born in Odessa, Ukraine, in 1972 when it was part of the Soviet Union. Parnas emigrated to the United States with his family when he was 3 years old and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He reportedly played a key role aiding Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal attorney and the former mayor of New York City, in a scheme to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who sat on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.
Prior to his work with Giuliani, Parnas was a businessman in Florida. The Miami Herald reported that he “left a long trail of debts in Florida and beyond.” He is currently under indictment, and has pleaded not guilty to largely unrelated campaign finance charges that he funneled money from foreign entities to U.S. political candidates. Parnas also is accused of hiding assets, including $1 million from a Russian oligarch with ties to the president’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.
Q: What was Parnas’ role in Ukraine?
A: Parnas and his partner, Igor Furman (who is also under indictment), reportedly helped set up meetings for Giuliani with Ukrainian officials in an attempt to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on 2016 election interference and to dig up dirt on Biden, the Democratic front-runner to challenge Trump’s reelection in 2020.
Claiming he worked under Guiliani’s direction, Parnas said his goal was to convince Ukraine to announce an investigation into Biden, and claimed part of the pressure campaign was the threat to cut off all aid to Ukraine — not just the security aid authorized by Congress.
Giuliani told the New York Times on Wednesday night that Parnas is “a proven liar,” but didn’t not specifically dispute any of Parnas’ allegations.
Q: What did Parnas tell Rachel Maddow and Anderson Cooper?
A: Though Parnas said he never spoke with Trump directly, he told Maddow that he “wouldn’t do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president.” He also said the only reason he gained access to political leaders in Ukraine was because he was working on behalf of Giuliani and Trump.
Parnas claimed that Vice President Mike Pence was also involved in the scheme, telling Maddow a planned trip Kyiv for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenksy’s inauguration was canceled because of their refusal to publicly announce an investigation into Biden.
Marc Short, the chief of staff for Pence’s office, didn’t deny Parnas’ allegations in a statement to the New York Times. Instead, Short said Parnas “will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison.”
During his CNN interview, which aired in its entirety Thursday night, Parnas disputed Trump’s claim that his goal in Ukraine was to simply fight corruption, telling Cooper it was “all about 2020” and hurting a potential political rival in Biden.
Q: How does Lev Parnas fit into President Trump’s impeachment trial?
A: Parnas said he would be willing to testify in the upcoming Senate trial, and told Cooper he and former National Security Adviser John Bolton “could fill in all the dots.” Bolton also has said he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate, but it remains unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will allow any witnesses to testify during the trial, which is expected to begin next week.
Parnas also provided a trove of documents, including text messages and letters, that were made public by the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. The documents appear to bolster his claims that he worked as part of Giuliani’s efforts in Ukraine.
Ukraine announced Thursday it has opened an investigation into the possible illegal surveillance of former U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, which was suggested in the documents Parnas provided to Congress.

Collins: Some wins for the women

Texto completo: We’ve spent a remarkable amount of time this week discussing whether there’s sexism in politics.
Hahahahaha
OK, no need to be cynical. Let’s look on the positive side first. If you are around Elizabeth Warren’s age of 70, you’ve had the incredible luck to live through a period of history in which American women’s rights and opportunities have been transformed. There are still people alive who were born when women couldn’t vote. Now we’ve got Nancy Pelosi giving a herd of male leaders their marching orders in Congress.
This doesn’t mean all the battles are won. We’ve got only nine female governors, and a lot of people of both sexes really don’t believe the country will elect any female president.
How you look at this depends a lot on why you think Hillary Clinton lost. Yes, she did get 2.8 million more votes than Donald Trump. But we can’t spend the day bewailing the existence of the Electoral College.
Back to the question. Why do you think she lost?
“Sexism.”
“Failure to campaign in Wisconsin.”
“She won! She won! She won! She ——”
Sorry about that sharp elbow, but I told you we weren’t going there. Next you’re going to be moaning about Al Gore.
“Al Gore won!”
That’s it. Unless you have a special interest in the election of Benjamin Harrison.
“Grover Cleveland was robbed!”
You understand we need to move on here, right? Personally, I’ve always suspected that Clinton lost — to the degree that she lost — not so much because of her gender as because people just wanted a change. She’d been a starring player in two eight-year administrations. It was pretty clear what we were going to get in another Clinton presidency, and it wasn’t going to be anything dramatically new.
(This is what happens when you get a little bit bored with life and decide you want to juice things up. You spend $50,000 on a new sports car and then drive it into a restaurant takeout window. Or far worse, you elect Donald Trump.)
The whole can-a-woman-be-president issue came up during this week’s debate. Warren had one of her best moments when she pointed out that the male candidates with whom she shared the stage had collectively lost 10 elections, while the women hadn’t lost a single one.
And besides, she added, she was the only person onstage who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years. Bernie Sanders — who contributed seven of those losses — quickly volunteered that he had beaten a Republican incumbent in 1990. Which Warren, despite her career as a primary-school teacher, claimed was not within the past 30 years.
Joe Biden didn’t point out that he beat a Republican incumbent to win his Senate seat in 1972. This is worth mentioning since some people worry that one of the Democrats’ leading candidates seems to kind of be living in the past.
About Joe Biden. This is his third run for president. Who among us could forget 2008, when he came in fifth in Iowa and dropped out? Or 1988, when he — OK, you did forget 1988. Totally understand.
Biden hasn’t had any super disasters in the debates. Well, there was the time in October when he said: “I would eliminate the capital gains tax — I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5%.” And that time in November when he spoke out against violence against women, adding that “we have to just change the culture ... and keep punching at it and punching at it.” Details, details.
This last performance was pretty clean and Biden got fairly good reviews, many of which boiled down to how he’d gotten through the evening “without taking major damage.”
Can we all agree that no female candidate could ever get away with stuff like that and then win praise for not saying anything stranger?
When it comes to gender bias, in the past Biden agreed that Clinton faced it to an “unfair” degree. Then he added, “That’s not going to happen with me.”
His campaign later claimed that his statement did not, um, mean what it sort of sounded like it meant.
So, about sexism in politics. Absolutely there, especially at the highest levels. But dissolving rapidly in places where women are proving what terrific vote-getters they are. We have 26 women in the Senate now — nearly half the all-of-American-history total. Seventeen are Democrats.
This little detail gives us an opportunity to recall the days when the Republican Party was progressive enough to have serious arguments about whether a woman could win the presidency. Remember the glorious Sen. Margaret Chase Smith? She ran for the nomination in 1964, when she was 66. A columnist for the Los Angeles Times argued that she was too old and added that when women hit the ideal age for running in their late 40s or early 50s, they are utterly unfit for office, since they are undergoing the “physical changes and emotional distress” of menopause.
So you have to admit things have been getting better. For women, that is. We’ve still got Donald Trump. Sorry, nation.

La empresa dijo que, si alguno de los equipos llegaba a este puntaje, reembolsará el precio de esta bebida que puede costar hasta $2.50 dólares . Para tener este dinero de vuelta, deberás haber comprado la Pepsi Zero Sugar del 2 al 4 de febrero.
Como dato curioso, tan solo en el 25% de los juegos que se han hecho del Super Bowl han terminado con uno de los equipos con un puntaje que finalizó en cero.

Esta promoción forma parte de una campaña para presentar el nuevo diseño de la bebida. “ Vamos con todo con Pepsi Zero Sugar este año , y hemos creado un nuevo aspecto audaz y sin complejos para que coincida con su gran sabor, con una nueva lata negra mate y una lengüeta negra que se destacará en cualquier lugar”, dijo Todd Kaplan, vicepresidente de marketing de Pepsi.
Jennifer Lopez y Shakira serán las encargadas del espectáculo de medio tiempo en el partido que se celebrará este 2 de febrero en el Hard Rock Stadium en Miami Gardens, Florida, de acuerdo con el portal New York Times Post.
Hasta el momento, a Pepsi le está yendo bien, pues sus acciones han subido un 1.9% en lo que va del año. Además, recientemente lanzó un nuevo producto llamado PepsiCafe, que tiene una combinación de café y cola.
Este nuevo producto fue una alternativa que la empresa ofrece, ya que se ha detectado que el consumo de refrescos en los Estados Unidos está disminuyendo año con año.

Esta promoción forma parte de una campaña para presentar el nuevo diseño de la bebida. “ Vamos con todo con Pepsi Zero Sugar este año , y hemos creado un nuevo aspecto audaz y sin complejos para que coincida con su gran sabor, con una nueva lata negra mate y una lengüeta negra que se destacará en cualquier lugar”, dijo Todd Kaplan, vicepresidente de marketing de Pepsi.
Jennifer Lopez y Shakira serán las encargadas del espectáculo de medio tiempo en el partido que se celebrará este 2 de febrero en el Hard Rock Stadium en Miami Gardens, Florida, de acuerdo con el portal New York Times Post.
Hasta el momento, a Pepsi le está yendo bien, pues sus acciones han subido un 1.9% en lo que va del año. Además, recientemente lanzó un nuevo producto llamado PepsiCafe, que tiene una combinación de café y cola.
Este nuevo producto fue una alternativa que la empresa ofrece, ya que se ha detectado que el consumo de refrescos en los Estados Unidos está disminuyendo año con año.

Minnesotan will head U.S. Embassy in Kabul

Texto completo: The Trump administration has tapped a Minnesota native to lead the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan at a critical time as the U.S. negotiates a peace agreement.
Ross Wilson, who spent nearly four decades in the U.S. Foreign Service before retiring near the Twin Cities, accepted U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's request this month to lead the U.S. Embassy in Kabul until the Senate confirms a permanent ambassador.
"Afghanistan is an extraordinarily challenging, but also very consequential, assignment and I am honored by the trust and confidence that Secretary of State Pompeo and the Department of State have placed in me," Wilson said in a statement he issued from Washington, D.C., before heading overseas.
It's the third time the veteran diplomat has been called out of retirement to help lead U.S. embassies -- most recently, in 2018, when the Trump administration asked Wilson to fill in as the charg d'affaires in the Asian nation of Georgia. Now, Wilson, who was sworn back into the U.S. Foreign Service last week, replaces John Bass, who spent two years as ambassador in the Afghan capital until Jan. 6.
A State Department spokesperson said in a statement that Wilson will arrive in Kabul soon, taking over "one of the world's most chal
lenging diplomatic postings."
"Ambassador Wilson's policy and leadership expertise will ensure we continue to advance U.S. interests in Afghanistan, including moving forward with the Afghan peace process and supporting women, civil society, democratic governance, and rule of law as Afghans define how they will govern themselves," the statement said.
A State Department official told the New York Times that Bass wasn't being removed from the role because of any disagreement with the administration and that it's typical for ambassadors to serve only two years because of the high-stress nature of the job.
"This is not just any post; it's Afghanistan -- our longest war," added Tom Hanson, chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations Minnesota and a diplomat-in-residence at the Alworth Institute for International Studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth.
"This is a very important position that he's going into … [a] sensitive and high-level position. … I think if anybody's up to it, it's Ross."
The turnover comes at a critical time. Just this week, two U.S. service members in Afghanistan were killed when their vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb, an attack the Taliban took responsibility for.
In November, Trump announced the U.S. had reopened peace talks with the Taliban, which could lead to withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from the nation. During the 18-year war, more than 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed.
The U.S. has about 13,000 troops in Afghanistan now.
There are also escalating tensions with the U.S. and Iran after the U.S. killed Iran's top general, Qassem Soleimani.
While a special envoy leads peace negotiations with the Taliban, Wilson still will oversee the large embassy and manage the United States' direct relationship with the Afghan government, such as the terms of assistance programs. Mary Curtin, who spent 25 years in the U.S. Foreign Service and is diplomat-in-residence at the Humphrey School of Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota, said there are often gaps in ambassador roles that the No. 2 leader takes on. But the fact the U.S. tapped Wilson as the charg d'affaires demonstrates how important Afghanistan is to the United States.
"It sends a message to the host government that this is really important and we're sending in somebody of senior stature," Curtin said. "And it sends a message to the team there that Washington is paying attention and it provides leadership at a high level."
Wilson, 64, graduated from the University of Minnesota and lives near the Twin Cities with his wife, Margo Squire, also a retired diplomat. Wilson has had assignments at U.S. embassies in Moscow and Prague and at the consulate general in Melbourne. He served as ambassador to Azerbaijan from 2000 to 2003 and as ambassador to Turkey from 2005 to 2008 under President George W. Bush. In 2014, he served as the charg d'affaires in Turkey before the temporary role in Georgia in 2018.
Wilson was most recently a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., and volunteered on the board of Minneapolis nonprofit Global Minnesota.
Mark Ritchie, a former Minnesota secretary of state who heads the nonprofit, said Wilson "is exactly who you want in a senior diplomatic post," and his assignment should draw Minnesotans' attention to a region that doesn't always get local notice.
"We have a very long history of Minnesotans being distinguished in foreign careers," Ritchie said, "and in all matters related to international affairs."

The Comey Coverup Unravels; The FBI, the CIA and the press all have much to be embarrassed about.

Texto completo: In a curious report on Thursday evening, the New York Times carefully averts its eyes from everything that's interesting. Even Adam Schiff has acknowledged that James Comey's actions in 2016 may represent the most important and significant Russian influence on the election. (Hoist your shot glass. This will be the umpteenth time I've quoted Mr. Schiff on this matter in this column.)
Surely one of the most consequential pieces of intelligence ever received by U.S. agencies was, as we now learn, received in early 2016 from a Dutch counterpart. This is the dubious Russian intelligence that set off Mr. Comey's multiple interventions in the last presidential race, culminating in an improper act that may have inadvertently elected Donald Trump. Even at the time Mr. Comey's FBI colleagues considered the intelligence, which indicated questionable actions by the Justice Department to fix the Hillary email investigation, to be false, possibly a Russian plant.
The Times adds the unsurprising revelation that Mr. Comey himself is suspected in the illegal leak that, in early 2017, alerted the media to this untold aspect of his 2016 actions, before the matter disappeared again behind a veil of official secrecy. Yet bizarrely, the paper plays down its scoop, suggesting that any inquiry into a "years-old" leak now can only be a political hit job by an "ambitious" Justice Department attorney seeking to please President Trump.
First of all, I doubt this subject pleases Mr. Trump—it re-raises the question of whether his election was an accident caused by Mr. Comey. Second, the information is obviously important. The scandal hiding in plain sight is our intelligence establishment's misuse of its authority to muck around in the 2016 election.
As a bonus, I'm going to suggest the FBI's own pursuit of the collusion will-o'-the-wisp may have been occasioned by its hope of finding that the same fabricated Russian intelligence was in the hands of the Trump campaign, providing an ex post justification for Mr. Comey's actions that he desperately would have wanted once fingers began pointing at him for Mrs. Clinton's defeat. (I guess we can at least be glad he didn't plant the information on Carter Page.)
Let's call a spade a spade. The media is a big part of the coverup. When the Justice Department inspector general issued his damning report on Mr. Comey, not one media outlet in the Factiva database told its readers about the existence of its classified appendix except this column and Britain's Daily Mail tabloid.
Mr. Comey himself, after allegedly leaking the secret information to the press, penned a sententious memoir suggesting the same info should remain hidden from the American people "decades from now."
And while flogging fake revelations from the nonexistent Trump-Russia conspiracy, the mainstream press ignored a public plea, uttered before Congress, by the Justice Department's own inspector general that the secret Comey information be declassified so the people and their representatives can know the truth about 2016.
On Thursday night, former Rep. Trey Gowdy reported that the information Mr. Comey is suspected of leaking to the media he refused to share even with Congress in a classified briefing, saying it was too top secret.
The mainstream media has been uncharacteristically silent about all this for too long—and you're about to find out why. Whether from design or myopia, it allowed itself to be instrumental in suppressing real news in favor of a fairy tale about Mr. Trump and the Russians. That's the deeper message of the Times's weirdly conflicted handling of its scoop about Mr. Comey.
Leaking secret intelligence, if that's what Mr. Comey did, is a crime. But even more palpable is something else: The information remains officially classified not to protect national security but to protect the national-security establishment from embarrassment.
The story here truly contains something for everybody. If you think Mr. Trump never should have been president, blame Mr. Comey. If you think the "deep state" is running amok, here's your evidence. If you think the intelligence establishment is incompetent and needs a Trumpian kick in the derrière, even more so.
Alas, every revelation about this matter turns out to be a revelation also about the deviousness and expediency of Mr. Comey, the nation's former FBI director. What should happen now? More than ever, Attorney General William Barr should act on the authority Mr. Trump has given him and declassify the inspector general's report as well any material describing the role of other agencies (e.g., the CIA) in Mr. Comey's election-meddling escapades.

The Left Forgets What Martin Luther King Stood For; He didn't think oppression was what defined the struggle for civil rights.

Texto completo: As the nation celebrates the birth of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the progressive left will again seize the moment to twist the story of black Americans' struggle, to the detriment of those who suffered most in that struggle. They'll put all the attention on the oppressive conditions faced by black freedom fighters—what white racists did to them—rather than on their own spirit in fighting to gain equal rights under the law. Instead of celebrating blacks' achievements and the progress made toward delivering on America's promissory note, the left will transport yesterday's real injustices into today's false social-justice narrative, ignoring the principles that were so crucial to Dr. King.
History is full of inspiring examples of black people succeeding against the odds, including building their own schools, hotels, railroads and banking systems when doors were closed to them. According to the economist Thomas Sowell, "the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960."
These accomplishments were made possible by a set of values cherished among the blacks of the time: self-determination, resiliency, personal virtue, honesty, honor and accountability. Dr. King understood that these values would be the bedrock for black success once true equality was won. As early as 1953, he warned that "one of the most common tendencies of human nature is that of placing responsibility on some external agency for sins we have committed or mistakes we have made."
Today the progressive left wants to ignore the achievements and pretend that blacks are perpetual victims of white racism. The New York Times's "1619 Project" essay series is the latest salvo in this attack on America's history and founding, claiming "anti-black racism runs in the very DNA of this country." This statement is an abomination of everything Dr. King stood for. Further, the left's disinterest in historical accuracy—as evinced in the Times's dismissal of corrections sought by prominent historians—and its frequent perversion of blacks' story will have grave consequences not only for blacks but the nation as a whole.
In sharp contrast to the claims of the "1619 Project"—which disparages the American Revolution and Declaration of Independence and insists America is hopelessly racist—Dr. King believed deeply in the need to remain true to the Founders' vision, the "patriot dream that sees beyond the years." To him, that was the only avenue toward fulfilling America's promise. As he wrote in his 1963 "Letter From a Birmingham Jail":
"One day the South will know that when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judaeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
"We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over the nation," he wrote, "because the goal of America is freedom. Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny."
Dr. King, who sought full participation in America, would never have indulged today's grievance-based identity politics, whose social-justice warriors use race as a battering ram against the country. In fact, in "Letter From a Birmingham Jail" Dr. King explicitly warned against the type of groupthink that characterizes identity politics: "Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals."
Yesterday's values prepared blacks to walk through the doors of opportunity opened to them through civil rights. Family, faith, character and moral behavior were all crucial to their victories. Today's social-justice warriors trade on the currency of oppression, deriding the concept of personal responsibility and always blaming external forces. I can think of no better way to instill hopelessness and fear in a young person than to tell him he is a victim, powerless to change his circumstance.
During the civil-rights movement blacks never permitted oppression to define who we were. Instead we cultivated moral competence, enterprise and thrift, and viewed oppression as a stumbling block, not an excuse.
Dr. King would have refused to participate in today's identity politics gamesmanship because it frames its grievances in opposition to the American principles of freedom and equality that he sought to redeem. He upheld the country's founding principles and sought to destroy only what got in the way of delivering the promise of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, as well as the recognition that all men are created equal.
Last month the school board of Westfield, N.J., approved a history course on critical race theory, which is the embodiment of the oppressor narrative embraced by the left. At the board meeting a young woman spoke passionately in favor of the course, ending her comments by blaming slavery for the absence of black fathers in the home. This is how successful the left, with its lethal message of despair and distortion of history, has been at undermining agency within the black community.
To honor the legacy of Dr. King, we must not only acknowledge the evil he confronted, but also focus on his example in overcoming it. He persevered and triumphed in the face of evil because he was beholden to truth, honor and love for all mankind, driven as he was to see blacks share fully in the American dream. We must not let the purveyors of identity politics fudge the record: Martin Luther King Jr. believed in the promise of America. In fact, he helped to fulfill it.

Citizens United was a triumph for free speech

Texto completo: The Citizen's United case after 10 years? Let's recall first what that case was about and why a number of First Amendment aficionados such as myself have been drawn to support what has become one of the most maligned Supreme Court cases in American history.
In 2008, Citizens United was a conservative organization with a yearly budget of about $12 million. A small portion of that money was contributed by for-profit corporations. Citizens United prepared a film harshly denouncing Hillary Clinton at a time when she seemed to be the most likely Democratic nominee for president. (Barack Obama was later nominated and elected.)
Taken as a whole, as Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy later observed in his majority opinion in the case, the movie was “a full length negative advertisement that urges viewers to vote against Senator Clinton for President," a presentation that sought to persuade viewers that she was “unfit for the Presidency." But legislation then in effect criminalized airing — on television, cable, or satellite — advocacy for or against a candidate for president within 60 days of an election and 30 days before a primary if it was even partially funded by a corporation. As a result, the documentary could not be shown at times most likely to persuade viewers whom to vote for — or in this case, against.
From any First Amendment perspective, that was intolerable. No speech is as protected under the First Amendment as political speech and no political speech is as important as speech advocating whom to vote for, or against, for president. That is why the ACLU responded to the Citizens United ruling by explaining that it could “not support campaign finance regulation premised on the notion that the answer to money in politics is to ban political speech."
Yet because some of the money that funded Citizens United came from corporations, its political advocacy was silenced at the very time it could have had the greatest impact. The 5-4 decision in Citizens United held that any law having that effect violated the First Amendment and that corporations that had contributed to Citizens United could spend money from their corporate treasuries advocating the election or non-election of political candidates just as individuals could. The amounts spent, as federal law required, had to be publicly disclosed. But just as individuals could not constitutionally be limited in the amounts they could expend on political speech, neither could corporations.
Much of the public response to the Citizens United ruling was apoplectic. People who fully supported controversial Supreme Court rulings that, under the First Amendment, Nazis must be allowed to march and American flags to be burned, were appalled that corporations could play a serious role in the electoral process. The New York Times, itself owned by a corporation that was then the owner of this newspaper, spoke for many when it denounced the ruling on the ground that it would “thrust politics back to the robber-baron era of the 19th century" by allowing “corporations to use their vast treasuries to overwhelm elections." The San Francisco Chronicle predicted that “voters should prepare for the worst: cash-drenched elections presided over by free-spending corporations." The Washington Post warned that "corporate money, never lacking in the American political political process, may now overwhelm . . . the contribution of individuals."
But nothing of the sort has occurred in the 10 years since the court's ruling. What is true is that since Citizens United and as a sort of follow-up to it, so-called “super" political action committees were created, into which both individuals and corporations have made contributions. Those from individuals have dwarfed those from corporations. Here are the numbers from the entire 2016 election cycle — all federal elections from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. In that entire time, so-called super PACs received a total of $1.8 billion, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Of that amount, $1.05 billion came from individuals; labor organizations and other entities contributed $260 million; the contributions of all corporations totaled $113 million. When we compare the largest contributors in 2016, the 10 largest contributions from individuals totaled $377 million; the top 10 corporate contributions totaled less than $39 million. The figures were similar in 2018, a non-presidential year in which a total of about $1.5 billion was contributed to super PACs, of which less than $68 million came from corporations.
As these vast numbers suggest and as is no secret, there remain enormous, often incomparable, disparities in the amount of money held by those in the top fraction of the top one percent of our population and the rest of the public. This might be addressed by tax or other economically focused legislation. As the ACLU has urged, it should not be addressed by limiting speech about who should be elected.
As Justice Kennedy put it in Citizens United , speech is “the means to hold officials accountable to the people" and “political speech must prevail against laws that would suppress it by design or inadvertence." That was true a decade ago and it remains true today.
Floyd Abrams is Senior Counsel at the New York law firm of Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP and a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School. He represented Senator Mitch McConnell in the Citizens United case as amicus curiae and argued orally in support of the Court's ruling.

Texto completo: Yesterday this column asked why Americans should take the opinion of the Government Accountability Office seriously when it claims a Trump violation of law. Reviewing the same set of facts, House Democrats allege no such violation in their impeachment articles. The details of the GAO's argument raise more questions—including whether the GAO itself has faithfully followed the law.
Some questions involve the source of this exquisitely timed contribution to the impeachment debate, which was published on the first day of President Trump's Senate trial. Writing about GAO, Emily Cochrane, Eric Lipton and Chris Cameron assert in the New York Times:
The accountability office is an independent, nonpartisan agency that works for Congress.
Given how that sentence ends, it's not clear why the Times decided to call GAO "independent."
There's also a reasonable question about the use of the term "nonpartisan". A Journal reader raised this issue in a comment posted under Thursday's column. "The so-called 'nonpartisan' GAO's bureaucrats are represented by the AFL-CIO's International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers whose PAC in 2016 gave 100% of its donations to Democrats and 0% to Republicans. This creature of Congress is a perfect example of the swamp," writes Gary Jarmin.
Mr. Jarmin's report on political donations is correct, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which posts Federal Election Commission data on its OpenSecrets website.
As for Thursday's news-making memo , GAO acknowledges in a footnote that its opinion was rendered at the request of Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.), who repeatedly prodded GAO staff to say whether they agreed with his claim of a Trump legal violation.
But in the body of its opinion, GAO doesn't say it's acting to serve one of its legislative bosses but instead claims: "Pursuant to our role under the [Impoundment Control Act], we are issuing this decision."
The relevant portion of the law is section 686, and this creates a potential problem for the agency as it claims to be doing more than simply Sen. Van Hollen's bidding.
A former Member of Congress argues via email:
The opinion is not what section 686 requires. This brief statutory section mandates that GAO report on a deferral of budget authority that the president has failed to notify Congress about. The purpose of this mandate on GAO is to let Congress know in a timely way, so that Congress can do something about the withholding of funds (i.e., make sure that they are spent as required by law).
In order for this statutory provision to do any good, GAO needs to let Congress know within weeks, not months or years. Appropriations are annual. The fiscal year ends September 30. The Impoundment Control Act gives Congress 45 days after notification to veto a deferral.
Under section 686 GAO "shall" make a report on the deferral to both Houses of Congress. The GAO report then operates as if it were the required notification from the President. That gives Congress 45 days to act (or, if the notice comes with less than 45 days remaining in the fiscal year, until September 30).
Here, by not acting until the fourth month of the following fiscal year, GAO failed to do what section 686 requires.
Is there an impeachment process for GAO officials?

The Vegetarian-Industrial Complex? "It's almost unheard of for medical journals to get blowback for studies before the data are published," writes Rita Rubin in the Journal of the American Medical Association. "But that's what happened to the Annals of Internal Medicine last fall as editors were about to post several studies showing that the evidence linking red meat consumption with cardiovascular disease and cancer is too weak to recommend that adults eat less of it."
Annals Editor-in-Chief Christine Laine, M.D. tells Ms. Rubin that an outfit called the True Health Initiative was particularly caustic in criticizing the idea that red meat might not be as dangerous as many Americans have been led to believe.
Ms. Rubin adds:
The True Health Initiative (THI) is a nonprofit founded and headed by David Katz, MD... Walter Willett, MD, DrPH, and Frank Hu, MD, PhD, Harvard nutrition researchers who are among the top names in their field, serve on the THI council of directors.
Katz, Willett, and Hu took the rare step of contacting Laine about retracting the studies prior to their publication, she recalled in an interview with JAMA.
...Subsequent news coverage criticized the methodology used in the meat papers and raised the specter that some of the authors had financial ties to the beef industry, representing previously undisclosed conflicts of interest.
But what has for the most part been overlooked is that Katz and THI and many of its council members have numerous industry ties themselves. The difference is that their ties are primarily with companies and organizations that stand to profit if people eat less red meat and a more plant-based diet. Unlike the beef industry, these entities are surrounded by an aura of health and wellness, although that isn't necessarily evidence-based.

To Understand America, Look to Its College Sports; Nowhere else on Earth is so much money spent in pursuit of the amateur ideal

Texto completo: As we approach Super Bowl weekend, the closest thing America has to a national cultural festival, I'm struck that one of the great pleasures and puzzles of life for an immigrant here is the nature of sports and their primacy in the national consciousness.
Few things capture the notion of American exceptionalism as well as its team sports. Take professional leagues first: None of the major pro sports here—football, baseball, basketball or hockey—is played to anything like the same level outside North America.
This always induces some supercilious snickering among foreigners. The notion, for example, that prevailing among the 29 U.S. and one Canadian teams each year on the baseball diamond confers the title of "World Champions" seems a classic case of American epistemic isolationism. It would be like calling that entertainingly ridiculous English rustic activity where border collies herd reluctant woolly livestock into pens the Sheepdog Trials World Series.
Some at this point will raise cricket. But while only a handful of countries may play the game, those nations account for about a quarter of the world's population. So when the winner of cricket's international competition calls itself "World Champion," it means something. (It's currently England, by the way, as I'm sure you knew.)
Individual sports have always been different. Americans have excelled internationally at golf, tennis and Olympic events, but somehow, in team effort, the U.S. doesn't play well with others.
Basketball, it's true, has an increasingly global reach. Next week, the Milwaukee Bucks, currently the top team in the NBA, who boast as their star player a young man from Athens (Greece, not Georgia), will play a regular season game in Paris. But this is still an American team playing in an American league, albeit by and for foreigners.
Soccer, as Americans insist on calling football, is the global game sans pareil. America's repeated attempts to excel at an international level have been of limited success (except for the very talented women) and seem to be going nowhere.
But the most powerful and enduring feature of U.S. athletic exceptionalism is surely college sports, a uniquely American phenomenon. There cannot be a place on Earth where so much money is spent in pursuit of the amateur ideal.
England does have its annual Boat Race. But in a prime example of entrenched national elitism, only two universities, Oxford and Cambridge, are allowed to compete for it. The crews themselves are largely made up of Americans in their seventh year of graduate work in agronomy or applied social-media studies who also happen to be Olympic gold medalists. And while the race on the Thames is nationally televised, rights go for about the price of a season ticket to the University of Alabama's football games.
It's easy to be cynical about college sports: the money, the hypocrisy around supposed amateurism, the dubious academic status of some of the athletes, the privileges they enjoy.
Just this week, that cynicism was on display when a New York Times staffer tweeted about how absurd it was that Louisiana State University called off classes for two days during the national football championship (which LSU won). It was no use pointing out that the university was simply adding the two days on to the end of this semester. The metropolitan elitism that looks down from the august heights of Ivy League self-esteem on the centrality of athletic programs to so many colleges is quite entrenched.
I too was once a little cynical. Isn't higher education about elevating the mind? Doesn't all the money and attention paid to college sports skew perceptions and priorities?
But I've seen it up close in the past decade through my daughters, and I must say that the unique nature of college sports to American culture is a critical part of its success.
Of course, the billions of dollars that college sport generates helps make American higher education the best funded in the world. And what's wrong with exposing disadvantaged young people, who take many of the athletic scholarships, to the academic experience?
Above all, there is the idealism and esprit de corps that sport engenders. To a European mind, clouded by post-idealistic cynicism, rooting for your college is impossibly crass. But college spirit helps many Americans develop a powerful sense of community and belonging. God knows that's needed in our atomistic and hyperpartisan world.

Texto completo: Three more suspected neo-Nazis connected to a white nationalist group that reportedly planned to have members at a gun rights rally in Virginia have been arrested, authorities say.
Three Georgia men were arrested on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and participating in a criminal street gang as part of the hate group, The Base, according to the Floyd County Police Department.
News of the arrests come a day after three other suspected members of The Base were arrested in Maryland on firearms and alien-harboring charges.
The three Georgia men, identified as Luke Austin Lane of Floyd County, Michael Helterbrand of Dalton and Jacob Kaderli of Dacula, were planning to "overthrow the government and murder a Bartow County couple," Floyd County police said in a statement.
Lane, who was arrested near his home without incident Wednesday, and Kaderli are being housed in Floyd County, and Helterbrand is to arrive later Friday, police said. Lane was also denied bond Thursday.
It was not immediately clear if the Georgia men planned to attend the Virginia rally. Multiple media outlets reported Thursday that the men in Maryland planned to attend, and authorities moved on them in fears they might incite violence.
The string of arrests come as Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency ahead of Monday's gun rights rally and banned all weapons, including firearms, in the area around the state Capitol in Richmond.
A judge upheld Northam's ban Thursday, but rally organizers are seeking an appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court. It was not clear when the court would hear the appeal.
Attorney General Mark Herring wrote in a legal brief to the court Friday that Northam has the authority to issue the order for public safety and that it does not infringe on anyone's right to bear arms or First Amendment rights.
Northam declared the state of emergency after he says law enforcement received multiple credible threats of violence by militias and extremists groups planning to attend the rally Monday.
Fearing violence similar to that of Charlottesville, where a woman was killed when a neo-Nazi rammed his car into a crowd in 2017, Northam issued the temporary ban on weapons through Tuesday.
"They're not coming to peacefully protest. They are coming to intimidate and cause harm," Northam said at a news conference earlier this week.
"No one wants another incident like the one we saw at Charlottesville in 2017. We will not allow that mayhem and violence to happen here," he added.
The Virginia Citizens Defense League, the group organizing the rally and challenging Northam in court alongside Gun Owners of America, has said the event is still on. The group planned the "lobby day" to try to sway state legislators not to pass a host of gun control measures that Democrats have promised after taking control of state government in November.
Following the election, more than 100 localities in Virginia declared themselves "sanctuaries" for the Second Amendment, saying they wouldn't enforce unconstitutional laws. Legal experts and Herring have said those resolutions hold no legal weight as local law does not supersede state law.
However, as momentum grew with the sanctuary resolutions and planning of the lobby day, the movement spilled across state lines and onto pro-gun social media, sparking interest from groups outside of Virginia.
Groups identified as extremist organizations urged members to flock to Richmond on Monday, using fiery language of "tyrants" trying to seize arms and promising civil war.
Some of the militia groups that said they would attend the rally in Richmond are the same ones who attended the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, the Daily Beast reported.
The Base, the group of which the six men arrested this week allegedly are members, has been identified as a hate group committed to creating a white ethno-state. Police in Georgia say the group, founded around July 2018, seeks to "accelerate the downfall of the United States government, incite a race war and establish a white ethno-state. "
One of the men arrested in Maryland, Patrik Jordan Mathews, 27, is a former Canadian Armed Forces reservist who was dismissed over ties to white supremacists; he allegedly entered the U. S. illegally in August.
According to an arrest affidavit, the Georgia men were arrested in connection with an undercover FBI operation during which an agent was accepted into the group and gained access to its encrypted online messaging applications.
The three men allegedly planned to murder a couple they believed to members of Antifa, the anti-fascist group. According to an arrest affidavit, Lane spearheaded the plot to kill the couple with the help of Kaderli and Helterbrand, however, the operation was delayed, in part because Helterbrand said he had a bad back.
On at least two occasions, the men along with the undercover agent drove to the couple's house to scope it out, the affidavit says. They also discussed burning the house down after the hit, the affidavit says.
At one point in the planning, the men discussed what would happen if their victims had children. Lane told Helterbrand they would "probably just leave them," but Helterbrand said he'd have "no problem killing a commie kid," the affidavit says.
The men allegedly settled on a February date to commit the murders. Lane also identified future targets who were members of television media, the affidavit says.
Lane also allegedly said he wanted to kill other members of The Base who knew about the plot and whom he feared would discuss it. According to the affidavit, a member of The Base in Maryland and one who had recently entered the United State illegally were his targets, however, those members were not named.
The affidavit describes the group as operating with regional cells for security purposes.
In Maryland, prosecutors said at a court hearing Wednesday that one of the men compared The Base to al-Qaida and discussed traveling to Ukraine to fight alongside "nationalists. "
Prosecutors say Brian Mark Lemley Jr. , 33, and William Garfield Bilbrough IV, 19, traveled to Michigan last year to pick up Mathews. The men have allegedly operated in Maryland and Delaware since, building an assault rifle, amassing ammo and trying to make DMT, a hallucinogenic drug, as they discussed The Base's activities.
The New York Times reported that The Base has become a growing concern for the FBI as the group recruits more people.

Texto completo: Ready or not, we believe the time has come for New Jersey's next great musical reunion. What the world needs now are Fugees.
Jersey fresh artists such My Chemical Romance of Belleville, The Misfits from Lodi, New Brunswick's The Gaslight Anthem and the Jonas Brothers out of Wyckoff have all made the rounds on the lucrative reunion circuit in recent years.
But the long-gone Essex County trio of South Orange native Lauryn Hill, the Haitian-born and Newark-raised Wyclef Jean and Irvington native Prakazrel "Pras" Michel were one of American music's defining acts in the mid-1990s. It's time to remind the world why.
They were far from prolific, releasing only two albums — 1994's "Blunted on Reality" and 1996's "The Score."
That sophomore album had monster singles galore — the Roberta Flack cover "Killing Me Softly With His Song," "Fu-Gee-La" and the haunting "Ready or Not" — as well as a cult favorite cover of Bob Marley's cover of "No Woman, No Cry."
While the bombastic "Blunted" didn't make much of a sales splash, "The Score" soared; it was released in February 1996, and by October 1997 it had moved more than 6 million units and reached the top of the Billboard 200, according to a 2016 Billboard retrospective.
Listening back to "The Score" now, it's easy to see why it shook the world.
Nearly a quarter century after its release, the album still resonates as a vividly fluid sonic statement that defies constraints of genre and time, as Brick City rhymes flow seamlessly with samples from The Flamingos and Enya to create a lush, cinematic tapestry of sound.
If anything, the group has only become more timely; their name, an abbreviation of refugees. served as "a reference to the diminished status that poor emigrants from countries such as Haiti encounter in the United States," according to a 1996 Rolling Stone profile.
Decades later, the American government's changing policies toward refugees from around the world entering the country remains a topical, contentious issue.
This was a beautiful North Jersey musical melting pot which earned a pair of 1997 Grammys — Best Rap Album and Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for "Killing Me Softly With His Song" — and also was nominated for Album of the Year (it lost to Celine Dion's "Falling Into You," co-produced by Roy Bittan of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band).
Their too-brief body of work made an undeniable impact. Rolling Stone named "The Score" one of the best albums of the 1990s and one of the best albums of all time, while the Asbury Park Press dubbed them the second-greatest hip-hop act to ever come out of New Jersey (behind only Naughty by Nature).
Following "The Score," each of the Fuguees found massive solo success.
The 1997 album "Wyclef Jean presents The Carnival featuring Refugee Allstars" boasted the hit "Gone Till November," and the following year Pras dominated the airwaves with the "Bulworth" soundtrack single "Ghetto Superstar (That is What You Are)."
Then there was the juggernaut of early solo-era Hill. "The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" in 1998 had the hits "Doo Wop (That Thing)" and "Everything is Everything," and won five Grammy Awards, becoming the first rap album to ever win the Grammy for Album of the Year.
In the 20-plus years since the Fugees' cultural domination, Jean in particular has remained a highly in-demand producer and collaborator, working with the likes of Whitney Houston (1998's "My Love is Your Love"), Santana (1999's "Maria Maria," the basis of DJ Khaled's "Wild Thoughts"), Destiny's Child (1998's "No, No, No Pt. 2") and Shakira (2005's "Hips Don't Lie").
The next generation of New Jersey musical talent event benefited from Jean's wisdom when he visited Asbury Park in 2018 to work with the youth of the Asbury Park Music Foundation and performed at that year's Asbury Park Music and Film Festival.
But they've only been heard from sporadically as a unit during this millennium; there was a 2004 Brooklyn show filmed for the 2006 documentary "Dave Chapelle's Block Party," then in 2005 a BET Awards appearance, a European tour and a single, "Take it Easy."
As recently as 2018, Pras told New York hip-hop radio station Hot 97 FM that the group had been offered $90 million for a 15-month tour, but both Jean and Hill were non-committal.
Each member has experienced troubles and controversies in recent years. Hill served three months in a Connecticut federal prison in 2013 after failing to pay taxes while Jean's charity, Yéle, was scrutinized in a 2012 New York Times article.
Earlier this year, Pras was charged by U.S. prosecutors with making donations to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign as a proxy for Jho Low, who served as an adviser to former Malaysia prime minister Najib Razak.
Commercial hip-hop was born in New Jersey, thanks to the Sugarhill Gang's landmark 1979 recording of "Rapper's Delight" for Sylvia Robinson's Englewood-based Sugar Hill Records.
The artform's rich, shared history with New Jersey was in the spotlight when MTV brought its Video Music Awards to the Prudential Center in Newark in August 2019.
Several of the state's hip-hop luminaries shared the stage together, including Queen Latifah, Naughty by Nature, Redman and Fetty Wap.
Wyclef was there, too, guitar in hand, to perform a verse and chorus of "Gone Till November" and some of "No Woman, No Cry" and then jam out as part of the grand finale on Naughty by Nature's "Hip Hop Hooray."
The celebration couldn't help but feel a little hollow; a singular commemoration of New Jersey's place in hip-hop history deserved more direct Fugees representation than a bit of a Bob Marley song that they also covered.
New Jersey's musical reunion boom in recent years has been great for representing the state's rock 'n' roll and pop history, reminding folks around the world that the Misfits were more than inspiration for a T-shirt line and proving that Gerard Way had a pretty good gig going before he created "Umbrella Academy."
Now it's time to do the same for Jersey's hip-hop legacy.
In their prime, Lauryn Hill, Wyclef Jean and Pras Michel created a whole that was somehow greater than the sum of its considerable parts.
The Fugees' lush, boundary-pushing universal sound would hit just as hard today as it did back in 1996, the artists and audience once again vibing on a truly global frequency.

Texto completo: An associate of President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani spent the last few days making incendiary accusations against Trump and top administration officials over their alleged involvement in a pressure campaign in Ukraine.
Soviet-born businessman Lev Parnas is alleged to worked on the pressure campaign to have Ukraine officials open an investigation into the family of former Vice President Joe Biden, an accusation at the center of Trump's impeachment. And this week, he's dished what he knows to a number of national media outlets.
His chief claim was revealed in a Wednesday interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. Parnas asserted Trump "knew exactly what was going on" in a campaign to pressure the Ukrainian government to open politically motivated investigations.
Democrats have cited the interviews he has given and the thousands of pages of documents he produced on Tuesday as further evidence of the Trump administration's involvement and knowledge in the scheme.
Republicans, on the other hand, assail Parnas' credibility given the federal campaign finance charges he faces. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Parnas is "desperate to reduce his exposure to prison. "
Here is everything Parnas has said so far about Trump and top administration officials:
Trump 'was aware of all my movements'
Parnas said Trump was fully aware of everything he was doing in Ukraine.
"President Trump knew exactly what was going on," Parnas told Rachel Maddow.
“He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani, or the president," he added.
Parnas told The New York Times he did not speak directly with Trump about Ukraine but met him several times. Giuliani kept Trump informed of their efforts, Parnas said to the Times.
“I am betting my whole life that Trump knew exactly everything that was going on that Rudy Giuliani was doing in Ukraine,” Mr. Parnas told the Times.
Trump denies knowing Parnas.
“I don’t believe I’ve ever spoken to him," Trump told reporters on Thursday.
More: Donald Trump says he doesn't know Lev Parnas. Parnas says he has pictures with Trump
More: Lev Parnas, ex-Rudy Giuliani ally, wants to testify against Trump to win leniency. Sound familiar?
Pence 'of course' knew
In a Thursday interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, Parnas said "of course" Vice President Mike Pence was aware of what Giuliani and his associates were doing in Ukraine.
"I don't know if the Vice President knew everything we were doing," he added.
When asked a follow-up question about Pence's awareness of a "quid pro quo" with Ukraine, Parnas said he was sure Pence was aware of the "serious situation" because all top administration officials knew of the issue.
"Everybody that was close to Trump knew this was a thorn in the side and this was a serious situation," Parnas said.
Parnas told both CNN and MSNBC he informed top Ukrainian officials Pence would not come to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration unless an announcement of an investigation into the Bidens was made.
The day after he delivered his message, Parnas said he found out "that Pence is not going to be there. "
Pence, for his part, has denied any knowledge of the alleged Ukraine scheme.
Pence said Thursday that Parnas' accusations were "completely false. " When asked if he knew Parnas, he said, "I don’t know the guy. "
Energy Secretary Rick Perry 'definitely' knew about Giuliani
According to Parnas' interview with MSNBC, he found out from Giuliani that then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry would attend Zelensky's inauguration after Pence opted not to go.
"When we were in Paris with Rudy, that's when I found out they were going to send Perry instead," Parnas said.
"I don't know to what extent he knew about me. . . . but definitely he knew about Rudy since he called Rudy on his way there to ask him what to discuss [with the Ukrainians]," Parnas said.
Additionally, Parnas said it was Perry's job to tell the Ukrainians that aid was conditioned on the announcement of a Biden investigation.
Giuliani "blew his lid," in Parnas' recounting, when he found out the Ukrainians wanted to make an announcement about corruption, and not about the Bidens and Burisma.
Perry has also asserted his lack of knowledge of the situation in Ukraine and said Giuliani never mentioned anything about the Bidens or Burisma to him.
Attorney General William Barr 'had to have known everything'
In the MSNBC interview, Parnas said Attorney General William Barr was "basically on the team" involved with the Ukraine pressure campaign and "absolutely" knew of their efforts.
"Mr. Barr had to have known everything," Parnas told Maddow. "I mean, it's impossible. "
That said, Parnas said he "personally did not speak to him," referring to Barr.
Met with Devin Nunes 'several times'
On MSNBC, Parnas said he met "several times" with Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif. , the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee.
"He was looking into this Ukraine stuff. He wanted to help out. "
"I was in shock" watching the House Intelligence Committee impeachment hearings, Parnas said, because Nunes and a top aide "were involved in getting stuff on Biden. "
Nunes said in a Thursday interview with Fox News, he remembered an "odd" call with Parnas that had shown up in phone records produced by the House Intelligence Committee.
"I remember that call, which was very odd, random, talking about random things," Nunes said.
In a previous interview, Nunes said he did not remember any details from the call. Later, in December, Nunes said after checking his phone records he recalled getting a call from someone he didn't know and referring him to his staff.

Q&amp;A: The Rep serves up a satirical feast with 'The Thanksgiving Play'

Texto completo: Some folks might be confused by the title of "The Thanksgiving Play," which runs through Feb. 9 at the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis.
It's January, right? So isn't a satirical play referencing the holiday associated with Native Americans, Pilgrims and, perhaps most of all, turkeys a bit late?
Actually, no -- as playwright Larissa FastHorse, a member of the Sicangu Lakota nation of South Dakota, explained recently. The production, staged in the Emerson Studio Theatre, is directed by associate artistic director Amelia Acosta Powell.
The interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Q - How did you get the idea for the play, which focuses on theater artists struggling to create a Thanksgiving-themed piece that's politically correct? Was it in response to difficulties in finding indigenous actors to perform in your plays?
A - I gave myself the challenge of writing a play that had no obviously indigenous people in it, because I was frustrated with the lack of casting of indigenous people in my plays. From there, I wanted to deal with a holiday, and that's where it started.
Q - According to American Theatre magazine, "The Thanksgiving Play" is among the most produced American plays of the 2019-20 season. That must be gratifying.
A - It's pretty crazy, and it's pretty exciting.
Q - And you wrote the play in just 10 days?
A - The first draft, yes. I'm a very organic writer, and once the characters start talking to me, I just have to start typing and keep up with them until they finish.
Q - What prompted you to pursue a career in playwriting?
A - Playwriting found me. I was a classical ballet dancer in my first career. And then I was writing, and I looked around and the only playwrights I knew had degrees, and I didn't have a degree in anything. So I was in Los Angeles and decided to become a film and TV writer. I put myself through a program that I created for myself -- being an intern for an executive at Universal (Pictures), and then working at Paramount as a creative executive, and eventually writing my own pieces.
Q - Has your experience as a dancer influenced your playwriting?
A - Absolutely. "The Thanksgiving Play" is a perfect example. There are several sections in it that are movement-based, and all of my plays depend on large movement sections of some kind -- whether it's a fight scene or some type of physical comedy. I really trust movement to tell stories onstage, and it's interesting because often people say that they don't realize how theatrical my pieces are when they read them.
Q - In a 2018 review of "The Thanksgiving Play," which was produced off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons, the New York Times observed that "the familiar whitewashed story of Pilgrims and Native Americans chowing down together gets a delicious roasting from expert farceurs." Does the play's title ever create any confusion about when it should be scheduled?
A - It's produced at all times of the year. But some people are saying that they'll produce it at any time except Thanksgiving (laughter). So it's a lot of fun.
---

Texto completo: LONDON - The governments of five countries that lost citizens when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner demanded Thursday that Tehran accept "full responsibility" and pay compensation to the victims' families - though they had little to offer besides moral pressure to get Iran to comply.
After a meeting in London, foreign ministers from Canada, the U.K., Afghanistan, Sweden and Ukraine urged Iran to allow a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation," as well as a criminal probe and "impartial" judicial proceedings against those found responsible for downing the plane.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft died when it was brought down by ballistic missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Jan. 8.
The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens, as well as Iranians.
Before the meeting at the Canadian High Commission, ministers from the five nations lit candles at a vigil in memory of the dead passengers and crew members.
Iran initially blamed a technical fault for the plane crash, before acknowledging in the face of mounting evidence that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard had accidentally brought down the jetliner.
In keeping with international norms, Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, the United States and France to take part in the crash investigation. But it's unclear whether Iran will share all key details or give the countries full access.
FBI plans to notify states about election breaches at local level
WASHINGTON - The FBI, in a change of policy, is committing to inform state officials if local election systems have been breached, federal officials said Thursday.
In the past, the FBI would alert local governments about attacks on their electoral systems without automatically sharing that information with the state. That meant state officials, left in the dark, might be in a position of certifying the accuracy of election results without realizing there had been problems in individual counties. Alerting local governments about breaches, but not the states, was in keeping with FBI policy of protecting the privacy and identities of actual hacking victims.
Now, though, the FBI will notify both counties victimized by breaches as well as the state's chief election official, and the notification is to be done in person.
Guatemala sweeps up migrants, returns them to the border
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala - Guatemalan police accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up the majority of a group of about 300 migrants Thursday, loaded them on buses and took them back to the Honduran border, effectively dashing their plans to travel together in a "caravan" with hopes of reaching the United States.
Praying and singing songs, the group of adults, teens and young children had set out from a shelter in Entre Rios under rainy skies before dawn and walked about six hours before stopping in the town of Morales to eat and rest.
There they were challenged by police who asked for their entry documents, and nearly all had crossed into Guatemala irregularly and didn't have such documentation.
Prince Harry takes on first duties since royal crisis talks
LONDON - Prince Harry went back to work Thursday, mixing with children playing rugby and offering no hint of the days of turmoil that followed his recent announcement that he wished to step back from royal duties and become financially independent.
It was a fairly standard event for Harry, who watched as children from a local school offer a rugby demonstration on the Buckingham Palace grounds. It marked the first time Harry had taken on a public engagement since announcing last week that he and his wife, Meghan, needed a change.
He joked with the kids and shook hands, but ignored a journalist's question about his future.
Queen Elizabeth II brokered a deal Monday for "a period of transition" to sort out how to be a part-time royal.
Iran's president says 'no limit' to nuke enrichment
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that there is "no limit" to the country's enrichment of uranium after its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general by the U.S.
In a speech, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a "better situation" than it was before the agreement with world powers.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018 and has since imposed "maximum" sanctions on Iran's economy.
Iran abided by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. After the Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.
Pope names 1st woman manager in top office
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has tapped an Italian lawyer to be the first woman to hold a management position in the Vatican's most important office, the Secretariat of State.
Francis named Francesca Di Giovanni, a 27-year veteran of the Vatican, as undersecretary for multilateral affairs. She will be responsible for running a division that coordinates the Holy See's relations with the U.N. and other intergovernmental organizations.
Francis has called for women in decision-making roles in the Vatican and Catholic Church at large, though none heads a Vatican congregation or other key office, positions reserved for priests, bishops or cardinals.
Di Giovanni, 66, told the Vatican's in-house media that Francis' appointment Wednesday showed his attention to women.
In Oregon: A teenager who was taken out of state by her mother to avoid surgery for a rare type of liver cancer has had the operation after state welfare officials took her into custody, several Portland, Oregon, TV outlets reported Thursday.
Kylee Dixon, 13, was recovering in an intensive care unit after surgery Tuesday to remove liver tumors.
The Dixons traveled to Las Vegas in June after prosecutors say Christine Dixon refused to turn her daughter over to the state for the surgery. Christine Dixon has said months of chemotherapy debilitated her daughter and that she did much better on CBD oil, a non-psychoactive compound extracted from cannabis plants and other alternative therapies.

Texto completo: Australian-American Annapolis Mayor Gavin Buckley grew up with bush fires, but not of the magnitude seen on the continent in recent weeks. According to The New York Times, 25 million acres have burned, more than a billion animals have perished and at least 24 people have died.
Buckley is helping to organize a fundraiser at Fado Irish Pub on Jan. 25 at 1 p.m. to benefit the Australian Red Cross and WIRES, the New South Wales Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Service Inc., which rescues and rehabilitates wildlife.
WIRES describes a bit of what they're facing on the ground on their website, in calling for donations to its emergency fund. "With species such as koalas and grey-headed flying-foxes already listed as vulnerable to extinction, the additional loss of life caused by emergencies like the fires and drought is even more devastating."
Buckley says the fires show the need to act on climate change policy immediately, and that resilience to climate change will mean adapting in different ways in different places.
"In Australia it means drought, in Annapolis it means flooding, in Ellicott City it means flash flooding," he said. "We've been asleep at the wheel when it comes to the environment."
He said meat pies and stuffed sausages, typical Australian fare, will be available at the event. The event will be held one day before Australia Day, Jan. 26, which celebrates the arrival of the first British Fleet at Sydney Cove. It is also referred to by some Australians, including indigenous Australians, as Survival Day, the Day of Mourning or Invasion Day.
On Jan. 20, Mission Escape Room locations including Arundel Mills will donate 100% of sales from the day to WIRES and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service.
A post on the business' social media promoting the fundraiser says to book online using the code AUS100.

In US talks, Taliban offer to curb violence in Afghanistan

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction - though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days - and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire - in which no attacks are carried out - without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

After Jeffrey Epstein suicide, Bureau of Prisons tells guards: Stop surfing the web and watch inmates

Resumen: Two corrections officers face criminal charges for claiming they checked on Jeffrey Epstein and other inmates. Feds say they slept and browsed online.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON – The federal Bureau of Prisons is curtailing staffers' access to the internet and cellphones to guard against “unnecessary distractions” that allegedly contributed to correction officers' failure to prevent the suicide of accused child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“When on the job, your full attention should be focused on the behavior of the inmates in your charge and the activity going on around you,” Director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer wrote in an agencywide memorandum distributed last week.
A ban on government-issued cellphone use “within the secure perimeter of each institution” has already taken effect, Hawk Sawyer wrote, and there are plans to expand that to smartwatches with texting functions. Staffers' personal cellphones have been largely banned from federal prisons for some time.
“Some internet access will soon be curtailed so that distractions will be eliminated,” she wrote. Access to the internet on government devices and computers would be allowed “only to complete required daily work. ”
"We must not allow technology to be our enemy by taking our eyes and ears off the interactions around us or limit our face-to-face interaction with staff and inmates," she wrote. "Ours is a people business. "
BOP spokeswoman Nancy Ayers said the changes are part of a "back to basics approach, emphasizing sound correctional management. " The effort to limit the distractions of government computers, smartwatches and other technology is part of a larger effort to improve safety and security, she said.
In the memo, Hawk Sawyer made only indirect references to the cascading failures disclosed after Epstein's suicide at the Manhattan Correctional Center in August.
Two corrections officers have been charged with falsifying duty logs to allegedly cover for time spent sleeping and browsing the internet when they should have been patrolling the unit where Epstein was housed.
Falsifying records: Two federal prison officers were charged with falsifying records on Jeffrey Epstein rounds
Deleted surveillance video: Prison 'inadvertently' deleted surveillance video outside cell during Jeffrey Epstein's first suicide attempt, feds say
Federal prosecutors alleged that guards didn't perform any inmate checks from 10:30 p. m. on Aug. 9 to 6:30 a. m. the following morning, when officers discovered Epstein had hanged himself with a bedsheet.
During that time, according to court documents, officers should have conducted five separate inmate counts in the high-security unit.
Both officers have pleaded not guilty.
Hawk Sawyer told the Senate Judiciary Committee in November that Epstein's suicide was a "black eye on the entire Bureau of Prisons. "
"We have some bad staff; we want to get rid of bad staff," she said. "The only time we ever get noticed is when something bad happens. "
Indeed, the incident prompted Attorney General William Barr to appoint Hawk Sawyer to lead the agency, which has been riven by staffing shortages and allegations of sexual harassment brought by female officers. The appointment brought Hawk Sawyer, a former federal prison psychologist, back to the agency she led between 1992 and 2003.

Union officials cautioned against a blanket prohibition on internet access, saying employees need web access to complete some of the agency's most basic operations, including restocking supplies.
After Epstein's suicide, "I expected something," said Shane Fausey, national president of the prison workers union. "But I'm not sure (Hawk Sawyer) understands how much of our work now has some interface with the internet. "
Ayers said the need for technology to "perform vital job functions for specific duties and positions will be reviewed, and access will be tailored accordingly. "
Joe Rojas, vice president of the union's southeast region, called the director's internet and phone restrictions an "overreaction to the Epstein case. "
Apart from the new communications and technology limits, Fausey and Rojas said the director's memo contained a proposal that has particularly rankled staffers.
Hawk Sawyer wrote that the agency is reevaluating the use of so-called compressed work schedules, in which thousands of prison staffers work four 10-hour days each week in exchange for an extra day off.
"It's one of the most popular benefits we have to offer employees who can better manage their work and personal lives," Fausey said.
Those schedules will be reviewed, according to Hawk Sawyer, to see whether they reduce productivity, increase costs or degrade the quality of staffers' work.
Fausey said many of the agency's woes could be addressed by tending to persistent staffing shortages across the country, including the Manhattan facility where Epstein was housed. For years, personnel shortages have required prisons to fill gaps by deploying teachers, clerical workers, kitchen staffers and nurses to work guard shifts.
Hawk Sawyer said in the memo that filling vacancies "continues to be our highest priority in 2020. " Although the agency hired 3,500 new staffers in 2019, the director said the bureau lost 2,700 to retirements and other departures.
"Until the agency hires an adequate amount of staff, you can point the finger where you want," Fausey said, "but it always comes back to not having enough people to operate prisons efficiently and safely. "

Texto completo: Gladys Bourdain, a longtime copy editor at The New York Times who helped kick-start the writing career of her son Anthony, the chef who became a world-famous memoirist and television host, died Friday at a hospice facility in the Bronx. She was 85.
Her son Christopher confirmed the death. He said she had been in failing health for some time.
Gladys Bourdain began her career at The Times in 1984 and worked there until 2008, developing a reputation as a strict grammarian on the culture and metropolitan desks. She also wrote for outlets like Opera News, Musical America and The Times.
She profiled Julia Child for The Times in 1978 after a visit to Child's home in Southern France, describing her kitchen as "organized clutter."
Anthony Bourdain became a hard-living chef, and in the late 1990s he wrote an article chronicling the seamier secrets of life in the restaurant business. He was struggling to publish it in 1999 when Gladys Bourdain mentioned to him that she knew a Times reporter, Esther Fein, who was married to David Remnick, the newly minted editor of The New Yorker magazine.
"She came over, and she said, 'You know, your husband's got this new job,' " Fein (who left The Times in 1999) said Monday. "'I hate to sound like a pushy mom, but I'm telling you this with my editor's hat on, not my mother's hat on. It's really good, and it's really interesting, but nobody will look at it, nobody will call him back or give it a second look. Could you put it in your husband's hands?'"
Fein persuaded Remnick to read the article, and The New Yorker published it under the title "Don't Eat Before Reading This." Anthony Bourdain later said that he had a book deal in a matter of days after that.
Expanding on the article, he wrote "Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly" (2000), an unflinching look at the food service industry that became a No. 1 New York Times bestseller.
The book's success propelled Anthony Bourdain from a brasserie kitchen onto television, as the host of "No Reservations" and "Parts Unknown," on which he traveled the world sampling different foods and engaging with different cultures.
Anthony Bourdain took his own life in 2018 at 61.
Gladys Bourdain memorialized her son with a tattoo of his name on her wrist -- her first and only tattoo.
Gladys Sacksman was born in Manhattan on Oct. 19, 1934, to Martha and Milton Sacksman. Her father operated a small trucking company, and her mother was a homemaker.
She grew up in the University Heights neighborhood of the Bronx and attended what is now Lehman College in that borough. She worked for TV Guide, The Record of Bergen County, New Jersey, and Agence France-Presse before joining The Times.
She married Pierre Bourdain in 1954. They separated in 1980. Pierre Bourdain died in 1987. In addition to her son Christopher, she is survived by three grandchildren.

In US talks, Taliban offer to curb violence in Afghanistan

Texto completo: The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction -- though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days -- and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire -- in which no attacks are carried out -- without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Let's talk about that can-a-woman-be-president thing [Corrected 01/18/2020]

Texto completo: We've spent a remarkable amount of time this week discussing whether there's sexism in politics.
Hahahahaha.
OK, no need to be cynical. Let's look on the positive side first. If you are around Elizabeth Warren's age of 70, you've had the incredible luck to live through a period of history in which American women's rights and opportunities have been transformed. There are still people alive who were born when women couldn't vote. Now we've got Nancy Pelosi giving a herd of male leaders their marching orders in Congress.
This doesn't mean all the battles are won. We've got only nine female governors, and a lot of people of both sexes really don't believe the country will elect any female president.
How you look at this depends a lot on why you think Hillary Clinton lost. Yes, she did get 2.8 million more votes than Donald Trump. But we can't spend the day bewailing the existence of the Electoral College.
Back to the question. Why do you think she lost?
"Sexism."
"Failure to campaign in Wisconsin."
"She won! She won! She won! She ----"
Sorry about that sharp elbow, but I told you we weren't going there. Next you're going to be moaning about Al Gore.
"Al Gore won!"
That's it. Unless you have a special interest in the election of Benjamin Harrison.
"Grover Cleveland was robbed!"
You understand we need to move on here, right? Personally, I've always suspected that Clinton lost -- to the degree that she lost -- not so much because of her gender as because people just wanted a change. She'd been a starring player in two eight-year administrations. It was pretty clear what we were going to get in another Clinton presidency, and it wasn't going to be anything dramatically new.
(This is what happens when you get a little bit bored with life and decide you want to juice things up. You spend $50,000 on a new sports car and then drive it into a restaurant takeout window. Or far worse, you elect Donald Trump.)
The whole can-a-woman-be-president issue came up during Tuesday's debate. Warren had one of her best moments when she pointed out that the male candidates with whom she shared the stage had collectively lost 10 elections, while the women hadn't lost a single one.
And besides, she added, she was the only person onstage who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years. Bernie Sanders -- who contributed seven of those losses -- quickly volunteered that he had beaten a Republican incumbent in 1990. Which Warren, despite her career as a primary school teacher, claimed was not within the past 30 years.
Joe Biden didn't point out that he beat a Republican incumbent to win his Senate seat in 1972. This is worth mentioning since some people worry that one of the Democrats' leading candidates seems to kind of be living in the past.
About Joe Biden. This is his third run for president. Who among us could forget 2008, when he came in fifth in Iowa and dropped out? Or 1988, when he -- OK, you did forget 1988. Totally understand.
Biden hasn't had any super disasters in the debates. Well, there was the time in October when he said: "I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5%." And that time in November when he spoke out against violence against women, adding that "we have to just change the culture ... and keep punching at it and punching at it." Details, details.
This last performance was pretty clean and Biden got fairly good reviews, many of which boiled down to how he'd gotten through the evening "without taking major damage."
Can we all agree that no female candidate could ever get away with stuff like that and then win praise for not saying anything stranger?
When it comes to gender bias, in the past Biden agreed that Clinton faced it to an "unfair" degree. Then he added, "That's not going to happen with me."
His campaign later claimed that his statement did not, um, mean what it sort of sounded like it meant.
So, about sexism in politics. Absolutely there, especially at the highest levels. But dissolving rapidly in places where women are proving what terrific vote-getters they are. We have 26 women in the Senate now -- nearly half the all-of-American-history total. Seventeen are Democrats.
This little detail gives us an opportunity to recall the days when the Republican Party was progressive enough to have serious arguments about whether a woman could win the presidency. Remember the glorious Sen. Margaret Chase Smith? She ran for the nomination in 1964, when she was 66. A columnist for the Los Angeles Times argued that she was too old and added that when women hit the ideal age for running in their late 40s or early 50s, they are utterly unfit for office, since they are undergoing the "physical changes and emotional distress" of menopause.
So you have to admit things have been getting better. For women, that is. We've still got Donald Trump. Sorry, nation.

Anti-bribery law in crosshairs?

Texto completo: President Donald Trump wanted to strike down a law that prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials, calling the ban "so unfair" to American companies, two Washington Post reporters recount in a new book.
In the spring of 2017, Trump was at a briefing with Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Trump "perked up" and told Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Trump said it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Trump told Tillerson.
Tillerson explained that he could not repeal the legislation, according to Rucker and Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law.
Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Miller in the hallway, where Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law.
In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company, Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, whom Trump nominated to the position in early 2017.
Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that America's anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017.
And under the current attorney general, William Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."

Texto completo: It was about an hour into Harvey Weinstein's rape trial when his lead defense lawyer came under attack. The prosecutor called a recent media blitz intended to discredit Weinstein's accusers "an abomination" and asked the judge to put an end to it with a gag order. \ But the defense lawyer, Donna Rotunno, lashed back at the prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi.
"Ms. Illuzzi stands in this courtroom and calls my client a predator and then has the nerve to say I shouldn't go out and discuss this case," Rotunno said. "She wants everyone out there to convict Mr. Weinstein before one piece of evidence comes before this court."
Long before an avalanche of allegations against Weinstein set off a global reckoning over sexual harassment, Rotunno was steadily building a career as a criminal lawyer in Chicago with an unusual specialty: defending men accused of sex crimes.
As the #MeToo movement grew, she embraced the role of contrarian, arguing that a public rush to condemn men accused of sexual misconduct and assault was shredding reputations and careers without due process. Even if the movement had helped the feminist cause, she said, it came at too high a price.
"If we have 500 positives that come from a movement, but the one negative is that it strips you of your right to due process and a fair trial, and the presumption of innocence, then to me, not one of those things can outweigh the one bad," she said in an interview. "We can't have movements that strip us of our fundamental rights."
Weinstein, who made no secret of wanting to cast a woman as his courtroom champion, asked Rotunno to lead his defense team in May, after parting ways with two sets of lawyers led by men.
Since then, Rotunno has emerged as a paradoxical and polemical figure, who has decided to defend a man reviled by many women as the embodiment of chauvinism and sexual misconduct.
That has earned her the scorn of some women's rights advocates, who have suggested she may be motivated as much by the recognition and future work the case will bring her as by her legal principles.
"Her willingness to claim that #MeToo has gone too far is attached to a steady stream of big paychecks, but is not supported by the facts," said Jane Manning, an advocate for rape victims and a former New York City sex crimes prosecutor.
While the movement has encouraged women to speak up about sexual assault and has highlighted the failures of law enforcement to hold some men responsible for sexual crimes, in Rotunno's opinion, the cultural pendulum has swung too far. Many of her clients are considered guilty until proven innocent, she said.
While women should never be forced to do things they do not want to do, she said, she thinks they also must bear responsibility for their decisions.
"You can't just have it both ways and say, 'I should be able to do whatever I want without consequences. I should put myself in any situation I want and play victim,' " Rotunno said. "Having voluntary sex with someone even if it is a begrudging act is not a crime after the fact."
She added: "What happens with #BelieveAllWomen is that we're just supposed to believe you without any pushback, or questioning, or cross-examination. I think that's dangerous."
Rotunno grew up in the Chicago suburbs, the granddaughter of a police officer and the daughter of a businessman in the grocery industry and a teacher.
Even as a child, Rotunno became fascinated with practicing law while watching the television series "The Paper Chase," which was about a first-year Harvard Law School student.
She went to a local Catholic college, graduated from the Chicago-Kent College of Law, then landed a job as a clerk with the Cook County state's attorney's office in 1997. Three years later, she became an assistant state's attorney in Illinois, working on domestic violence cases and felony crimes.
By 2003, she had gone into private practice with a defense lawyer, and two years later, at age 29, she started her own firm.
"She decided to do something a lot of women don't do," said David Erickson, a retired judge who had once been her supervisor in the state's attorney's office. "Strike out on her own."
In Chicago, she became known for her personal style and for winning criminal trials and specializing in sex crimes.
Rotunno, who describes herself as "a reasonable-minded independent," said she finds it disheartening that the #MeToo movement has affected routine exchanges between men and women.
"It's sad," she said, "that men have to worry about being complimentary and pleasant to women."
When it comes to sex crimes cases, Rotunno has lost only once at trial. She keeps a courtroom sketch from that case taped to a wall in her office.
Her client Demarco Whitley, then 19, a former high school football player, was convicted of raping a 15-year-old girl and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Rotunno believes the "real perpetrator" was Whitley's cousin, who was also accused of participating in the attack but who died in a car crash before trial. Her client, she said, was "the follower."
She put the teenage girl through a brutal cross-examination, because "her story was not great." Afterward, she asked the prosecutor to pass a message on to the girl: "Tell her I had a job to do. I don't want this to define what happens to her."
Rotunno's skill at undermining accusers on the witness stand will be put to the test in the Weinstein trial.
The Manhattan District Attorney's Office plans to call six women to testify about their allegations that Weinstein sexually assaulted them, though many of those incidents are too old to be charged as separate crimes.
The prosecution's case hinges almost entirely on the jury believing the women's accounts, since there is little or no physical evidence. Weinstein is charged with raping one woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and forcing oral sex on a second woman in his apartment in 2006. The other women will be called to show a pattern of behavior.
As a woman, Rotunno anticipates that she can take a harder line against Weinstein's accusers without looking like a bully. Jurors, she said, will simply see two women having a conversation.
Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents two of Weinstein's accusers, disagreed.
"A bully is a bully, regardless of their gender," Allred said. "I don't believe it is appropriate to go after a victim on the stand with venom."

Texto completo: Yes, a woman can be elected president of the United States.
It's time to put that nonissue behind us.
One nearly was, and it wasn't her gender that dealt her a loss.
As Bernie Sanders pointed out in the Democratic debate in Iowa Tuesday night, "Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes."
Everywhere else, that would have been enough.
Regrettably, the United States is burdened with an anachronism called the Electoral College, reflecting the mistrust of small states for large ones. A system crafted to elect George Washington most recently served up someone most unlike him.
Just 77,000 more votes in three key states made the difference between a President Clinton and a President Trump four years ago; between having a First Man or a First Lady in the White House.
That was so close, it could have been Russia's meddling that made the difference. Or James Comey's October surprise. Or Clinton's failure to campaign in three normally safe states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - that she had lost to Sanders in the Democratic primaries.
It used to be said that a Roman Catholic couldn't be elected president. Then John F. Kennedy was.
Divorce was assumed to be a disqualification. Ronald Reagan disproved that.
Race was the next frontier. Then Barack Obama was elected.
In the current campaign, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is a formidable contender. She'd be even stronger if she weren't contending with Sanders for the same voters. She scored points in the Des Moines debate by observing, truthfully, that the men on the stage had collectively lost 10 elections while she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were undefeated.
That Klobuchar remains in a dwindling field reflects her potential as the moderate alternative to Sanders or Warren if Joe Biden doesn't do well in the early caucus and primary states. There is no question that either of those women is a qualified rival to Trump and would make a far superior president.
Male machismo and misogyny - the only reasons for even asking whether a woman could be president - are hardly unique to the United States. Yet 59 other nations, spanning the globe and every region and ethnicity, have had women as heads of government. Why hasn't it happened here?
One reason is that it took time to break the glass ceilings in Congress, state capitals and the vice presidency, which are the traditional proving grounds for presidential prospects.
Since women were enfranchised 101 years ago, only five Democratic women and two Republicans have attained enough political exposure and stature to be taken seriously as candidates in the two major parties. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was the first, opposing Barry Goldwater for the 1964 GOP nomination. Clinton gave Obama strong competition in 2008 before winning the nomination eight years later.
But only two women have been chosen as running mates, and both tickets lost - Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and John McCain and Sarah Palin in 2008.
Another reason is that many of those other nations, notably Great Britain and Israel, are parliamentary democracies that do not directly elect their heads of government. Their prime ministers have generally come up through party ranks, showcasing their talents. In our nation's infancy, it was the party caucuses in Congress that nominated presidential candidates.
The Democratic debates should have put to rest the gender issue. As New York Times columnist Frank Bruni observed, pointed questions could also be raised over age - Biden is 77 and Sanders is 78 - and over Pete Buttigieg's identity as a gay man who has a male spouse.
"Doesn't that make them risky nominees in their own ways?" Bruni wrote. "If Warren and Klobuchar were less polite and restrained, they might have said so last night. Instead they just turned in debate performances that showed just how commanding women are."
It was CNN, rather than any of the candidates, that performed the worst in the debate. That distinction owes to one of the moderators, Abby Phillip, who in effect called Sanders a liar after he denied Warren's claim that he had told her a woman couldn't be elected president.
Turning to Warren, Phillip asked her, "What did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?"
It was a loaded question that Sanders didn't get a chance to rebut. Poynter Institute media critic Tom Jones rightly called it "stunning in its ineptitude, stunning in its unprofessionalism."
Warren was clearly uncomfortable. "I disagreed," she said, and sought to change the subject.
So, can a woman be elected president?
Yes.
So can a man.
There is no material difference.
What really matters is who are qualified, competent and trustworthy.

Anti-bribery law in crosshairs? New book alleges Trump sought to kill ban on US companies

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump wanted to strike down a law that prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials, calling the ban "so unfair" to American companies, two Washington Post reporters recount in a new book.
In the spring of 2017, Trump was at a briefing with Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Trump "perked up" and told Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Trump said it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Trump told Tillerson.
Tillerson explained that he could not repeal the legislation, according to Rucker and Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law.
Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Miller in the hallway, where Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law.
In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company, Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, whom Trump nominated to the position in early 2017.
Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that America's anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017.
And under the current attorney general, William Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."

Ukraine opens probe into surveillance of ambassador; FBI visits Hyde's home

Texto completo: As Ukrainian police Thursday announced an investigation into the possibility that the U.S. ambassador came under illegal surveillance by an unknown party before she was recalled from her post in May, FBI agents visited the Simsbury home of Robert F. Hyde, a longshot Republican congressional candidate who was tied to the alleged surveillance in new documents released this week.
A law enforcement source confirmed to the Courant that the FBI had been at Hyde's home in the Weatogue section of town. One of Hyde's neighbors told NBC News that an agent arrived at his home before dawn. The neighbor said they did not believe the agent entered Hyde's home and left by 10:30 a.m. When a Courant reporter went to Hyde's home around 11 a.m. there was no response at the door and no sign that he was home. Two cars were parked in the driveway - a Hummer and a vintage Cadillac.
The announcement of the Ukrainian investigation and the FBI's visit to Hyde's home came two days after House Democrats released a trove of documents that showed Lev Parnas, an associate of President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, communicating about the removal of Marie Yovanovitch with Hyde.
The Ukrainian Interior Ministry, which runs the police forces, said in a statement that Ukrainian police "are not interfering in the internal political affairs of the United States."
"However, the published messages contain facts of possible violations of Ukrainian law and of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations, which protect the rights of diplomats on the territory of another state," the statement continued.
"Our goal is to investigate whether there actually was a violation of Ukrainian and international law, which could be the subject for proper reaction. Or whether it is just bravado and fake information in the informal conversation between two U.S. citizens," the ministry said.
The State Department has not commented on whether they will open an investigation into the alleged surveillance of Yovanovitch, a key figure in the impeachment inquiry into Trump.
A House Foreign Affairs Committee staff member said that the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, whose agents protect diplomats and investigate certain crimes, had told the committee that it would immediately open an investigation, according to The New York Times.
One former diplomat criticized the State Department's decision to stay silent.
"This has to be a first in American history," Nick Burns, who rose to become the third-ranking official at the State Department before his retirement, wrote on Twitter. "A foreign government rushing to the defense of a senior U.S. career ambassador to defend her from people deputized by the President of the United States. And the Secretary of State refuses to say one word in her defense."
Hyde, a 40-year-old former Marine, emerged as an unlikely figure in the new documents sent by House Democrats to the Senate this week in advance of Trump's impeachment trial.
The documents included a series of menacing text exchanges between Hyde and Parnas in which Hyde seemed to relay updates about the location of Yovanovitch.
The Interior Ministry also said it has requested the FBI provide relevant materials. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov "suggested that the U.S. side take part in the investigation," the statement said.
It is unclear how Hyde might have the ability - if any - to track the movements of Yovanovitch. In prolific Twitter posts, Hyde often features pictures posing with well-known figures, including Trump, Giuliani, Parnas, and other conservatives.
In a phone interview on "America This Week w/ Eric Bolling," a one-hour interview program that airs on television stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, Hyde downplayed the texts.
He said he barely knows Parnas. The two were exchanging "colorful" messages "while we're having a few pops, smoking a couple of cigars somewhere out in the world," Hyde siad.
"I thought we were playing," he told Bolling. "I didn't know he was so serious."
At one point, Bolling asked Hyde if he was tracking Yovanovitch.
"Absolutely not," Hyde responded. "Are you kiddng me? I'm a little landscaper from [expletive] Connecticut, excuse my language."
Parnas, in an interview Wednesday night with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, said he never took Hyde seriously.
"He's a weird character," Parnas told Maddow.
Hyde was a fixture at the bar at one of Trump's hotels. "I've never seen him not drunk," Parnas added.
Parnas said he initially did not believe that Hyde's messages constituted a threat to Yovanovitch.
"I think he was either drunk or trying to make himself bigger than [he] was so I didn't take him seriously ... I didn't even respond to him most of the time ... eventually you can see I cut him off."
The messages from Hyde to Parnas seem to reflect an attempt to track Yovanovitch's movements.
"She's talked to three people. Her phone is off. Computer is off," Hyde apparently wrote Parnas on March 25, 2019, followed within seconds by "She's next to the embassy" and "Not in the embassy."
"They will let me know when she's on the move," he messaged Parnas a few minutes later.
The Democratic chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs has called for an investigation into the "profoundly alarming" messages between Hyde and Parnas.
Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., said the texts suggest an "unprecedented threat to our diplomats."

Texto completo: The white living room in Olusanya Ojikutu's home, with its soaring cathedral ceiling, is a temple to his traditional and contemporary African art. Sculptures bookend the sofa, paintings and prints decorate the walls, and the overall atmosphere is one of beauty, historic grandeur and repose.
Most of Ojikutu's sculptures are at least a century old, created for performances or rituals. "They served as intermediaries between the local people and their ancestors' spirits to make their lives better and protect them from evil forces in this world and beyond," he said.
Among the dozens of sculptures are a metal Kota reliquary guardian figure from Gabon, a wood Bamana Chi Wara headdress from Mali and a wood-fiber Bwa plank mask from Burkina Faso.
"African art has long been seen as a monolith, but it really has many different origins," said Ojikutu, who is also an artist. "It should be recognized as more nuanced and coming from the many countries on the continent. I try to show that expanse of art forms and visual cultures in my collection."
Ojikutu, 50, of Nigeria, immigrated to the United States in the mid-1990s. He and his wife, Yinka, both work in technology and live with their two teenage sons in a Washington suburb.
These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Q: Why is it important to have connections to the art you collect?
The connection I feel toward any piece I buy, own or display is almost always love at first sight. Typically it's a numinous experience; the work speaks to me. I feel this instant visual attraction followed by an unconscious burst of inspiration.
Ile-Ife (Nigeria), where I went to university, is considered the ancestral home of the Yoruba and the legendary birthplace of the gods and humankind, so I have a natural connection to Yoruba history, art and culture because it's my personal history.
I also feel a connection when I buy artists I know. Like Victor Ehikhamenor, who happens to be my friend. I bought "No Man Is an Island" (2018). If you look closely, you see small black figures and faces embedded in the large silhouette. The paradigm he presents viewers is, "There are people within you and behind you and in front of you." It's all about connections.

Q: The timespan between early African art and contemporary art is wide. Do artists today appreciate traditional African art?
Certainly I believe a handful do care about, study and are somewhat influenced by African art, particularly masks. And I feel I'm following in the footsteps of artists like Gauguin, Picasso, Modigliani, Klee, Matisse and, more recently, Bacon and Basquiat, who were emotionally connected to and influenced by traditional African art.

Q: Was there a trigger moment to your collecting?
I think there were two.
A long time ago, an artist friend, Dapo Ojoade, wanted me to look at a colorfully painted flat wood sculpture he made. So I went to his house and said, "I love it. I want it." That was the first catalyst.
Then in 2016, I attended the auction of the art estate of Merton D. Simpson. He was the most prominent African American dealer of African art and he was a painter himself. I thought, "I want to do what he has done."

This yellow painting is redolent of El Anatsui.
It is by El Anatsui, painted in the 1980s. The adinkra motifs are considered a precursor to his majestic tapestries.

The crown on this caryatid resembles the African American museum on the National Mall.
The crown's shape was the inspiration for David Adjaye's design of the museum.
I have a profound connection to the museum because I participated in the Middle Passage exhibit. The exhibitors wanted a mix of authentic voices to reenact the anguish and suffering of slaves crossing the Atlantic. I contributed the Yoruba voice.

Q: How do you share your collection?
Yinka and I organize a yearly salon in a Gertrude Stein kind of way in the lower level of our house. That's where our photo collection is - pictures by Andrew Dosunmu, Zak Ové, George Osodi, Barthélémy Toguo, J.D. 'Okhai Ojeikere - many of my paintings and Nok terra cotta, a fragile fired-clay sculpture from sometime between 500 B.C. to 200 A.D.
We invite people over to talk about art. We make sure you feel comfortable and that when you leave you see African art as beautiful and as conversation pieces that inspire thoughtful concentration to be fully appreciated.

In US talks, Taliban offer to curb violence in Afghanistan

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction - though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days - and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire - in which no attacks are carried out - without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Texto completo: LONDON - The governments of five countries that lost citizens when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner demanded Thursday that Tehran accept "full responsibility" and pay compensation to the victims' families - though they had little to offer besides moral pressure to get Iran to comply.
After a meeting in London, foreign ministers from Canada, the U.K., Afghanistan, Sweden and Ukraine urged Iran to allow a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation," as well as a criminal probe and "impartial" judicial proceedings against those found responsible for downing the plane.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft died when it was brought down by ballistic missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Jan. 8.
The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens, as well as Iranians.
Before the meeting at the Canadian High Commission, ministers from the five nations lit candles at a vigil in memory of the dead passengers and crew members.
Iran initially blamed a technical fault for the plane crash, before acknowledging in the face of mounting evidence that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard had accidentally brought down the jetliner.
In keeping with international norms, Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, the United States and France to take part in the crash investigation. But it's unclear whether Iran will share all key details or give the countries full access.
FBI plans to notify states about election breaches at local level
WASHINGTON - The FBI, in a change of policy, is committing to inform state officials if local election systems have been breached, federal officials said Thursday.
In the past, the FBI would alert local governments about attacks on their electoral systems without automatically sharing that information with the state. That meant state officials, left in the dark, might be in a position of certifying the accuracy of election results without realizing there had been problems in individual counties. Alerting local governments about breaches, but not the states, was in keeping with FBI policy of protecting the privacy and identities of actual hacking victims.
Now, though, the FBI will notify both counties victimized by breaches as well as the state's chief election official, and the notification is to be done in person.
Guatemala sweeps up migrants, returns them to the border
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala - Guatemalan police accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up the majority of a group of about 300 migrants Thursday, loaded them on buses and took them back to the Honduran border, effectively dashing their plans to travel together in a "caravan" with hopes of reaching the United States.
Praying and singing songs, the group of adults, teens and young children had set out from a shelter in Entre Rios under rainy skies before dawn and walked about six hours before stopping in the town of Morales to eat and rest.
There they were challenged by police who asked for their entry documents, and nearly all had crossed into Guatemala irregularly and didn't have such documentation.
Prince Harry takes on first duties since royal crisis talks
LONDON - Prince Harry went back to work Thursday, mixing with children playing rugby and offering no hint of the days of turmoil that followed his recent announcement that he wished to step back from royal duties and become financially independent.
It was a fairly standard event for Harry, who watched as children from a local school offer a rugby demonstration on the Buckingham Palace grounds. It marked the first time Harry had taken on a public engagement since announcing last week that he and his wife, Meghan, needed a change.
He joked with the kids and shook hands, but ignored a journalist's question about his future.
Queen Elizabeth II brokered a deal Monday for "a period of transition" to sort out how to be a part-time royal.
Iran's president says 'no limit' to nuke enrichment
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that there is "no limit" to the country's enrichment of uranium after its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general by the U.S.
In a speech, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a "better situation" than it was before the agreement with world powers.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018 and has since imposed "maximum" sanctions on Iran's economy.
Iran abided by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. After the Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.
Pope names 1st woman manager in top office
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has tapped an Italian lawyer to be the first woman to hold a management position in the Vatican's most important office, the Secretariat of State.
Francis named Francesca Di Giovanni, a 27-year veteran of the Vatican, as undersecretary for multilateral affairs. She will be responsible for running a division that coordinates the Holy See's relations with the U.N. and other intergovernmental organizations.
Francis has called for women in decision-making roles in the Vatican and Catholic Church at large, though none heads a Vatican congregation or other key office, positions reserved for priests, bishops or cardinals.
Di Giovanni, 66, told the Vatican's in-house media that Francis' appointment Wednesday showed his attention to women.
In Oregon: A teenager who was taken out of state by her mother to avoid surgery for a rare type of liver cancer has had the operation after state welfare officials took her into custody, several Portland, Oregon, TV outlets reported Thursday.
Kylee Dixon, 13, was recovering in an intensive care unit after surgery Tuesday to remove liver tumors.
The Dixons traveled to Las Vegas in June after prosecutors say Christine Dixon refused to turn her daughter over to the state for the surgery. Christine Dixon has said months of chemotherapy debilitated her daughter and that she did much better on CBD oil, a non-psychoactive compound extracted from cannabis plants and other alternative therapies.

The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Texto completo: LONDON - The governments of five countries that lost citizens when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner demanded Thursday that Tehran accept "full responsibility" and pay compensation to the victims' families - though they had little to offer besides moral pressure to get Iran to comply.
After a meeting in London, foreign ministers from Canada, the U.K., Afghanistan, Sweden and Ukraine urged Iran to allow a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation," as well as a criminal probe and "impartial" judicial proceedings against those found responsible for downing the plane.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft died when it was brought down by ballistic missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Jan. 8.
The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens, as well as Iranians.
Before the meeting at the Canadian High Commission, ministers from the five nations lit candles at a vigil in memory of the dead passengers and crew members.
Iran initially blamed a technical fault for the plane crash, before acknowledging in the face of mounting evidence that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard had accidentally brought down the jetliner.
In keeping with international norms, Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, the United States and France to take part in the crash investigation. But it's unclear whether Iran will share all key details or give the countries full access.

FBI plans to notify states about election breaches at local level
WASHINGTON - The FBI, in a change of policy, is committing to inform state officials if local election systems have been breached, federal officials said Thursday.
In the past, the FBI would alert local governments about attacks on their electoral systems without automatically sharing that information with the state. That meant state officials, left in the dark, might be in a position of certifying the accuracy of election results without realizing there had been problems in individual counties. Alerting local governments about breaches, but not the states, was in keeping with FBI policy of protecting the privacy and identities of actual hacking victims.
Now, though, the FBI will notify both counties victimized by breaches as well as the state's chief election official, and the notification is to be done in person.

Guatemala sweeps up migrants, returns them to the border
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala - Guatemalan police accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up the majority of a group of about 300 migrants Thursday, loaded them on buses and took them back to the Honduran border, effectively dashing their plans to travel together in a "caravan" with hopes of reaching the United States.
Praying and singing songs, the group of adults, teens and young children had set out from a shelter in Entre Rios under rainy skies before dawn and walked about six hours before stopping in the town of Morales to eat and rest.
There they were challenged by police who asked for their entry documents, and nearly all had crossed into Guatemala irregularly and didn't have such documentation.

Prince Harry takes on first duties since royal crisis talks
LONDON - Prince Harry went back to work Thursday, mixing with children playing rugby and offering no hint of the days of turmoil that followed his recent announcement that he wished to step back from royal duties and become financially independent.
It was a fairly standard event for Harry, who watched as children from a local school offer a rugby demonstration on the Buckingham Palace grounds. It marked the first time Harry had taken on a public engagement since announcing last week that he and his wife, Meghan, needed a change.
He joked with the kids and shook hands, but ignored a journalist's question about his future.
Queen Elizabeth II brokered a deal Monday for "a period of transition" to sort out how to be a part-time royal.

Iran's president says 'no
limit' to nuke enrichment
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that there is "no limit" to the country's enrichment of uranium after its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general by the U.S.
In a speech, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a "better situation" than it was before the agreement with world powers.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018 and has since imposed "maximum" sanctions on Iran's economy.
Iran abided by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. After the Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.

Pope names 1st woman
manager in top office
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has tapped an Italian lawyer to be the first woman to hold a management position in the Vatican's most important office, the Secretariat of State.
Francis named Francesca Di Giovanni, a 27-year veteran of the Vatican, as undersecretary for multilateral affairs. She will be responsible for running a division that coordinates the Holy See's relations with the U.N. and other intergovernmental organizations.
Francis has called for women in decision-making roles in the Vatican and Catholic Church at large, though none heads a Vatican congregation or other key office, positions reserved for priests, bishops or cardinals.
Di Giovanni, 66, told the Vatican's in-house media that Francis' appointment Wednesday showed his attention to women.

Texto completo: RICHMOND - A Richmond judge rejected a bid by gun-rights groups and residents Thursday to block Gov. Ralph Northam's temporary ban on guns in Capitol Square.
The temporary injunction request, filed in Richmond Circuit Court, said Northam doesn't have the authority to issue such a ban, and that the ban violates Second Amendment rights and possibly the First Amendment.
But shortly after a hearing, Judge Joi Taylor denied the request, saying the governor has the authority to issue such an order under a state emergency services law and that the court should show deference to the executive on the issue.
Taylor wrote that the governor has the authority to enact the ban because he oversees the Department of General Services, an executive branch agency that controls Capitol Square. She cited a state code section that said he also had the authority to take "action from time to time" during emergencies to ensure safety.
On Wednesday, Northam announced the ban and state of emergency - which goes into effect today and ends Tuesday - saying intelligence officials had heard credible threats of violence expected Monday, when the Virginia Citizens Defense League holds its annual lobby day and rally to protect gun rights.
"This is the right decision," Northam said in a statement Thursday after the judge issued her ruling.
Gun Owners of America, the Virginia Citizens Defense League and three Fairfax residents who are concealed carry permit holders and say the ban would violate their rights filed the injunction request.
Philip Van Cleave, who heads the VCDL, told The Virginian-Pilot Thursday night his organization has appealed the judge's ruling. Friday and Monday are state holidays, and courts will be closed, but Van Cleave said he thinks an emergency appeal in the Supreme Court of Virginia could still be considered Friday.
In the injunction, lawyers for the groups argued Northam's underlying message with his temporary ban was to provoke and challenge gun owners, and referred to the governor's mentions of credible threats as "vague" and "unspecific."
"Perhaps the governor is fearful that some Virginians might be 'extremely' in favor of preserving their constitutional rights," they wrote. "However so far as plaintiffs are aware, 'extremism' in support of constitutional rights is no crime, and present no danger to anyone."
David Browne, the lawyer arguing for the injunction an hour after it was filed Thursday, said carrying a gun was a form of speech, and that people had a "right to peacefully assemble in the manner they see fit."
He said if people aren't allowed in the Capitol grounds that will be fenced off for the annual rally, they will inevitably make their way into the closed-off streets, furthering the risk of danger.
Toby Heytens, the state's solicitor general, pointed to the credible threats of violence Northam said police received, and said the temporary ban was a way to prevent another event like Charlottesville, where in 2017 violence erupted from hate groups and a woman was killed.
He cited a New York Times article published Thursday that reported FBI officials arrested three suspected members of a neo-Nazi hate group amid allegations they planned to travel to the rally Monday.
Heytens argued the ban didn't prevent anyone from assembling, speaking or petitioning their government, and argued simply carrying a gun isn't considered free speech.
"This is not another Charlottesville," Browne responded. "This is a completely different group of people."
Browne cited a 2012 law that says the governor can't prohibit people from having guns, except to ensure public safety in an emergency shelter or "for the purpose of sheltering persons."
But Northam's executive order says that by declaring a state of emergency, he's providing shelter to state employees and visitors, therefore the ban is legitimate.
While the hearing was going on Thursday, the Senate narrowly passed three of Northam's proposed gun control measures: universal background checks on gun sales, allowing localities to regulate firearms in government buildings and parks, and limiting handgun sales to one a month.
In a joint statement Thursday afternoon, Senate and House Republicans said they asked Northam for the General Assembly leadership to be briefed in a secure location on the threats of violence intelligence officials had received.
"Considering the abridgment of the constitutional rights of Virginians your declaration has imposed, and because we have serious concerns about whether a governor has the authority to enact such restrictions, we believe it is imperative that leaders of the General Assembly - representing both majority and minority caucuses - are appropriately briefed as to the nature of these threats," GOP leaders wrote.

Violence, art and social media Olivia Gatwood, poet with a YouTube following, uses words to turn tables on fear and obsession

Texto completo: If Olivia Gatwood had never found poetry, she would probably be dead by now. She said this nonchalantly backstage before a performance at Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg for several hundred fans.
A few minutes later, she was slathering lavender oil on her tattooed arms. "I don't like perfume," she said. "It makes me feel like a dead lady - like I'm being embalmed."
Despite all the death talk and the fact that her latest collection of poetry, "Life of the Party," revolves around violence against women, Gatwood, 27, is easygoing and effervescent (not to mention resourceful - backstage, she turned avocados into impromptu guacamole with little more than a wine key and a coffee stirrer).
She recently finished her tour across the United States with singer Ari Chi and cellist Cailin Nolte. Gatwood plans and funds her own tours and often handles the transportation herself, driving a 10-passenger van from city to city.
Gatwood started performing poetry in high school; soon after graduating, she was part of Brave New Voices, a poetry festival that has been featured on HBO. But many of her fans found her through YouTube, where she has cultivated a mostly female audience with performances of poems such as "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" and "Ode to My Bitch Face" that have garnered hundreds of thousands of views. A children's book she wrote with Mahogany L. Browne and Elizabeth Acevedo, "Woke: A Young Poet's Call to Justice," is scheduled for release in March.
Gatwood grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city with more than its share of violence (its metro area had one of the United States' highest murder rates in 2018). The city's struggles, she said, affected her from a young age. In her poem "BODY COUNT: 13," she describes the West Mesa murders, an unsolved case involving the disappearance and murder of 11 women and a fetus whose remains were found on the outskirts of Albuquerque a decade after they were buried. She was 17 when the bodies were discovered.
Her parents, whom she described as hippies, never set a curfew and didn't always shield her from life. Her mother was a sex educator before becoming an HIV epidemiologist - Gatwood remembers having a stuffed animal in the shape of the chlamydia virus and knowing about HIV when she was 5 - and her father, who according to Gatwood resembles Ted Bundy, was a middle-school teacher from whom she inherited her emotional nature.
Her father, Byron Gatwood, said she was fixated on language early on. "She was very interested always in the dynamics of relationships, the idea of how people get along and what the rules are, whether they're written or not," he said.
"Life of the Party" is largely a memoir, with memories of friendship as well as violence. In "Mans/Laughter," Gatwood shares, among other things, the sexual harassment she endured from her boss while working at a bakery in high school. Her book doesn't mention that as a 15-year-old, she organized other women who had been victimized and reported the bakery to the EEOC. She eventually received a settlement of more than $10,000.
"I encouraged her not to. I said they're not going to do anything about it. And she, she plowed ahead totally on her own," her mother, Jill Gatwood, said. "I thought it was good that she was standing up for herself."
"Life of the Party" is also a meditation on Olivia Gatwood's obsession with the true crime genre and her long-running fear of male violence. "I've always been really afraid of men," she said. "I think that's really rational for a young girl to feel that way."
Living in a ground-floor apartment in Boston prompted much of the work in the book. In an author's note that details her many sleepless nights, she writes: "I was afraid of something very specific: a man climbing through my first-floor apartment window, which realistically could have been popped open with a butter knife, and strangling me in my bed." After she finished writing it, she said, she slept her first full night by herself.
Melissa Lozada-Oliva, a poet who hosts the podcast "Say More" with Gatwood and who said they first bonded over the gaps in their front teeth, said that she knew Gatwood struggled with the book. That was partly because Gatwood sought in her writing to address "her privilege as a white woman - acknowledging who gets to talk about violence and who gets to talk about violence being inflicted on them," Lozada-Oliva said.
During the Brooklyn performance, Gatwood was greeted with roaring applause when she read "Ode to My Bitch Face," which is just what it sounds like, and "Ode to the Women of Long Island" ("who / when I show them the knife I carry in my purse / tell me it's not big enough"). Afterward, she spent more than an hour signing books and getting to know some of the teenage girls and young women who came.
Mary Cornwell and Abigail Buchholz, a mother and daughter who drove five hours from Virginia, were among them. Buchholz first discovered Gatwood's work on YouTube and shared it with Cornwell, who said the poems resonated with her as both a woman and a mother. "It's beautiful and relevant to all generations," she said.
At the beginning of Gatwood's writing career, she wanted her audience to be "misogynistic men on the internet," the people who perhaps needed to hear her work the most.
After many death and rape threats, she shifted her focus.
"It's less important to me to change the minds of the people who want me dead," Gatwood said. "And more important that I make girls feel less alone."

In US talks, Taliban offer to curb violence in Afghanistan

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction - though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days - and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire - in which no attacks are carried out - without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction - though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days - and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire - in which no attacks are carried out - without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Texto completo: Nations of Iran crash victims seek compensation for families
LONDON - The governments of five countries that lost citizens when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner demanded Thursday that Tehran accept "full responsibility" and pay compensation to the victims' families - though they had little to offer besides moral pressure to get Iran to comply.
After a meeting in London, foreign ministers from Canada, the U.K., Afghanistan, Sweden and Ukraine urged Iran to allow a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation," as well as a criminal probe and "impartial" judicial proceedings against those found responsible for downing the plane.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft died when it was brought down by ballistic missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Jan. 8.
The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens, as well as Iranians.
Before the meeting at the Canadian High Commission, ministers from the five nations lit candles at a vigil in memory of the dead passengers and crew members.
Iran initially blamed a technical fault for the plane crash, before acknowledging in the face of mounting evidence that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard had accidentally brought down the jetliner.
In keeping with international norms, Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, the United States and France to take part in the crash investigation. But it's unclear whether Iran will share all key details or give the countries full access.

FBI plans to notify states about election breaches at local level
WASHINGTON - The FBI, in a change of policy, is committing to inform state officials if local election systems have been breached, federal officials said Thursday.
In the past, the FBI would alert local governments about attacks on their electoral systems without automatically sharing that information with the state. That meant state officials, left in the dark, might be in a position of certifying the accuracy of election results without realizing there had been problems in individual counties. Alerting local governments about breaches, but not the states, was in keeping with FBI policy of protecting the privacy and identities of actual hacking victims.
Now, though, the FBI will notify both counties victimized by breaches as well as the state's chief election official, and the notification is to be done in person.

Guatemala sweeps up migrants, returns them to the border
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala - Guatemalan police accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up the majority of a group of about 300 migrants Thursday, loaded them on buses and took them back to the Honduran border, effectively dashing their plans to travel together in a "caravan" with hopes of reaching the United States.
Praying and singing songs, the group of adults, teens and young children had set out from a shelter in Entre Rios under rainy skies before dawn and walked about six hours before stopping in the town of Morales to eat and rest.
There they were challenged by police who asked for their entry documents, and nearly all had crossed into Guatemala irregularly and didn't have such documentation.

Prince Harry takes on first duties since royal crisis talks
LONDON - Prince Harry went back to work Thursday, mixing with children playing rugby and offering no hint of the days of turmoil that followed his recent announcement that he wished to step back from royal duties and become financially independent.
It was a fairly standard event for Harry, who watched as children from a local school offer a rugby demonstration on the Buckingham Palace grounds. It marked the first time Harry had taken on a public engagement since announcing last week that he and his wife, Meghan, needed a change.
He joked with the kids and shook hands, but ignored a journalist's question about his future.
Queen Elizabeth II brokered a deal Monday for "a period of transition" to sort out how to be a part-time royal.

Iran's president says 'no limit' to nuke enrichment
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that there is "no limit" to the country's enrichment of uranium after its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general by the U.S.
In a speech, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a "better situation" than it was before the agreement with world powers.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018 and has since imposed "maximum" sanctions on Iran's economy.
Iran abided by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. After the Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.

Pope names 1st woman manager in top office
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has tapped an Italian lawyer to be the first woman to hold a management position in the Vatican's most important office, the Secretariat of State.
Francis named Francesca Di Giovanni, a 27-year veteran of the Vatican, as undersecretary for multilateral affairs. She will be responsible for running a division that coordinates the Holy See's relations with the U.N. and other intergovernmental organizations.
Francis has called for women in decision-making roles in the Vatican and Catholic Church at large, though none heads a Vatican congregation or other key office, positions reserved for priests, bishops or cardinals.
Di Giovanni, 66, told the Vatican's in-house media that Francis' appointment Wednesday showed his attention to women.

In Oregon: A teenager who was taken out of state by her mother to avoid surgery for a rare type of liver cancer has had the operation after state welfare officials took her into custody, several Portland, Oregon, TV outlets reported Thursday.
Kylee Dixon, 13, was recovering in an intensive care unit after surgery Tuesday to remove liver tumors.
The Dixons traveled to Las Vegas in June after prosecutors say Christine Dixon refused to turn her daughter over to the state for the surgery. Christine Dixon has said months of chemotherapy debilitated her daughter and that she did much better on CBD oil, a non-psychoactive compound extracted from cannabis plants and other alternative therapies.

Texto completo: The FBI has arrested three suspected members of a neo-Nazi hate group amid allegations they planned to travel to a pro-gun rally next week in Richmond with a homemade machine gun.
A day before their arrests, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency and announced a temporary ban on weapons on the grounds of the Capitol. Northam said he'd received intelligence of "credible, serious threats" of violence, including extremist rhetoric mirroring what was seen before the 2017 white supremacist and neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville.
The men were taken into custody Thursday morning as part of a long-running investigation into the group, known as The Base, as first reported by The New York Times.
Patrik Mathews, a former combat engineer in the Canadian Army Reserve; Brian Lemley Jr., a former cavalry scout in the U.S. Army; and William Bilbrough IV appeared Thursday afternoon in a Maryland federal court on various gun and immigration charges. They will return to court on Wednesday for detention hearings.
Mathews, 27, is a recruiter for the group. He was dismissed from the Canadian Army after his ties to white supremacists surfaced last year.
He entered the United States illegally from Canada through Minnesota around Aug. 19, according to federal court records. On August 30, Lemley and Bilbrough drove from Maryland to pick up Mathews in Michigan, the court documents said. They returned to Maryland together.
The Winnipeg Free Press reported in August at least two investigations were underway into Mathews' "extremist activity." One was being conducted by the armed forces and the other by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The investigations stemmed from a Free Press report that identified Mathews, then a master corporal with the reserves, was behind a recent recruitment drive in Winnipeg for The Base.
The Base has become a growing concern for the FBI, The Times reported. It encourages anarchy by sowing social unrest and political tension in a movement called "accelerationism," according to the Counter Extremism Project, a group that tracks far-right extremists.
The FBI has discovered that members of the Base have used encrypted chat rooms to discuss "recruitment, creating a white ethno-state, committing acts of violence against minority communities (including African-Americans and Jewish-Americans), the organization's military-style training camps, and ways to make improvised explosive devices," according to the criminal complaint.
During Thursday's court hearing, a prosecutor showed a photo of Bilbrough firing guns at a "military-style training camp" in August.
FBI agents have been tracking the three men for several months and have gathered audio and video surveillance. FBI Special Agent Rachid Harrison laid out the evidence against the men in an affidavit unsealed today in U.S. District Court of Maryland.
Here's what law enforcement discovered:
In November, Lemley, 33, and Mathews moved into an apartment in Newark, Delaware. By December, the men used firearm parts to make an assault rifle.
On Dec. 21, Bilbrough, 19, of Denton, Maryland, visited Lemley and Mathews in Delaware. They attempted to make DMT, an illegal hallucinogenic. They discussed The Base's activities and Mathews showed Bilbrough the assault rifle. On New Year's Day, Lemley and Mathews purchased 150 rounds of ammunition and paper targets.
They went to a gun range in Maryland the next day. Afterward, Mathews said the gun fired more than one round at a time.
Lemley said, "Oh oops, it looks like I accidentally made a machine gun."
He then asked Mathews to take off the lower receiver of the gun so he could stow it away until next week, "just in case the ATF shows up tomorrow."
Mathews replied, "if they show up here, we got other problems."
The men visited a gun range in Maryland three times in January.
On Jan. 11, Lemley ordered about 1,500 more rounds of ammunition. Lemley and Mathews picked up at least some of the bullets as well as plate carriers to support body armor from Lemley's prior residence in Maryland.
Federal law enforcement officials took action to apprehended the men after that.
Monday's rally in Richmond is expected to draw tens of thousands of demonstrators to protest proposed restrictions on gun purchases in the state. Philip Van Cleave, who heads the Citizens Defense League, said he's expecting 50,000 to 120,000 people, including out-of-state groups not associated with his organization. Northam said he expects militia and hate groups will descend on the Capitol on Monday intending to becoming violent.

Remembering a tragedy Saturday marks 60 years since the worst commercial airline crash in Virginia's history

Texto completo: Correction: Published correction ran Saturday, January 18, 2019.
Correction: In the Friday editorial "Remembering a tragedy, 60 years on," the airline was incorrectly identified. Flight 20, which crashed in Charles City County on Jan. 18, 1960, was operated by Capital Airlines. (Text corrected.)
Capital Airlines Flight 20 had one last leg to travel - just a quick hop from Washington National Airport to Norfolk Airport.
It never arrived. Around 10 in the evening, on Jan. 18, 1960, the four-engine commercial airliner crashed near the Chickahominy River in Charles City County, killing all 46 passengers and four crew members.
That was 60 years ago Saturday.
Who remembers? Not many and, surely, not enough.
It was the worst commercial airline crash in Virginia's history, up to that point, and it hit home hard at one of the local newspapers. Promising, talented 26-year-old Norman Regner, a reporter with The Virginian-Pilot, had boarded Flight 20 in Washington.
Regner was a native of Reading, Pennsylvania, the son of Rabbi and Mrs. Sidney L. Regner of New Rochelle, New York. He had joined The Pilot's staff four years earlier after serving in the Army. With a master's degree from Columbia University's School of Journalism and an internship covering the United Nations for The New York Times, he had boundless possibilities before him.
But there was tragedy to go around. There were numerous sailors on board, one a newlywed Navy radarman named Julius Dreher. The passengers included several Naval officers, including Capt. Robert M. Carroll of Boston, a recipient of the Silver Star for gallantry in the South Pacific during World War II.
Jane Anne Fickenscher, a mother of three, died. Her husband, Capt. E.R. Fickenscher, was executive officer of the Oceana Naval Air Station. There were three other service wives on board, too.
"That's too many people to die on one man's place," Charles City County farmer Richard Henry Trench told Daily Press reporter Will Molineux. The plane fell into a ravine on his property.
Molineux was a volunteer for the fire department and a radio under his bed alerted him to the disaster. "I knew a little about that section of Charles City County," Will told us. "And I got that almost before anyone else."
The plane had begun to burn and "you knew immediately that everyone had died in an instant," Molineux said.
He's retired now, but back then Molineux was in the early stages of a distinguished 35-year career with the Daily Press and Times-Herald. As you might imagine, the memories of this grievous event have not diminished for him.
Flight 20 crashed during an era when airlines accidents were notably more frequent. Only three months earlier, a Piedmont Airlines flight had plowed into the Blue Ridge Mountains near Charlottesville and the Charles City disaster was the fourth fatal Capital Airlines in fewer than two years.
Even so, the American public had been won over. In the post-World War II era, elegant train travel quickly yielded to the allure and efficiency of being above it all.
The extraordinary feature of Flight 20's demise could be found in the 1961 Civil Aeronautics Board accident report. The four-engine Vickers Viscount "crashed in a wooded area, striking the ground in a level attitude, with no forward velocity," it says.
In other words, it came straight down with fuselage and wings impaled on trees. The plane wasn't moving forward.
How could that happen? Encountering ice at 8,000 feet, all four turbo-prop engines on the Vickers Viscount successively failed, compromising plane's generator in the process.
The de-icing system, investigators determined afterwards, should have been armed sooner. It had been company policy to delay arming the ice protection system, even in bad conditions, because it caused the engines to lose power.
That policy was subsequently revised by Capital Airlines and, in the year following the crash, the company and its 7,200 employees were merged into United Airlines.
The loss of Flight 20 made national headlines in January 1960 and then there were other crashes and other news and the years rolled by.
Still, it might be a worthy endeavor to recall this history in some formal manner, even if it's only to demonstrate our lasting and heartfelt regret.

Texto completo: KABUL, Afghanistan - The Taliban have offered a brief period of reducing violence in Afghanistan during ongoing negotiations with U.S. diplomats, three officials familiar with the talks said Thursday, a concession seen as important to finalizing a preliminary peace deal between the insurgents and the United States to end their 18-year war.
If the U.S. side accepts the offer, it could amount to the most significant development in the yearlong negotiations since talks resumed after President Donald Trump had scuttled the peace process on the eve of a deal in September.
Though the pledge to reduce violence falls short of the overarching long-term cease-fire sought by the Afghan government, Western diplomats had said getting the Taliban to agree to more than a modest reduction in attacks would be difficult before the withdrawal of foreign forces gets underway.
Details of the offer, confirmed by Western and Taliban officials familiar with the negotiations, were unclear, though the Taliban have said in the past that a reduction in violence would mean scaling back attacks on major cities and highways.
Also unclear was the duration of any reduction - though one Taliban official suggested it was from seven to 10 days - and whether the American side had agreed to the Taliban proposal, which was made on Wednesday. The two sides continued to talk on Thursday.
In a sign that the talks may have reached an important stage, the top commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. Austin Miller, joined the U.S. negotiating team in Doha, Qatar, officials said.
The issue of whether to agree to a cease-fire before the departure of the roughly 13,000 U.S. forces and thousands more NATO troops has been an existential one for the Taliban, who see violence as their most important leverage. The insurgents spent more than a month deliberating Washington's demand.
Members of the Taliban negotiating team repeatedly traveled from Doha, where the talks are taking place, to consult with the group's leaders and commanders in Pakistan, where they enjoy havens. In the end, they came back to the Americans with a proposal of reducing violence for a brief period.
Some officials suggested the arrangement could essentially amount to a cease-fire - in which no attacks are carried out - without explicitly using the term, which some Taliban leaders believe would divide their ranks.
The Taliban's willingness to reduce violence is likely to lead to the signing of the deal between the insurgents and the United States that includes a gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in return for a Taliban pledge that Afghan soil will not be used by international terrorist groups to launch attacks against the United States and its allies.
The signing of a deal would then move the peace process to its next stage, in which the insurgents would sit with the Afghan government, so far excluded in the talks and other political factions to negotiate future power-sharing.

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump wanted to strike down a law that prohibits companies from bribing foreign officials, calling the ban "so unfair" to American companies, two Washington Post reporters recount in a new book.
In the spring of 2017, Trump was at a briefing with Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Trump "perked up" and told Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Trump said it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Trump told Tillerson.
Tillerson explained that he could not repeal the legislation, according to Rucker and Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law.
Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Miller in the hallway, where Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law.
In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company, Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, whom Trump nominated to the position in early 2017.
Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that America's anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017.
And under the current attorney general, William Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."

Hoffa vs. Hoffa How Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino found their way into the character

Texto completo: It's not hard to see what drew two of the finest actors of their generation to play James R. Hoffa. Sure, the man spent decades in the public eye, led what was then the nation's largest labor union, sparred with the Kennedys and disappeared in one of the quintessential unsolved mysteries in recent history. But he's also a great character, a sizzle reel of big, boisterous speeches, roaring dressing-downs and showy theatricality. It's the kind of role an actor can really sink his teeth into, especially if he's known for chewing a bit of scenery - a delicacy frequently enjoyed by both Jack Nicholson, who played the title role in the 1992 "Hoffa," and Al Pacino, currently garnering awards buzz for his work as Hoffa in "The Irishman."
It's frankly surprising it took so long for Hoffa to get the big-screen treatment. "The Enemy Within," Robert F. Kennedy's 1960 book on his congressional mob investigations and dust-ups with Hoffa, was optioned by 20th Century Fox shortly after its publication, with "On the Waterfront" screenwriter Budd Schulberg penning the adaptation. But Ronald Goldfarb, one of Kennedy's colleagues, claimed that it was abandoned because of Teamster intimidation.
So "Hoffa" didn't arrive in theaters until more than three decades later. Though early casting discussions centered, ironically enough, on "The Irishman's" Pacino and Robert De Niro, director Danny DeVito had only one choice: Nicholson, a fellow Jersey boy with whom he had first worked on "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." (Both men were also particularly bankable in 1992, thanks to their consecutive turns as Batman villains.) Fox had high hopes for the production, with Joe Roth telling the Los Angeles Times: "Want to hear the early-morning line? Nicholson's 4-to-5 to win the Oscar on this one."
Nicholson did not win the Oscar - he wasn't even nominated, though he was up for supporting actor that year for "A Few Good Men," released two weeks earlier. "Hoffa" needed enthusiastic reviews and solid box office to gather awards momentum, and it found neither; notices were mixed and it barely earned back half of its nearly $50 million budget (about $90 million in today's dollars), which may have been a factor in all those nos from the major studios that led Martin Scorsese to take "The Irishman" to Netflix.
There are, to be sure, some similarities between the films. Both start at the end of the story, near Hoffa's death, and flash back to the events that brought him there; both portray Hoffa as stubborn, combustible, casually anti-Italian, vehemently anti-Kennedy and utterly intolerant of lateness. (Alas, Nicholson's Hoffa indulges in no ice cream sundaes.) But Hoffa, while only a supporting character in "The Irishman," is the focus of "Hoffa," which covers a much larger span of his life, particularly his early, dirty work of making the Teamsters (and himself) a force to be reckoned with.
The two actors diverge markedly in their portrayals. Nicholson immersed himself in the character, taking pains to physically transform himself into the union chief, via nose putty, eyebrow lifts and other makeup tricks: "Lips clamped, jaws screwed down, forehead willed into an unlikely cube, the kisser on Jack Nicholson's Jimmy Hoffa seems sculpted with a wrench," J. Hoberman wrote in The Village Voice. Nicholson further altered his most distinctive feature, his voice, twisting its devilish purr into Hoffa's stridently nasal Midwestern twang ("Dere's a lot more dere for us").
Though Pacino replicates the labor leader's unmistakable haircut, and his raspy voice occasionally finds its way around a Detroit-Chicago dialect, the actor doesn't particularly look or sound like Hoffa in "The Irishman." This is by design. Though he has played several real historical figures in recent years (Roy Cohn, Jack Kevorkian, Phil Spector, Joe Paterno), he has steered clear of outright impersonation. "You have to find the fictionalization of it in some way," he explained to The New York Times. "You have to find the drama and the character. Because otherwise, do a documentary on someone."
Which is not to say he doesn't do the work. "When you research Hoffa," he told Variety, "there's so much footage on everybody, so you watch it, you study it. You think about it, you engage in it, and you really devote your time to that, who this guy is, and try to absorb him." That last idea is crucial; Pacino "absorbs" Hoffa, but what comes out on-screen is a combination of both their qualities.
This was not always the case. Pacino and his 1970s contemporaries De Niro and Dustin Hoffman were seen, perhaps oversimplistically, as Method-mad chameleons, unrecognizable from role to role. Nicholson, who achieved stardom around the same time, was more in the mold of the classic movie stars, who honed and refined a persona over the course of a career and filtered characters through it; in the decades that followed, he mostly played variations on the madman or the charming rogue (or, sometimes, both simultaneously).
Thus, because his face and (especially) his voice are so familiar, and so rarely vary from character to character, the contrast in "Hoffa" is jarring - this feels less like a performance than an imitation. We're always keenly aware that we're looking at Jack, playing someone else. ("He winds up doing Nicholson shtick in Hoffa makeup," Terrence Rafferty wrote in The New Yorker.) It's somehow easier to accept Pacino as Hoffa, even though his interpretation is rife with his own vocal tics and physical mannerisms, which have become more consistently omnipresent in his performances since ... well, since 1992, when he won the Oscar for "Scent of a Woman," the Oscar that Joe Roth predicted was Nicholson's to lose.
Pacino is, no doubt, aided by the fact that "The Irishman" is a far superior picture to "Hoffa." The latter is handsome and ambitious, but ultimately muddled; the film, and Nicholson's performance, is so focused on externals that it never gives us a sense of the man, or his inner life. Pacino's work may not have the painstaking authenticity of Nicholson's, but it has something more valuable: the richness and humanity of an old pro, unafraid to see this flawed man's qualities in himself.

Texto completo: LONDON - The governments of five countries that lost citizens when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner demanded Thursday that Tehran accept "full responsibility" and pay compensation to the victims' families - though they had little to offer besides moral pressure to get Iran to comply.
After a meeting in London, foreign ministers from Canada, the U.K., Afghanistan, Sweden and Ukraine urged Iran to allow a "thorough, independent and transparent international investigation," as well as a criminal probe and "impartial" judicial proceedings against those found responsible for downing the plane.
All 176 people aboard the Ukraine International Airlines aircraft died when it was brought down by ballistic missiles shortly after taking off from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport on Jan. 8.
The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens, as well as Iranians.
Before the meeting at the Canadian High Commission, ministers from the five nations lit candles at a vigil in memory of the dead passengers and crew members.
Iran initially blamed a technical fault for the plane crash, before acknowledging in the face of mounting evidence that its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard had accidentally brought down the jetliner.
In keeping with international norms, Iran has invited Ukraine, Canada, the United States and France to take part in the crash investigation. But it's unclear whether Iran will share all key details or give the countries full access.
FBI plans to notify states about election breaches at local level
WASHINGTON - The FBI, in a change of policy, is committing to inform state officials if local election systems have been breached, federal officials said Thursday.
In the past, the FBI would alert local governments about attacks on their electoral systems without automatically sharing that information with the state. That meant state officials, left in the dark, might be in a position of certifying the accuracy of election results without realizing there had been problems in individual counties. Alerting local governments about breaches, but not the states, was in keeping with FBI policy of protecting the privacy and identities of actual hacking victims.
Now, though, the FBI will notify both counties victimized by breaches as well as the state's chief election official, and the notification is to be done in person.
Guatemala sweeps up migrants, returns them to the border
EL CINCHADO, Guatemala - Guatemalan police accompanied by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swept up the majority of a group of about 300 migrants Thursday, loaded them on buses and took them back to the Honduran border, effectively dashing their plans to travel together in a "caravan" with hopes of reaching the United States.
Praying and singing songs, the group of adults, teens and young children had set out from a shelter in Entre Rios under rainy skies before dawn and walked about six hours before stopping in the town of Morales to eat and rest.
There they were challenged by police who asked for their entry documents, and nearly all had crossed into Guatemala irregularly and didn't have such documentation.
Prince Harry takes on first duties since royal crisis talks
LONDON - Prince Harry went back to work Thursday, mixing with children playing rugby and offering no hint of the days of turmoil that followed his recent announcement that he wished to step back from royal duties and become financially independent.
It was a fairly standard event for Harry, who watched as children from a local school offer a rugby demonstration on the Buckingham Palace grounds. It marked the first time Harry had taken on a public engagement since announcing last week that he and his wife, Meghan, needed a change.
He joked with the kids and shook hands, but ignored a journalist's question about his future.
Queen Elizabeth II brokered a deal Monday for "a period of transition" to sort out how to be a part-time royal.
Iran's president says 'no limit' to nuke enrichment
TEHRAN, Iran - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said Thursday that there is "no limit" to the country's enrichment of uranium after its decision to abandon its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal in response to the killing of its top general by the U.S.
In a speech, Rouhani said the nuclear program is in a "better situation" than it was before the agreement with world powers.
President Donald Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement in May 2018 and has since imposed "maximum" sanctions on Iran's economy.
Iran abided by the agreement until last summer, when it began openly breaching some of its limits. Thus far, however, it has only modestly increased its nuclear activity. After the Jan. 3 airstrike that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would abandon all restrictions in the nuclear deal.
Pope names 1st woman manager in top office
VATICAN CITY - Pope Francis has tapped an Italian lawyer to be the first woman to hold a management position in the Vatican's most important office, the Secretariat of State.
Francis named Francesca Di Giovanni, a 27-year veteran of the Vatican, as undersecretary for multilateral affairs. She will be responsible for running a division that coordinates the Holy See's relations with the U.N. and other intergovernmental organizations.
Francis has called for women in decision-making roles in the Vatican and Catholic Church at large, though none heads a Vatican congregation or other key office, positions reserved for priests, bishops or cardinals.
Di Giovanni, 66, told the Vatican's in-house media that Francis' appointment Wednesday showed his attention to women.
In Oregon: A teenager who was taken out of state by her mother to avoid surgery for a rare type of liver cancer has had the operation after state welfare officials took her into custody, several Portland, Oregon, TV outlets reported Thursday.
Kylee Dixon, 13, was recovering in an intensive care unit after surgery Tuesday to remove liver tumors.
The Dixons traveled to Las Vegas in June after prosecutors say Christine Dixon refused to turn her daughter over to the state for the surgery. Christine Dixon has said months of chemotherapy debilitated her daughter and that she did much better on CBD oil, a non-psychoactive compound extracted from cannabis plants and other alternative therapies.

In the spring of 2017, Trump was at a briefing with Rex Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and aides in the Oval Office. At the mention of a bribery allegation, Trump "perked up" and told Tillerson that he wanted his help in scrapping the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the authors write.
That law, enacted in 1977 and heavily enforced since around 2005, prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. It has become a major factor in corporate decision-making about operations abroad.
Trump said it was "just so unfair that American companies aren't allowed to pay bribes to get business overseas," according to the book, "A Very Stable Genius," by Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig.
"I need you to get rid of that law," Trump told Tillerson.
Tillerson explained that he could not repeal the legislation, according to Rucker and Leonnig. He pointed out that Congress would need to be involved in any effort to strike it down.
Undeterred, Trump told Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser, to draft an executive action to repeal the law.
Tillerson, the authors write, later caught up with Miller in the hallway, where Miller said he had some skepticism about whether that plan for unilateral executive action could work.
The anecdote meshes with the president's past views of the anti-corruption law.
In a 2012 CNBC appearance, he called it a horrible rule and said that "the world is laughing at us" for enforcing it.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and Justice Department began enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act more concertedly about 15 years ago. It has led to huge fines for companies, including engineering conglomerate Siemens and Brazil's state-owned energy company, Petrobras.
Critics of the government's pursuit of cases under the law have argued that regulators are reading its language too expansively, holding back business.
Skeptics have included Jay Clayton, chairman of the SEC, whom Trump nominated to the position in early 2017.
Clayton was an author of a 2011 paper that argued that America's anti-bribery policies tended "to place disproportionate burdens on U.S. regulated companies in international transactions," hurting American competitiveness.
Despite such criticisms and Trump's misgivings, top administration officials have pledged to uphold the law.
"We will continue to strongly enforce" anti-corruption laws, Jeff Sessions, the attorney general at the time, said in a speech in April 2017.
And under the current attorney general, William Barr, who was confirmed last year, enforcement actions have continued to rapidly roll in.
"The past three years have shown that very little has changed," said Joshua Roth, a lawyer specializing in these issues at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP, despite early expectations that enforcement might fall off under the Trump administration. "What some of us were forecasting really didn't materialize."

Texto completo: Carlos Beltran stepped down from his role as New York Mets manager on Thursday, just 73 days after his hiring. He never managed a single game.
Beltran is far from the first manager or coach in major pro or college sports to never make it to his first game. Since 2000, there have been several others who were fired or stepped down before ever coaching a single game.
Bill Belichick New York Jets - 2000
Oh, what could have been. Belichick was named the Jets' head coach on Jan. 3, 2000 but stepped down one day later to accept the New England Patriots head coaching job. He's still in New England, where he's been to nine Super Bowls and won six of them, both NFL records.
George O'Leary Notre Dame - 2001
O'Leary was named Notre Dame's head coach, but was forced to resign a week later when inconsistencies in his public biographical sketch were brought to light. The biography stated that he lettered in football three times at the University of New Hampshire, but a newspaper report discovered that he had never played in a game.
Mike Price Alabama football - 2003
Price was hired by Alabama in December 2002 but was fired five months later after multiple off-field incidents. He coached spring practice shortly before reports surfaced of Price being seen at a strip club during a trip, where he also had about $1,000 charged to his hotel room by an unknown woman staying in the room. This came after an earlier reprimand for visiting campus-area bars and drinking into the early hours in Tuscaloosa.
Wally Backman Arizona Diamondbacks - 2004
Backman was promoted to the Diamondbacks' manager position after success managing at the minor leauge level. When the New York Times reported the hire, the report included details about serious legal and financial problems, including a DUI arrest, an arrest in a domestic violence incident and a declaration of bankruptcy to avoid paying the IRS.
He was fired four days after he was hired.
Billy Donovan Orlando Magic - 2007
After winning a second-straight national championship at Florida, Donovan accepted an offer to become the Magic's new head coach. A week later, after having second thoughts, he convinced the Magic to release him from his contract.
He returned to Florida for eight more seasons, before leaving for the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2015.
Michael Haywood Pittsburgh football - 2011
Haywood turned the Miami (Ohio) program around in 2010 and parlayed that success into an offer from Pittsburgh. Fifteen days after he accepted that offer, Haywood was arrested on felony domestic violence charges. He was released on bond on New Year's Day 2011, but was fired hours later. He returned to coaching in 2016 at Texas Southern.
Steve Masiello South Florida basketball - 2014
After leading Manhattan into the 2014 NCAA Tournament, Masiello agreed to a deal to become the head coach at USF. But the offer was later rescinded after a report that he lied on his résumé by saying he had graduated from the University of Kentucky when he was still a few credits short. He returned to Manhattan, but was placed on leave until he completed his degree.
Greg Schiano Tennessee football - 2017
Schiano, who recently returned to Rutgers thanks in part to an outpour of support from fans, would have been Tennessee's coach if not for Volunteers' fans responding with outrage. Fans started a social media campaign, pointing out that Schiano worked for Jerry Sandusky at Penn State in the '90s, and the Tennessee administration folded by rescinding the offer to Schiano after the contract had already been signed.
Pat Kelsey Massachusetts basketball - 2017
After winning back-to-back Big South titles at Winthrop, Kelsey accepted the head coaching job at Massachusetts. Two days later, he announced a return to Winthrop for personal reasons, informing the UMass 25 minutes before they were scheduled to introduce him. He remains at Winthrop.
Josh McDaniels Indianapolis Colts - 2018
McDaniels was announced as the Colts coach on Feb. 6, 2018, but withdrew from the position later the same day. He has been the Patriots' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach since 2012, and has been on the Patriots' staff for all six of their Super Bowl titles.
Manny Diaz Temple football - 2019
Diaz, who spent three years as the defensive coordinator at Miami before accepting the Temple head coaching job, was offered Miami's head coaching job less than three weeks after accepting the Temple job. He accepted the Miami job, leaving Temple before the 2019 bowl season even ended.
Patrick Beilein Niagara basketball - 2019
Beilein, the son of Cleveland Cavaliers coach John Beilein, stepped down just weeks before the start of the 2019-20 season. He cited "person reasons" for walking away from the job, which would have been his first Division I head coaching job. Niagara is now coached by former Duke star (and former Syracuse quarterback) Greg Paulus.
Bill Belichick, who became the Jets coach in 2000 when Bill Parcells resigned, left a day later to coach the Patriots.

Texto completo: I never noticed who ran Boeing until their plane took my daughter’s life. Now I know more than I ever dreamed about aviation safety, and I know that a bad board of directors can cost lives.
Boeing has become a personal issue for me since my daughter, Samya Rose Stumo, died March 10 in the crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines. Samya was charismatic, intelligent, beautiful and caring. Since the crash, our family — and many other victims’ families — have endured grief, exhaustion and depression while adjusting to new, diminished lives.
David Calhoun started as the new CEO of Boeing this week. However, he has been part of a problematic board for the past 10 years of bad decision making at Boeing. He is thus partly responsible for 346 lives lost after two crashes on the 737 Max.
Might Calhoun save the company? Only if he replaces executive and board management with new leaders focused on product performance, innovation and safety rather than simply generating cash for shareholders.
My family and I have learned more than we ever wanted to know about the design, certification, regulation and production of commercial airplanes. Boeing’s change of management is not new, but its officials must chart a new course and tell shareholders to accept a cut. The company must focus on rigorously instituting best performance practices befitting a national champion aviation and defense company.
Concerns about Boeing's board
Calhoun must decide whether Boeing will continue to be a dividend rock star, or become a performance and safety champion. Will it compete with companies interested in massive investor payouts, or instead compete with members of its own industry, like Airbus and Lockheed Martin, to produce the most innovative and safe aircraft?
These changes are crucial. But I’m concerned that Boeing’s board of directors remains the source of its problems.
To start with, Calhoun comes from a background working under Jack Welch at General Electric — when the company transitioned from making great products toward a finance-oriented approach. Other Boeing leadership also came from GE, including board member Mike Zafirovski and former CEO W. James McNerney. In response to a 2014 comment from McNerney about Boeing employees "cowering" while he was CEO, one machinists union labor leader said, “The Jack Welch style of anti-personnel management is still alive and well at Boeing. ”
In 2011, Calhoun and the rest of Boeing's board faced a challenge from an Airbus aircraft. To save money, they chose to build the 737 Max by using an old frame design rather than develop a new aircraft.
Air travel has never been safer: FAA admin. on Boeing 737 Max: We're still deciding 'when, whether' plane will fly again
From 2016 to early 2017, Boeing fired engineers and reduced its commercial airplane workforce by almost 8,000. In the first few months of 2017 alone, Boeing cut 1,332 engineering and technical jobs from its Washington state workforce.
One engineer, who was laid off after the Max was certified, told Bloomberg, “They were targeting the highly paid, highly experienced engineers. Over time, that’s eroded the company’s ability to successfully design and manage programs. ”
From 2013 to 2019, the Boeing board voted to spend what amounted to 104% of profits on stock buybacks, plus paid out billions in shareholder dividends, representing 42% of its profits. These are funds that could have been used to pursue additional engineering and safety measures.
Former Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg: We are taking actions to enhance the safety of the 737 Max
Boeing lobbied to speed up aircraft certification, prompting the Federal Aviation Administration to shift aspects of certification and design oversight of aircraft from the FAA to the company. Starting in 2005, federal rules were changed to designate an aircraft manufacturer as part of the FAA's Organization Designation Authorization program, which allowed airline manufacturers like Boeing a substantial role in determining whether their planes were safe to fly.
In fact, a 2013 Government Accountability Office report found company employees approved by the FAA were performing more than 90% of certification tasks.
Can Boeing turn around their culture?
Now, Boeing’s leadership must institute a culture focused on safety in more than name. But it is unclear that Calhoun or many Boeing board members know how to do so.
We know that Boeing engineers were pressured by their managers to limit their safety analysis to keep costs down. Congressional investigators recently learned that Boeing employees had serious misgivings about the 737 Max. In internal messages published by The New York Times, one anonymous Boeing employee said in 2017 that the plane was “designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys. ”
Airlines have no plans, no solutions: Airlines tell parents to pay up or risk sitting rows away from their kids. That's wrong.
According to performance research firm MSCI, which ranks the quality of a company's governance, Boeing’s board falls in the bottom third of S&P 500 companies. Why? Their pay is too much, even compared with other company boards. They have apparent conflicts of interest. And, their experience is often irrelevant.
One corporate governance expert told Fortune: “It’s as though the reforms and the additional scrutiny and the best practices of the last 20 years kind of passed them by. ”
Lastly, the 737 Max might never be totally safe for flight. Federal regulators continue to discover new software problems that compromise stability and airworthiness. And we learned from a recent congressional hearing that another crucial system, the rudder cables, were not modified to address more than a dozen safety specialists' concerns. Did Boeing or the FAA actually do thorough safety assessments on all critical systems? If so, will they make them public?
David Calhoun is an unlikely choice to guide fundamental, necessary changes at Boeing. If he is to outperform our expectations, he must shift the company’s Wall Street-oriented culture toward an aggressive focus on product performance, engineering innovation and safety excellence.
Michael Stumo lives in lives in Sheffield, Massachusetts. He is a plaintiff in a lawsuit against Boeing.

Texto completo: LAS VEGAS – Conor McGregor is the biggest star in the history of mixed martial arts, and that isn't likely to change anytime soon.
But is he still capable of performing at the incredibly high levels he displayed on his way to the pinnacle of the UFC?
That question will be answered Saturday at UFC 246.
McGregor (21-4 MMA, 9-2 UFC), a former UFC lightweight and featherweight champion, seeks his first win in more than three years, moving up to 170 pounds to take on Donald "Cowboy" Cerrone (36-13, 23-10), a grizzled veteran of the sport whose name is found throughout the promotion's record book.
"Conor McGregor is one of the biggest stars in the history of combat sports, period," UFC president Dana White told USA TODAY Sports. "When you mention Conor McGregor's name, you're talking (Mike) Tyson, 'Sugar' Ray Leonard, (Floyd) Mayweather. He's on that list. He has some of the biggest, and the biggest, pay-per-views of all time."
White said the event at T-Mobile Arena will be another massive financial success, estimating a $10.6 million live gate and suggesting the event is "trending off the charts for pay-per-view."
There is no title on the line, though White has suggested McGregor would earn a crack at regaining the lightweight belt should he beat Cerrone.
Still, the stakes are high for McGregor, who has battled through numerous personal issues in the 15 months since his last octagon appearance, facing charges of assault and criminal mischief and even finding himself in the center of two sexual assault investigations, according to New York Times reports.
But in the days leading up to UFC 246, McGregor appears to be a bit of a changed man, approaching fight week with an air of charisma and charm that has been missing in recent years.
"Conor took some much-needed time off to get his personal life together," White said. "He is the classic story of super rich and super famous really fast. It takes a toll on people, and it looks and sounds to me like he's got it all under control now."
But the real test – at least inside the cage – comes Saturday night. A perennial fan favorite, Cerrone has the most wins in UFC history, the most knockdowns in UFC history, the most finishes in UFC history, and the list goes on. In short, Cerrone is not simply a fighter brought in to give McGregor a guaranteed victory.
Even McGregor, with his famed quick wit, has shied away from trying to minimize Cerrone's chances.
"You've seen him compete so many times, it's hard not to respect Donald," McGregor said. "He has my respect, and although there will be blood spilled on Jan. 18, it will not be bad blood."
Win or lose, McGregor will remain a sellable commodity after UFC 246. But "The Notorious" has visions of retiring as one of the greatest to ever set foot in the cage.
While his rise was historic, McGregor now looks to show sustainability in this next chapter of his career.

A few minutes later, she was slathering lavender oil on her tattooed arms. "I don't like perfume," she said. "It makes me feel like a dead lady - like I'm being embalmed."
Despite all the death talk and the fact that her latest collection of poetry, "Life of the Party," revolves around violence against women, Gatwood, 27, is easygoing and effervescent (not to mention resourceful - backstage, she turned avocados into impromptu guacamole with little more than a wine key and a coffee stirrer).
She recently finished her tour across the United States with singer Ari Chi and cellist Cailin Nolte. Gatwood plans and funds her own tours and often handles the transportation herself, driving a 10-passenger van from city to city.
Gatwood started performing poetry in high school; soon after graduating, she was part of Brave New Voices, a poetry festival that has been featured on HBO. But many of her fans found her through YouTube, where she has cultivated a mostly female audience with performances of poems such as "Manic Pixie Dream Girl" and "Ode to My Bitch Face" that have garnered hundreds of thousands of views. A children's book she wrote with Mahogany L. Browne and Elizabeth Acevedo, "Woke: A Young Poet's Call to Justice," is scheduled for release in March.
Gatwood grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a city with more than its share of violence (its metro area had one of the United States' highest murder rates in 2018). The city's struggles, she said, affected her from a young age. In her poem "BODY COUNT: 13," she describes the West Mesa murders, an unsolved case involving the disappearance and murder of 11 women and a fetus whose remains were found on the outskirts of Albuquerque a decade after they were buried. She was 17 when the bodies were discovered.
Her parents, whom she described as hippies, never set a curfew and didn't always shield her from life. Her mother was a sex educator before becoming an HIV epidemiologist - Gatwood remembers having a stuffed animal in the shape of the chlamydia virus and knowing about HIV when she was 5 - and her father, who according to Gatwood resembles Ted Bundy, was a middle-school teacher from whom she inherited her emotional nature.
Her father, Byron Gatwood, said she was fixated on language early on. "She was very interested always in the dynamics of relationships, the idea of how people get along and what the rules are, whether they're written or not," he said.
"Life of the Party" is largely a memoir, with memories of friendship as well as violence. In "Mans/Laughter," Gatwood shares, among other things, the sexual harassment she endured from her boss while working at a bakery in high school. Her book doesn't mention that as a 15-year-old, she organized other women who had been victimized and reported the bakery to the EEOC. She eventually received a settlement of more than $10,000.
"I encouraged her not to. I said they're not going to do anything about it. And she, she plowed ahead totally on her own," her mother, Jill Gatwood, said. "I thought it was good that she was standing up for herself."
"Life of the Party" is also a meditation on Olivia Gatwood's obsession with the true crime genre and her long-running fear of male violence. "I've always been really afraid of men," she said. "I think that's really rational for a young girl to feel that way."
Living in a ground-floor apartment in Boston prompted much of the work in the book. In an author's note that details her many sleepless nights, she writes: "I was afraid of something very specific: a man climbing through my first-floor apartment window, which realistically could have been popped open with a butter knife, and strangling me in my bed." After she finished writing it, she said, she slept her first full night by herself.
Melissa Lozada-Oliva, a poet who hosts the podcast "Say More" with Gatwood and who said they first bonded over the gaps in their front teeth, said that she knew Gatwood struggled with the book. That was partly because Gatwood sought in her writing to address "her privilege as a white woman - acknowledging who gets to talk about violence and who gets to talk about violence being inflicted on them," Lozada-Oliva said.
During the Brooklyn performance, Gatwood was greeted with roaring applause when she read "Ode to My Bitch Face," which is just what it sounds like, and "Ode to the Women of Long Island" ("who / when I show them the knife I carry in my purse / tell me it's not big enough"). Afterward, she spent more than an hour signing books and getting to know some of the teenage girls and young women who came.
Mary Cornwell and Abigail Buchholz, a mother and daughter who drove five hours from Virginia, were among them. Buchholz first discovered Gatwood's work on YouTube and shared it with Cornwell, who said the poems resonated with her as both a woman and a mother. "It's beautiful and relevant to all generations," she said.
At the beginning of Gatwood's writing career, she wanted her audience to be "misogynistic men on the internet," the people who perhaps needed to hear her work the most.
After many death and rape threats, she shifted her focus.
"It's less important to me to change the minds of the people who want me dead," Gatwood said. "And more important that I make girls feel less alone."

Texto completo: Carlos Beltran stepped down from his role as New York Mets manager on Thursday, just 73 days after his hiring. He never managed a single game.
Beltrán is far from the first manager or coach in major pro or college sports to never make it to his first game. Since 2000, there have been several others who were fired or stepped down before ever coaching a single game.
Bill Belichick New York Jets - 2000
Oh, what could have been. Belichick was named the Jets' head coach on Jan. 3, 2000 but stepped down one day later to accept the New England Patriots head coaching job. He's still in New England, where he's been to nine Super Bowls and won six of them, both NFL records.
George O'Leary Notre Dame - 2001
O'Leary was named Notre Dame's head coach, but was forced to resign a week later when inconsistencies in his public biographical sketch were brought to light. The biography stated that he lettered in football three times at the University of New Hampshire, but a newspaper report discovered that he had never played in a game.
Mike Price Alabama football - 2003
Price was hired by Alabama in December 2002 but was fired five months later after multiple off-field incidents. He coached spring practice shortly before reports surfaced of Price being seen at a strip club during a trip, where he also had about $1,000 charged to his hotel room by an unknown woman staying in the room. This came after an earlier reprimand for visiting campus-area bars and drinking into the early hours in Tuscaloosa.
Wally Backman Arizona Diamondbacks - 2004
Backman was promoted to the Diamondbacks' manager position after success managing at the minor leauge level. When the New York Times reported the hire, the report included details about serious legal and financial problems, including a DUI arrest, an arrest in a domestic violence incident and a declaration of bankruptcy to avoid paying the IRS. He was fired four days after he was hired.
Billy Donovan Orlando Magic - 2007
After winning a second-straight national championship at Florida, Donovan accepted an offer to become the Magic's new head coach. A week later, after having second thoughts, he convinced the Magic to release him from his contract. He returned to Florida for eight more seasons, before leaving for the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2015.
Michael Haywood Pittsburgh football - 2011
Haywood turned the Miami (Ohio) program around in 2010 and parlayed that success into an offer from Pittsburgh. Fifteen days after he accepted that offer, Haywood was arrested on felony domestic violence charges. He was released on bond on New Year's Day 2011, but was fired hours later. He returned to coaching in 2016 at Texas Southern.
Steve Masiello South Florida basketball - 2014
After leading Manhattan into the 2014 NCAA Tournament, Masiello agreed to a deal to become the head coach at USF. But the offer was later rescinded after a report that he lied on his résumé by saying he had graduated from the University of Kentucky when he was still a few credits short. He returned to Manhattan, but was placed on leave until he completed his degree.
Greg Schiano Tennessee football - 2017
Schiano, who recently returned to Rutgers thanks in part to an outpour of support from fans, would have been Tennessee's coach if not for Volunteers' fans responding with outrage. Fans started a social media campaign, pointing out that Schiano worked for Jerry Sandusky at Penn State in the '90s, and the Tennessee administration folded by rescinding the offer to Schiano after the contract had already been signed.
Pat Kelsey Massachusetts basketball - 2017
After winning back-to-back Big South titles at Winthrop, Kelsey accepted the head coaching job at Massachusetts. Two days later, he announced a return to Winthrop for personal reasons, informing the Massachusetts administration 25 minutes before the press conference scheduled to introduce him. He remains at Winthrop.
Josh McDaniels Indianapolis Colts - 2018
McDaniels was announced as the Colts head coach on Feb. 6, 2018, but withdrew from the position later the same day. He has been the New England Patriots' offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach since 2012, and has been on the Patriots' staff for all six of their Super Bowl titles.
Manny Diaz Temple football - 2019
Diaz, who spent three years as the defensive coordinator at Miami before accepting the Temple head coaching job, was offered Miami's head coaching job less than three weeks after accepting the Temple job. He accepted the Miami job, leaving Temple before the 2019 bowl season even ended.
Patrick Beilein Niagara basketball - 2019
Beilein, the son of Cleveland Cavaliers coach John Beilein, stepped down just weeks before the start of the 2019-20 season. He cited "person reasons" for walking away from the job, which would have been his first Division I head coaching job. Niagara is now coached by former Duke star (and former Syracuse quarterback) Greg Paulus.
Bill Belichick, who became the New York Jets head coach when Bill Parcells resigned Monday Jan. 3, abruptly resigned the position during a news conference one day later.

TRUMP: I DON'T KNOW GIULIANI ASSOCIATE

Texto completo: WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday denied knowing Lev Parnas, a former associate of his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani who in interviews has said Trump was fully engaged in the campaign to pressure Ukrainian officials into opening an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden.
Parnas, a Ukrainian-American businessman from Florida, said in interviews with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, The New York Times and CNN's Anderson Cooper that Giuliani tapped him to act on behalf of Trump in Ukraine to push for a probe that could have benefitted Trump politically.
"It was all about 2020, to make sure he had another four years," Parnas told Cooper in an interview that aired Thursday.
Parnas told Maddow he was directed by Giuliani in May to deliver an ultimatum to newly elected Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky that "all aid" from the United States would be suspended.
Further, Parnas said Giuliani told him to say no senior U.S. officials would attend Zelensky's inauguration ceremony if he did not announce an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter, who previously served on the board of a Ukraine gas company.
"It was never about corruption," Parnas told Maddow.
Parnas' assertions went against Trump's argument that his order to withhold nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine, and his request for Zelensky to launch an investigation into the Bidens, stemmed from his desire to root out corruption in the war-torn eastern European nation.
In an interview that aired Wednesday, Parnas told Maddow: "President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all of my movements ... I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president."
Trump, who denied knowing Parnas after the latter's arrest in October on unrelated federal campaign finance charges, insisted again Thursday that he didn't know "who this man is, other than I guess he attended fundraisers."
"I meet thousands and thousands of people as president. I take thousands of pictures," Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. "I don't know him, I never had a conversation that I remember with him."
Parnas, who has pleaded not guilty to the campaign finance charges, and his attorney Joseph A. Bondy, have posted numerous photos on social media of Parnas smiling alongside Trump and members of the Trump family at events, including a 2018 White House dinner.
Parnas told Maddow Trump "lied" when he denied knowing Parnas and fellow associate Igor Fruman.
"I mean, we're not friends," Parnas said. "Me and him didn't watch football games together, we didn't eat hot dogs. But he knew exactly who we were, who I was especially."
Asked about Parnas' statements, Giuliani told The Associated Press in a text message: "I thought he was an honorable man. I was wrong."
Asked directly if Parnas was lying, Giuliani replied, "I'm not responding yet."
Parnas, speaking to Maddow, also said he believed Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General William Barr were aware of the back channel effort to secure a Ukrainian investigation.
"Barr was basically on the team," Parnas said, adding that Pence spoke with Zelensky about the need for an investigation into Biden during a September meeting in Poland.
A spokeswoman for Barr called Parnas' assertion "100% false." Pence, speaking to reporters in Florida said he never met Parnas.
Congressional Democrats, pointing to Parnas' interviews and documents he provided to House Democrats that were released this week, said the new information underscored the need for Senate Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow additional documents and witnesses to be admitted into the Senate's impeachment trial slated to start Tuesday.
"There seems to be documentation that would validate what Parnas is saying, but that all has to be subjected to scrutiny," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters at her weekly news conf

Stay Woke, Drop Out

Texto completo: To paraphrase Santayana, Democrats who refuse to acknowledge Hillary Clinton's failures in the 2016 election were always doomed to repeat them. Why is their primary field littered with the failed bids of woke candidates? Why is #WarrenIsASnake trending on Twitter? Because identity politics remains a political loser.
That's the takeaway from the rapidly narrowing Democratic field, and smart liberals warned of it after 2016. Mark Lilla, writing in the New York Times, faulted Mrs. Clinton for molding her campaign around "the rhetoric of diversity, calling out explicitly to African-American, Latino, LGBT and women voters at every stop." Successful politics, he noted, is always rooted in visions of "shared destiny."
Progressives heaped scorn on Mr. Lilla -- one compared him to David Duke -- and doubled down on identity politics. Nearly every flashpoint in this Democratic race has centered on racism, sexism or classism. Nearly every practitioner of that factionalist strategy has exited the race. Mr. Lilla is surely open to apologies.
Kamala Harris created the first big viral moment when she tore into Joe Biden, absolving him of being a "racist" even as she accused him of working with segregationists to oppose school busing. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand didn't hold the race card but ran a campaign about "women's equality," attacking any Democrat who didn't measure to her standards on abortion, child care and violence against women.
Sen. Cory Booker campaigned relentlessly on "systemic racism" and "social justice," blasting Mr. Biden for his work on the 1994 crime bill and warning the nation of an "all-out assault" on black voting rights in 2020. Beto O'Rourke felt the need to make up for his own whiteness by going all in on reparations for slavery. Julian Castro built his run on complaints about "discriminatory housing policy," injustices to transgender and indigenous women, and threats to marginalized communities.
Which bring us to Elizabeth Warren's attempt to rescue her campaign with a Hail Mary appeal to "sexism." Her campaign leaked in the run-up to Tuesday's debate the claim that Mr. Sanders, in a private 2018 meeting, told her he didn't believe a woman could win the presidency. Mr. Sanders denied it. When the inevitable CNN question came Tuesday night, Ms. Warren played the victim and rolled out a rehearsed statistic about the election failure rate of the men on stage. She praised the Democratic Party for having "stepped up" to elect a Catholic president in 1960 and a black one in 2008 and suggested it should do the same for a female candidate today. Sen. Amy Klobuchar cheered her on.
This is the politics of exclusion -- and it explains why a field that began as the most diverse in Democratic history is now coming down to a competition between two old white men. Candidates who speak primarily to subsections of the country are by necessity excluding everybody else. All voters want to know what a candidate is going to do specifically for them, and for the country as a whole. And while many voters view issues in a moral context, few voters feel a moral imperative to vote for candidates solely because they are black, or female, or gay. It's an unpersuasive argument.
Identity politics is also by necessity vote-losing, because it requires accusations. Ms. Warren is getting blowback now after implying that Mr. Sanders is a misogynist, and calling him a liar. Sanders supporters are lacing Ms. Warren on social media with snake emojis and declaring a #NeverWarren campaign. Even if she stages a comeback, she's alienated a key base of support.
Precisely because Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders don't have easy identity-politics cards to play, they've focused on broader themes. Yes, they give shout-outs to core liberal constituencies, but Mr. Biden's consistent argument is that he is the only one qualified to beat Mr. Trump, while Mr. Sanders's is that America needs to overhaul its economic system. Those are positions around which greater numbers of Democrats can unify.
Beyond the brief viral moments they obtained with their made-for-TV attacks, the dropouts never provided a compelling or even memorable agenda. What was Mr. Booker's vision for the country? Did Ms. Harris ever nail down a plan for health care? Was Mr. Castro capable of talking beyond Section 1325 of immigration law? The notion that a Democratic primary audience that nominated Mr. Obama more than a decade ago somehow rejected these candidates because of their race or sex is laughable.
What they rejected, yet again, is a form of politics that pits groups of Americans against one another. It's never been a winner, and the sooner woke candidates awaken to that reality, the better for them and the country.

Texto completo: When Elizabeth Warren aimed her character assassination at Bernie Sanders in the seventh Democratic presidential debate, she may have thought she'd won a round. And maybe she did.
But the real winner was that old red baiter, the late Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin.
To paraphrase another McCarthy (Mary, the writer), everything that man said and did was a lie. His dishonesty was so profound that every word he uttered, including "and" and "but," was a lie.
Sure, politicians lie. Joe Biden has told some whoppers. So has Donald Trump.
But Joe McCarthy turned politics itself into a lie by stringing together insinuation, hearsay, labeling and outright defamation. These fed what became known as "the paranoid style" of American politics. The idea is to make the public think about a fellow citizen: Maybe he is not what he seems. Maybe he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
The insinuation cannot just boost the accuser. It has to discredit his target.
Joe McCarthy turned legislative oversight into a witch hunt. He did it by accusing people of something they could often not disprove. He did it by discrediting anyone who questioned him. He attacked and then played the victim.
Joe McCarthy took a label - communist, or more often, communist sympathizer, a category so broad it could apply to anyone who crossed McCarthy - and made it libel per se. Slap that label on someone and they were done - their career and reputation in tatters.
Now, Ms. Warren is not Joe McCarthy and the woke and cancel culture types are not the House Un-American activities committee. But Ms. Warren's slur against Mr. Sanders - calling him a sexist - is the triumph of McCarthyism. It is the politics of accusation and morally undermining someone, not with an argument, but an accusation and a label.
Try defending yourself by saying, "I'm not a sexist." Or, "I'm not a racist."
Everything Ms. Warren did - every step she took in this little episode - was repugnant.
First, she leaked a private accusation to a news organization that reported it as fact without attribution or verification.
Verification was impossible since only two people were present - Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders.
She says he told her that a woman could not be elected president. He says he never said it. She, tellingly, did not press the point in the debate. But a CNN reporter did, basically calling Mr. Sanders a liar.
But is it likely that Mr. Sanders was lying? He is known for being cantankerous and independent, but not for lying.
It is more likely that Ms. Warren, who was no more a Native American than Joe McCarthy was a war hero, misheard, bent the truth or reconstructed it to suit her purposes one year after the conversation.
Good reporters, cops, historians and biographers learn very quickly that any two people who were the only witnesses to an event, or participants in a conversation, may tell it in two very different ways.
That's the charitable explanation. The less charitable one is that Ms. Warren, who, unlike Bernie, has a mixed record with truth, repurposed and refashioned a memory to help her fading campaign.
But she did it with an epithet, not an argument.
Maybe Bernie said: A woman can win the presidency. (He has been saying it for 30 years.) But you can't, Elizabeth.
Who knows?
Not CNN.
Suppose that Ms. Warren had said in that meeting: An old Jew can not be elected president. Would Bernie be justified in revealing this private conversation? And would he be justified in calling the person who said it ageist and antisemitic?
Ms. Warren did a sleazy thing.
Friends do not violate each other's trust.
And public people should be judged on public records and public words. For all of us should be allowed privacy and space in which to be foolish or wrong, even politicians. Lyndon Johnson said many ugly and unfortunate things in private that he may have meant lightly or meant not at all. Before you call him a racist or bigot, look at what he said and did in the public eye and when at work.
Bernie Sanders is almost certainly not a private sexist. He was working for equal rights and winning elections while doing so when Ms. Warren was still teaching at Harvard. Unless someone at CNN has acquired godlike powers, none of us can read or judge another heart. We have to go by actions and the public record. Mr. Sanders offered to back Ms. Warren for president in 2016. He ran after she demurred.
But there is something else, something even darker in Ms. Warren's actions - engaging in presumptive libel just before the Iowa caucuses to try to discredit Mr. Sanders.
This is true McCarthyism.
It is the old Tail Gunner Joe cocktail: Innuendo, hearsay, labeling and defamation.
"Sexist" is not as bad as misogynist, the next step on the libel ladder. Nor does it compare to the true moral equivalent to "communist" today - "racist" - but sexist is discrediting and for many disqualifying.
It is a fair and useful thing to attack systemic racism or sexism - like the disrespect for female filmmakers in woke Hollywood. But what is the value of calling someone with no record of racism or sexism a racist or sexist? There is no value to anyone but the name-caller. He, or she, has managed to besmirch the named, and maybe critically wound and silence him.
It is loathsome. And it is a form of psychological manipulation. Bernie cannot say to a woman who accuses him of sexism, "That's a lie." That would "prove" his sexism.
Oh, for the days when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton fought about health care plans.
Character assassination, labeling with a libelous word, impugning, is not politics. It is opposite of politics. It is way beyond an ad hominem argument. It is the abandoning of argument for violence by other means - the word as a weapon instead of a tool.

Texto completo: Stream the film that earned Antonio Banderas his first Oscar nomination, and catch House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Andrew Yang on "Real Time."
What's Streaming
PAIN AND GLORY (2019) Rent or purchase on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu and Google Play. The nominations for the 92nd annual Academy Awards were announced on Monday, recognizing many of the best films and performances of the year, some of which are already available to stream. Among them is Pedro Almodóvar's "Pain and Glory," which was nominated for best international feature film. Antonio Banderas was also nominated for best actor in a leading role, his first Oscar nomination in his nearly 40-year career. Banderas also won the best actor prize at last year's Cannes Film Festival for this role, as a depressed Spanish filmmaker who bears a curious resemblance to Almodóvar in career and appearance. "These teasing biographical gestures blur the line between reality and representation, but to see this movie as confessional would miss the point," Manohla Dargis wrote in her New York Times review, in which she designated the film a Critic's Pick. "The point is the blur, that in-between space where art blooms."
ARES Stream on Netflix. This new Dutch horror series joins Netflix's international roster of creepy psychological thrillers like Germany's "Dark" or the French-Belgian show "Black Spot." Running for eight episodes, the series follows Rosa (Jade Olieberg) and Jacob (Tobias Kersloot), friends who uncover a secret student society in Amsterdam that appears to share a dress code with the "Eyes Wide Shut" cabal. During their initiation, Rosa and Jacob discover ties to the city's wealthy and powerful, as well as secrets from their country's past.
TROOP ZERO Stream on Amazon. This film, adapted from a play by the "Beasts of the Southern Wild" co-writer Lucy Alibar, will likely win over any former scouts who were bitten by the adventure bug at a young age, but wound up regrettably spending more time at troop meetings or selling cookies. It's 1977, and Christmas Flint (Mckenna Grace), is an outer space-obsessed 12-year-old who decides to form her own Birdie Scout group in a bid to win a contest that would feature the top troop's voices on one of the Voyager I Golden Records. Christmas taps Rayleen (Viola Davis), a local woman who works for her widowed father (Jim Gaffigan), to lead the group, to which she's recruited fellow outcasts. Together they work to defeat the popular girls' troop, presided over by Miss Massey, who is played by Allison Janney. The movie "possesses all the elements of a traditional film about underdogs, retrofitted for a new generation," Lovia Gyarkye wrote in her Times review.
What's on TV
REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER 10 p.m. on HBO. Maher kicks off the 18th season of his late-night talk show by welcoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on the show amid impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Maher will also chat with Andrew Yang, one of the Democratic candidates running for president, a former tech executive campaigning on establishing a universal basic income of $ 1,000 per month for all Americans. The journalist and contributing New York Times opinion writer Kara Swisher, the author Jon Meacham and former Representative Joe Walsh will appear as roundtable guests.

Texto completo: STUDENT LOANS
I.R.S. Won't Collect Taxes On Some Discharged Debt
In a decision that will bring relief to tens of thousands of student loan borrowers, the Internal Revenue Service has expanded the pool of people who will not have to pay taxes on the balance of their forgiven loans.
The I.R.S. said its ruling would provide "appropriate" relief to borrowers by waiving taxes on both federal and private loans that are forgiven because their schools misled them or closed abruptly.
The decision announced Wednesday expands an exemption that was granted to borrowers at Corinthian Colleges and the American Career Institute, two failed for-profit schools that stranded their students with incomplete degrees and credits that were hard to transfer. In those circumstances, the Education Department allows borrowers to have their federal loan debts eliminated through its Closed School Discharge program.
The I.R.S. decision also covers borrowers who have their loans eliminated through a program know as Borrower Defense to Repayment, which allows loans to be forgiven when schools act fraudulently. STACY COWLEY
COMPANIES
Gap Scuttles Plan
To Spin Off Old Navy
Gap says it no longer intends to spin off Old Navy as a separate public company.
The San Francisco-based retailer said Thursday that its board scuttled the move after determining it would be too costly and complex, especially given the company's recent struggles.
Its stock was up about 5 percent in after-hours trading Thursday.
Gap announced in February 2019 that it planned to split into two publicly traded companies, one for its low-cost Old Navy brand and another for the Gap, Banana Republic and its lesser known brands like Athleta, Intermix and Hill City. But analysts started to doubt Gap would stick with the plan when it fired its chief executive Art Peck in November after his efforts to reinvigorate the business failed.
At that time, the retailer also lowered its earnings outlook for the fiscal year after sales at the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy fell in the fiscal third quarter. The company also announced that Robert J. Fisher, Gap's non-executive chairman, would serve as president and chief executive on an interim basis. Fisher is the son of Gap's co-founders Donald and Doris F. Fisher.
"The work we've done to prepare for the spin shone a bright light on operational inefficiencies and areas for improvement," said Fisher in a statement Thursday. "We have learned a lot and intend to operate Gap Inc. in a more rigorous and transformational manner that empowers our growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, and appropriately focuses on profitability for Banana Republic and Gap brand."
The company reiterated on Thursday that it intends to hire a new CEO. It also announced that Neil Fiske, president and CEO of Gap brand, will leave the company
Gap said it now expects total company fiscal 2019 comparable sales and net sales to both be at the higher end of its previous guidance range of down mid-single digits and down low-single digits, respectively. As a result of better-than-anticipated discount levels over the holiday period, particularly at Old Navy, it now estimates its adjusted fiscal year 2019 earnings per share to be moderately above its previous per share guidance of $ 1.70 to $ 1.75.
The company plans to release final fiscal fourth-quarter results on Feb. 27.
Like many mall-based clothing chains, Gap is struggling to turn itself around as shoppers go online or to discounters like T.J. Maxx for their clothing. But Gap, which defined casual dressing in the 1990s, has also long struggled with its own deep-rooted problems -- its offerings have failed to stand out from that of its rivals.

Hedlyne Goes For Maximum of Two Lines
JPMorgan Chase disclosed this week that less than 5 percent of its nearly 3,700 financial advisers are black and said it still had work to do to improve diversity in its ranks. But some Democratic lawmakers want to know more.
Congressional Democrats in both chambers were critical of the bank on Thursday for its response to questions they raised in response to a New York Times report about racism at some of the bank's branches in Arizona.
A financial adviser there recorded his boss disparaging a black customer as being "from Section 8," a reference to public housing, and saying she did not deserve to be in the bank's program for elite customers. Another black customer, the former National Football League player Jimmy Kennedy, struggled for months to get access to a package of perks for wealthy clients -- a delay that an employee told him was connected to his race.
Last month, five Democratic senators and two Democratic congressmen sent letters to JPMorgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, seeking a detailed explanation of those episodes and an accounting of the bank's plans to address black employees' discrimination complaints.
The bank responded this week, but it did not provide specific answers to those questions. EMILY FLITTER

Texto completo: Art REview
THE PURSUIT OF EVERYTHING: MAIRA KALMAN'S BOOKS FOR CHILDREN
At Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, 125 West Bay Road, Amherst, through April 5. 413-559-6300, www.carlemuseum.org
AMHERST — A pair of tiny-footed socks with ridiculously long legs hangs in the entryway to “The Pursuit of Everything: Maira Kalman's Books for Children." It's on display along with a jar of buttons, several candy bars with silly names like “Crunky," a photo portrait of a doleful Basset Hound, a “This Is Little Lulu" vintage comic, and plenty more.
It's a re-creation of the artist and writer's workspace, or in her own words, a “museum of the mind." She uses the phrase to describe the marvels of Monticello in her book “Thomas Jefferson: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Everything."
Kalman is no Jefferson, to be sure, but her tastes and inspirations on view here vividly reflect an imagination brimming with the arcane, the absurd, the art historical, and the affectionate. This tart and tender exhibition, organized by guest curator Jane Bayard Curley, is at the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art.
Even if you don't know Kalman, you may know her work. She has published 18 children's books and a dozen for adults. She's made giant murals for Grand Central Station and collaborated with David Byrne of Talking Heads, writer Daniel Handler (a.k.a. Lemony Snicket), and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, among others. She has drawn 15 New Yorker covers — the most famous is also the best-selling, a map of “New Yorkistan" drawn with Rick Meyerowitz and published in 2002.
If you believe a short day-in-the-life film about her made by her son, Alex Kalman, she takes piano lessons from a long-suffering teacher named Mrs. Danziger, played in the movie by a chicken named Lorelle.
This is the wry world of Maira Kalman, and it is a balm.
I was in a stew when I walked into the exhibition, having listened to the news on my way to Amherst. One of the first things I saw was a compendium of dogs' names she put together for her book “Beloved Dog." Pancake, Buster, Pickles, and many more, stacked high in her trademark scrawl on the wall.
Dogs! Good, loyal, and true! The list blew the dark shards of the news from my mind like a great, cool wind.
Kalman was born in Tel Aviv in 1949 and moved to New York with her family as a small child. She met her late husband, graphic designer Tibor Kalman, at New York University. She published her first book in 1987 after Tibor, who had helped design Talking Heads cover art, introduced her to Byrne. Kalman's two children, Alex and Lulu, were small at the time.
If you're looking for a cheeky repudiation to lullaby books such as “Good Night Moon," this is it. “Stay Up Late," based on the lyrics to Byrne's song of the same name, captures the affectionate (if maniacal) intent of a child to keep an infant sibling awake all night. Kalman's jaunty, frenetic illustrations poke all over the page in simmering colors. Their rhythm and sharpness echo that of another New Yorker artist, William Steig.
Her style has evolved since then. It's no less caffeinated — her hues are, at times, so buzzy you might squint — but she's added cream and sugar. Kalman has an eye for the sweetly preposterous, like those knee socks for a leggy tot. She likes cake, hats, and, of course, dogs.
Her mother was terrified of dogs, but the artist adores them, and they appear in every one of her books. Sam, a Wheaten Terrier and dear companion after Tibor died in 1999, had such a gleefully rapacious appetite, Kalman wrote “What Pete Ate From A-Z (Really!)" an alphabet book listing everything he gobbled down (including a camera and a variety of shoes).
Her children's books plug right into a child's wide open viewpoint, and sometimes address how terribly confusing the world is.
In her book about Jefferson, for instance, she begins, “Thomas Jefferson had red hair and some freckles (about 20 I think), and he grew to be very tall and oh yes, he was the third President of the United States." All important matters, as is Jefferson's role in the formation of the United States.
As are his personal conflicts about slavery. She paints the cramped, sparse slave quarters at Monticello and a ledger of the enslaved, which lists Sally Hemings, the alleged mother of several of Jefferson's children. “If you want to understand this country and its people," Kalman writes, “and what it means to be optimistic and complex and tragic and wrong and courageous, you need to go to Monticello."
This exhibition pulls illustrations off the page and puts them on the walls and into three dimensions. One of the bustling Grand Central murals hangs above a bench and beside an information kiosk, with an inviting character in every window. There are giant cakes to decorate or climb on, and Pete the terrier shows up quite large with magnets to play with, depicting things he ate.
But Kalman is not just for kids. She has illustrated, for instance, a version of Strunk and White's legendary “The Elements of Style." That photo of a Basset Hound in the entryway is here converted to a droll illustration of the phrase, “Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
Her hopeful consideration of democracy, “And the Pursuit of Happiness," appeared first as an illustrated blog in The New York Times after President Obama was inaugurated. I wonder what she might produce about today's state of affairs. Let's hope she's working on something, and it's full of dogs.

Texto completo: Californians want education to be affordable. They also want great universities. But with costs rising and tuition basically frozen since 2011, something has to give. The University of California system needs a tuition hike.
The fairest way to do this is through "cohort-based tuition," a proposal the University of California's Board of Regents will consider at its Jan. 22 meeting.
Under a cohort-based model, tuition is set at the time a student enters a UC degree program and then is kept flat for that cohort for the next six years as long as a student remains enrolled. Any changes in tuition would apply only to new, incoming cohorts.

The proposal would be a huge help to campuses in planning and programming, since they would be able to project tuition revenue from continuing students and thus have a clearer sense of future resources. The approach also provides sorely needed predictability for students and their families, allowing them to know what they will be paying each year.
In the past, that was a huge problem. Between 2000 and 2010, undergraduate in-state tuition rose in nine out of 10 years, with increases ranging from $384 to $1,818 per year. Students and their parents were understandably upset about the unpredictable cost of attending college and the challenge of meeting ever-higher fees.
But the response to the situation -- a virtual tuition freeze for the next nine years -- is unsustainable.
In California, higher education spending accounted for 18% of the 1976-77 state budget, but by 2019-20, funding had fallen to 12% of the state budget. These cuts have been felt most strongly at the University of California, where state funding per full-time student fell from nearly $29,000 per year to less than $13,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars. In recent years, the state has also required the university to take substantially more students.
Gov. Gavin Newsom's newly proposed budget for next year includes a welcome 5% increase in state funds for the University of California, but this does not begin to offset the need for a tuition increase. Since state funds are only 42% of the core funds the UC relies on to educate students, an increase of 5% in state support translates into a 2.1% increase in the budget, which barely covers inflation. The budget proposal also mandates that schools serve more students. An increase in tuition is essential simply for the UCs to stay even, without beginning to make up for a decade of cuts and frozen tuition.
Since 2011, annual tuition has been raised only once, by $282 (about 2.5%) in 2017. Meanwhile, in other states, tuition continued to rise during that period. According to the College Board, "in-state tuition and fees at public four-year institutions increased at an average rate of 2.2% per year beyond inflation" between 2009 and 20019. And that figure is what was raised beyond inflation. The UC system faced the same kind of inflation and increased costs during the period, with almost no increase in tuition.
Without substantial additional funds, class sizes will grow, students will find it harder to take the classes they need to graduate, recruiting and retaining top faculty will be much harder and there will have to be cuts in funding for important research. Those assertions aren't made lightly or with the intent of frightening potential students. They are simply the grim reality.
Of course, students struggling to pay for school are alarmed at the idea of any increase in tuition. But frozen tuition also hurts the students who most need financial assistance from the university. The nontuition costs of attending college -- books, health insurance, rent and food -- increased by 17.8% from 2012 to 2018, but the university has had no additional funds to help needy students meet those increases because of the freeze. We need to simultaneously increase both tuition and financial aid. The UC system redirects about one-third of undergraduate tuition income -- more than $750 million per year -- toward financial aid for lower- and middle-income state residents, and that should continue.
It is impossible to overstate the importance of the University of California to the state and its residents, especially in its promotion of social and economic mobility. According to a New York Times study, six of the top seven universities in terms of the economic diversity of their students were UC campuses. The system's strong public mission makes it different from even the best private schools, but that hasn't sacrificed quality. The universities' research in countless fields continues to be invaluable.
Today, the state's residents -- and the UC regents -- are at a point where they must decide whether to continue to have a great university system. The path of the last decade, if continued, will undermine quality in a way that cannot be easily restored. The regents should approve cohort-based tuition and implement predictable tuition increases to maintain and enhance the quality of the country's finest public university system, the University of California.
